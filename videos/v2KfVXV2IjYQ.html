00:00:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h00m04s">So I had this landlord in Montreal. He lived next door to me, and he was an ex-Hell's Angel's biker.</a>
00:00:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h00m09s">he'd spend a lot of time in prison and his wife had borderline personality disorder and she committed suicide when I lived there and</a>
00:00:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h00m16s">He was a rough guy, and he was at québécois, and he spoke *french dialect". Which I could hardly understand and</a>
00:00:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h00m23s">He didn't really know what to make of me, and I didn't really know what to make of him</a>
00:00:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h00m27s">But we got along</a>
00:00:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h00m29s">You know, I was very careful talking to him as you might imagine</a>
00:00:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h00m34s">but</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h00m34s">But, I was, it was very... and we went over, my wife and I went over there, and we had the spaghetti dinner one</a>
00:00:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h00m39s">night, and we sort of communicated</a>
00:00:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h00m41s">And I bought a poster from him because he made these wooden posters that had neon on them</a>
00:00:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h00m45s">And that's how he made a living he'd kind of trained himself to be a bit of an electronics guy</a>
00:00:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h00m49s">So he made these things and he was trying to quit drinking and we talked about that. He was a lot older than me</a>
00:00:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h00m53s">He was like 20 years older than me. I was about 25 at this point and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h00m58s">we got along pretty well, but</a>
00:00:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h01m01s">Every now and then he'd go out and get - and drink and he could really drink</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h01m05s">You know like he was one of these guys who could drink like</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h01m14s">subjects' fathers drank 40 ounces of vodka a day and had been doing it for 20 years</a>
00:01:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h01m18s">So you can drink a lot and he could drink a lot and - what would happen</a>
00:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h01m22s">he was trying to not drink, but he'd go out and go on a binge</a>
00:01:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h01m24s">And then he'd be going for like three days, and he'd drink up all his money, and then we'd hear him out in the backyard</a>
00:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h01m32s">howling at the moon with this little little ugly dog he had you know and</a>
00:01:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h01m36s">He'd howling the dog would howl and he'd howl and the dog would howl and and it was rather unsettling and made my wife nervous</a>
00:01:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h01m43s">and <em>laughter</em></a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h01m47s">But worse, you know now,  then he'd come to the door at like, 3:00 in the morning,</a>
00:01:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h01m52s">eh, he'd knock on the door, and he'd be standing there and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h02m07s">Unconscious at the same time, and so that was the state that he was in, you know, he'd be just swaying.</a>
00:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h02m13s">He'd asked me if I would like to buy his toaster or his microwave</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h02m17s">because he needed some money to keep drinking, and, you know, I didn't really want to buy his toaster or his microwave, but when</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h02m58s">Even though she was afraid of him. She liked him, and and she said, "You can't buy anymore...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h03m04s">Anymore appliances, because it's not good for him," and I thought, huh,</a>
00:03:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h03m10s">That's an interesting problem. You know? So what the hell am I going to do about this? Because</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h03m15s">"No, I don't want to buy your microwave," just doesn't seem to be the right answer at 3:00 in the morning</a>
00:03:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h03m20s">so</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h03m50s">He got into like four fights that night because - he was a rough guy, you know, and these kind of punk</a>
00:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h03m55s">guys would come up to him, and sort of challenge him, and act stupidly around him, and he was very skeptical and if you were</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h04m01s">acting stupidly around him for any length of time, he'd just hit you because he felt that that's what you deserved and perhaps</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h04m06s">he was right, you know, so, so, I had</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h04m12s">So, anyways, he - sure enough - about a week or two after we had this conversation</a>
00:04:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h04m18s">he showed up at the door "knock knock knock." You know, open the door, and he's standing there</a>
00:04:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h04m22s">you know, with his eyes kind of half closed, and he was swaying,</a>
00:04:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h04m26s">and he had - I don't remember what the appliance was this time, but he wanted to sell it to me and</a>
00:04:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h04m31s">I said</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h04m47s">What else did I tell him? I think I told him as well that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h04m51s">This whole thing of him coming to my house at like 2:00 in the morning</a>
00:04:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h04m55s">Was scaring my wife, who he liked, and that it had to stop. And believe me man, I was thinking about what I was saying</a>
00:04:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h05m01s">Because he was watching me</a>
00:05:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h05m03s">Like a rough guy watches you, and a rough guy watches you like this. He thinks, "if you say one thing that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h05m11s">indicates</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h05m14s">You're going to bloody well pay for it." and so I was finding my words, like, you know,</a>
00:05:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h05m19s">I was crossing a swamp and trying to look for the - for the rocks underneath the surface and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h05m24s">I said what I had to say very, very carefully. And he looked at me for about 15 seconds and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfVXV2IjYQ#t=00h05m30s">That's a long time to be looked at, at 3:00 in the morning. <em>laughter</em></a>
