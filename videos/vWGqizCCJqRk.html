00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h00m02s">and the coachman's already said
he's collecting bad little boys,</a>
00:00:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h00m07s">and he's got them all on the coach,
they're all delinquent-types here,</a>
00:00:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h00m13s">and the ticket on the coach
was the Ace of Spades,</a>
00:00:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h00m15s">which is what Pinocchio is holding,</a>
00:00:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h00m18s">and he's with this character here
called Lampwick.</a>
00:00:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h00m22s">That's an interesting name.</a>
00:00:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h00m23s">So he's the thing that burns in the middle of a light,
Lampwick, and that's interesting</a>
00:00:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h00m29s">because it's a play on "Lucifer",
because Lucifer means "bringer of light",</a>
00:00:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h00m33s">and so Lampwick is a play on that.
Lampwick is really a nasty piece of work,</a>
00:00:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h00m39s">he's got this false arrogance about him,
he's got this cynical voice,</a>
00:00:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h00m43s">this really deeply cynical voice, and he's only...
I don't know how old he's supposed to be in this,</a>
00:00:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h00m47s">maybe twelve or thirteen,</a>
00:00:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h00m49s">and so he's one of those kids
who's become prematurely cynical.</a>
00:00:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h00m56s">I'll tell you a story about that:
so I used to live in Montréal,</a>
00:00:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h01m00s">I lived in a poor neighbourhood,
and one day I was in the back alley building a fence,</a>
00:01:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h01m07s">because I was putting a little fence
around my little tiny backyard,</a>
00:01:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h01m10s">and there was a house,
across the alley, down the street a-ways</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h01m14s">where there was a lot of not-good partying,
a lot of bikers were hanging around there,</a>
00:01:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h01m20s">I knew there was a little kid that lived there as well.</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h01m23s">And anyways, I was out there in the back alley,
pounding away on my fence,</a>
00:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h01m26s">and these little kids came up.
And they were little,</a>
00:01:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h01m27s">they were like, three and four years old,
and they spoke Joual,</a>
00:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h01m34s">a really heavily-accented Québécois French,
and so, my French isn't good,</a>
00:01:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h01m39s">so I could hardly understand them,
but they were watching me hammer,</a>
00:01:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h01m43s">and they got a little closer,
and they had one kid, who was clearly the leader,</a>
00:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h01m47s">had a real scowl on his face, hey,</a>
00:01:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h01m48s">and so they were watching,
and I kind of motioned to one of them</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h01m51s">that they could use the hammer,
and that kid said,</a>
00:01:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h01m55s">and I'm going to mangle this, but he said:
"je volais", or something like that,</a>
00:01:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h01m58s">and what it meant was "I'll steal that",</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h02m01s">and so I thought,
and then he came over and tugged on it,</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h02m04s">and he wanted me to take it,
and he was quite angry.</a>
00:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h02m07s">Well, I wasn't going to let him take it,
and then, so I couldn't engage him,</a>
00:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h02m12s">I couldn't get him to play, you know,
his buddies were sort of hanging around behind him.</a>
00:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h02m16s">They wouldn't come and play
because he wouldn't,</a>
00:02:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h02m18s">so he was hostile right away to me.</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h02m21s">And then,</a>
00:02:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h02m23s">so the fence piece was laying out in the alley,
and these little monsters started running across it!</a>
00:02:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h02m29s">Which I thought was really remarkable,
you know, but it was terrible at the same time,</a>
00:02:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h02m34s">because they were really little kids,
that shouldn't be happening when you're three or four.</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h02m38s">If that's happening at that age,
things are not good.</a>
00:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h02m41s">And so that kid was already
seriously not happy with the world.</a>
00:02:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h02m46s">And, you know, I'd been studying
anti-social behaviour for a long time by that point,</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h02m50s">and I knew that the kids
who are destined to jail later in their lives</a>
00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h02m54s">are kids who are rough and tough
when they're two years old,</a>
00:02:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h02m58s">but then don't get socialised,
or maybe worse, they get anti-socialised,</a>
00:02:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h03m01s">which is exactly what happened to this kid,
he'd obviously been ignored and abused,</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h03m06s">certainly no one had ever played with him
in any real way</a>
00:03:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h03m10s">because he wouldn't play,
and it's not good if a kid is that little</a>
00:03:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h03m14s">and you can't get them to play,
something's gone seriously wrong.</a>
00:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h03m17s">Because they're so playful at that age,
it's like 90% of them.</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h03m21s">Anyways, so they were running
back and forth on this fence,</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h03m24s">and stomping on it, you know,
and I was right there!</a>
00:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h03m27s">I thought, well, first of all,
I thought that was remarkable,</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h03m31s">but I also thought it was absolutely horrifying,</a>
00:03:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h03m33s">because in some sense I could see
where this kid was headed and why,</a>
00:03:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h03m38s">at that early stage in his life,
it's really...</a>
00:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h03m41s">...it's not a pleasant thing to behold,
but there was nothing that could be done about it.</a>
00:03:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h03m45s">And that's kind of what this Lampwick is like,
he's prematurely cynical.</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h03m49s">This kid was already cynical when he was,
like, four years old.</a>
00:03:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h03m51s">You know, most kids don't get cynical
until they're teenagers.</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h03m55s">And then often they don't get completely cynical,
and usually they more or less grow out of it.</a>
00:03:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h04m00s">But it had happened to him much earlier.</a>
00:04:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h04m03s">So this Lampwick character,
he's already decided that he knows everything,</a>
00:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h04m07s">that everyone else's opinion is worth nothing,
and that there's nothing in culture or society</a>
00:04:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h04m14s">that holds any utility whatsoever
for someone like him.</a>
00:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h04m18s">Now, you can imagine developing that way,</a>
00:04:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h04m21s">if you were raised in a family
where people were generally lying to you,</a>
00:04:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h04m25s">and that they randomly treated you,
or neglected you,</a>
00:04:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h04m28s">and that you couldn't discern anything about them
that was admirable or positive.</a>
00:04:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h04m34s">Of course you'd assume that
the whole structure is corrupt,</a>
00:04:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h04m38s">and that you had to take care of yourself,
and no one else.</a>
00:04:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h04m41s">Well, not "of course",
not everyone assumes that under those situations,</a>
00:04:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h04m44s">I shouldn't say "of course".</a>
00:04:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h04m45s">But it's a logical set of conclusions.</a>
00:04:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h04m50s">And of course, it's proportionate to some degree
to how much abuse you take.</a>
00:04:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h04m53s">Although there are lots of stories of people
being terribly abused as children,</a>
00:04:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h04m57s">who grew up to be kind, remarkable,
responsible, thoughtful people,</a>
00:04:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h05m04s">who absolutely opposed to abuse
instead of propogating it.</a>
00:05:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqizCCJqRk#t=00h05m08s">There's no direct causal pathway.</a>
