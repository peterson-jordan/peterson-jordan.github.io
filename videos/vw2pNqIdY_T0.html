And then finally with regards to the individual</a>
00:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h01m23s">we spent a substantial amount of time discussing
the individual’s capability capacity to</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h01m38s">culture and nature have their negative aspects

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h01m43s">And I think personally this is where Christian
mythology in particular comes into its own</a>
00:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h01m50s">I think of all the major religions Christianity
has the most thoroughly developed what you</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h01m58s">might describe as formal model of evil and
that model isn't part of the canonical writings</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h02m04s">of Christianity say encapsulated in the Bible
but part of cloud of sort of natural mythology</a>
00:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h02m11s">and storytelling that surrounds the canonical
writings</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h02m14s">so you could say that although Christainity
and Buddhism have spent a substantial amount</a>
00:02:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h02m20s">of time developing up a representation of
the hero Christianity in particular has also</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h02m26s">spent a substantial amount of time developing
a formal portrait of the figure that stands</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h02m33s">in opposition to the hero
and I think the most appropriate term for</a>
00:02:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h02m36s">that figure who takes multiple forms in mythology
is the adversary because the adversarial spirit</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h02m45s">is a spirit that stands in opposition to everything
Stands in opposition to nature stands in opposition</a>
00:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h02m53s">to culture and most specifically stands in
opposition to that aspect of the human being</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h02m59s">that’s both exploratory and creative
Now the last time we talked I had a chance</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h03m05s">to describe to you how the figures of the
adversarial brothers emerged naturally at</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h03m13s">the end of genesis as a coda to the story

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h03m18s">they develop knowledge of their own mortality

of the hostile brothers which is to say that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h03m30s">if you're the child of nature the child of
culture this sort of ultimate parents then</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h03m36s">as an individual you take two forms a positive
form and a negative form</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h03m40s">and the negative form is characterized in
many ways by the kind of absolute hatred of</a>
00:03:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h03m45s">the good hatred of the positive form and I
think that you can’t understand the full</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h03m53s">human propensity for evil without considering
more than the territoriality more than the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h04m00s">innate territoriality of human being
so if you look at animals well animals are</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h04m04s">territorial and they fight to preserve their
territory and it’s a rational struggle they're</a>
00:04:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h04m10s">fighting for resources and for a place that
they can that they can operate and live in</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h04m15s">and reproduce in efficiently
but human beings are substantively different</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h04m20s">from that in that their agonistic conflict
their aggression often seems to be motivated</a>
00:04:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h04m26s">by something more akin to the pure desire
for destruction rather than for any rational</a>
00:04:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h04m31s">end whatsoever
And so from that perspective I would say as</a>
00:04:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h04m37s">an example the fact that Hitler ended up committing
suicide in a bunker beneath Germany’s capital</a>
00:04:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h04m44s">at the end of the second world war when Berlin
was in flames when all of Germany was in flames</a>
00:04:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h04m48s">and when his country was completely defeated
after tens of millions of people had died</a>
00:04:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h04m52s">in the conflict including of course the 7
million or so people that were killed in the</a>
00:04:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h04m56s">Holocaust.</a>
00:04:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h04m57s">the normal mode of interpretation of that
would be what a terrible defeat for Hitler</a>
00:04:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h05m03s">but an equally valid and I think um an equally
valid prima facie argument and one I think</a>
00:05:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h05m09s">that’s actually more valid is that wasn’t
a defeat for Hitler at all it was precisely</a>
00:05:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h05m14s">what he was aiming at right from the beginning
because his mode of being was intensely adversarial</a>
00:05:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h05m21s">And I would also say that it’s certainly
possible that the full nature of these motivations</a>
00:05:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h05m25s">weren't even necessarily clear to him As they
unfolded across time during the second world</a>
00:05:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h05m31s">war no more than the full motivations of any
human being are necessarily accessible to</a>
00:05:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h05m36s">them as they act out whatever it is that they
act out</a>
00:05:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h05m39s">so Carl Jung says for example that we act
out great mythological stories that doesn’t</a>
00:05:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h05m44s">necessarily mean you know the story just means
you act it out</a>
00:05:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h05m48s">so for example you see people whose lives
are repetitive bouts of tragedy and what they're</a>
00:05:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h05m54s">acting out is a tragic story and they know
it insofar as they're actually acting it out</a>
00:05:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h05m59s">but they don’t necessarily have an explicit
model of the relationship between their patterns</a>
00:05:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h06m04s">of behaviour and the constantly tragic outcome
they produce</a>
00:06:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h06m07s">Well that doesn’t even necessarily mean
that what they're doing isn't voluntary Because</a>
00:06:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h06m11s">things can be voluntary even if you don’t
understand them fully</a>
00:06:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h06m16s">There's an aspect to the human psyche that’s
a “nest of vipers” so to speak because</a>
00:06:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h06m20s">you can’t necessarily trust what you see
and that means not only when you're looking</a>
00:06:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h06m24s">at someone else say but even when you're looking
in the mirror you can’t be sure that what</a>
00:06:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h06m28s">you say you're doing is exactly what you're
doing.</a>
00:06:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h06m31s">Your motivations aren't transparent and they
may not even be clear</a>
00:06:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h06m39s">so I suppose the idea that lurks behind this
formalization is that freedom of choice is</a>
00:06:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h06m45s">such a good that one of its subsidiary necessities
which is that there has to be a polar distinction</a>
00:06:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h06m53s">between good and evil is worth having freedom
is so important that it justifies the distinction</a>
00:06:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h06m59s">between good and evil
and I think that art I think that’s a reasonable</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h07m03s">way to presume It’s reasonable to presume
that that’s the manner in which experience</a>
00:07:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h07m11s">is actually structured and there's complex
reasons for that</a>
00:07:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h07m13s">one would be that under the most optimal circumstances
which is something we’ll talk about as this</a>
00:07:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h07m19s">proceeds to a close that means in a sense
you can have your cake and eat it too</a>
00:07:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h07m24s">Which means the potential existence of good
and evil allows for freedom of choice And</a>
00:07:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h07m29s">then if the choice is always towards the good
then you have the benefits of freedom of choice</a>
00:07:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2pNqIdY_T0#t=00h07m34s">plus the benefits of the good the only price

What if that was the case So the idea here</a>
