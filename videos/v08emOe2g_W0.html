					<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h00m00s">OK, so the question is, can that sense of meaning be hijacked?</a>
00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h00m03s">And the answer to that is, absolutely. Absolutely.</a>
00:00:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h00m06s">Because you could say that the ultimate sense of meaning is composed of the union of fragmentary senses of meaning</a>
00:00:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h00m13s">And the fragmentary senses of meaning can be overwhelmingly powerful</a>
00:00:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h00m16s">Anger. Sexual lust. And the sorts of things you experience, say, when you're playing a video game</a>
00:00:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h00m22s">Which are very carefully calibrated to keep you on the edge of exploration, let's say.</a>
00:00:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h00m28s">Now, I'm not a foe of video games, because games are complicated and it isn't clear what people are doing when they're playing them</a>
00:00:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h00m35s">You know, they may be expanding their cognitive skills.</a>
00:00:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h00m38s">They may be learning to cooperate.</a>
00:00:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h00m40s">They may be learning to engage in complex problem-solving.</a>
00:00:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h00m42s">And so, but -- Part of it's also a matter of balance. You know...</a>
00:00:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h00m48s">Fifty hours a week, probably not. Unless you're gonna go pro. Right?</a>
00:00:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h00m52s">Because there's other things you need to be attending to.</a>
00:00:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h00m56s">It's not a stable solution for you, your family, your society.</a>
00:00:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h01m01s">It's too one-sided.</a>
00:01:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h01m02s">Yeah, and you can get pulled down rabbit holes of all sorts that are one-sided pursuits of meaning.</a>
00:01:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h01m09s">So-- And that's something we're actually going to talk about as the later classes unfold</a>
00:01:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h01m13s">The question is, how do you stop yourself from falling prey to a pathologized sense of meaning?</a>
00:01:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h01m19s">And I think one of the answers to that is:
Don't lie.</a>
00:01:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h01m22s">Because what you're hoping is that your nervous system is sufficiently healthy and well-programmed so that what it reads out to you is reliable.</a>
00:01:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h01m32s">And if you pathologize your psyche by--</a>
00:01:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h01m37s">Either through sins of omission, let's say, or outright deception,</a>
00:01:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h01m41s">you're going to warp that internal structure and it's not going to read out properly to you.</a>
00:01:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h01m45s">And then your sense of meaning will lead you astray.</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h01m48s">So, like, one of the reasons for speaking the truth--</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h01m52s">I shouldn't say that, because you don't know how to speak the truth, but you do know how not to lie.</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h01m56s">And... It's a game you're playing with yourself. You can define the damn lies; no one else has to do that for you.</a>
00:01:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h02m03s">You try not to utter falsehoods</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h02m06s">cause you warp your neurological structure by doing so</a>
00:02:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h02m09s">and then it will read out pathologically.</a>
00:02:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h02m11s">And then if you rely on it to guide you it will run you right off a cliff.</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h02m15s">So, that's why there's a moral element to this.</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h02m18s">If you're going to rely on your sense of meaning</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h02m20s">make sure that you don't pollute the mechanism.</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h02m25s">See, this is partly why people go to confession.</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h02m29s">Right? Which is, like I said, a psychotherapeutic technique.</a>
00:02:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h02m32s">It's like, okay, what stupid, miserable, wretched things did I do this week?</a>
00:02:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h02m37s">Well, that's a good thing to make conscious, right?</a>
00:02:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h02m40s">Because maybe you can not do them the next week.</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h02m42s">And you think, well why would you bother?</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h02m44s">It's like, well, you're in a ship. It's sailing across the stormy seas.</a>
00:02:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h02m50s">If you're hacking holes in it with a pickaxe you should probably pay attention to that before you sink.</a>
00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h02m57s">So, it's a good idea to keep what you're doing that's stupid in mind, so that you can stop doing it.</a>
00:02:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h03m03s">And so, then you can more and more rely on yourself, and your own... you know, your own conscience, let's say, as a guide to proper action.</a>
00:03:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h03m12s">You know, in the Pinocchio story, the conscience was not an unerring guide for Pinocchio.</a>
00:03:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h03m18s">It had to learn.</a>
00:03:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h03m20s">And so-- It's also partly pushing yourself into new situations</a>
00:03:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h03m25s">And differentiating yourself so that you get wiser.</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h03m28s">And so it's courage as well as truth.</a>
00:03:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h03m32s">Those might be the two... There's more:</a>
00:03:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h03m35s">Beauty, courage, truth. You know, the fundamental virtues.</a>
00:03:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h03m40s">Why be virtuous? That's the question.</a>
00:03:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h03m42s">It's so that you can bear the suffering of life without becoming corrupt.</a>
00:03:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h03m48s">Right. It's practical.</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h03m51s">It's practical. There's nothing more practical than that.</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h03m55s">So, unless you want misery -- and people do, you know.</a>
00:03:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h03m58s">It's exciting, misery.</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h04m01s">So. Other questions?</a>
00:04:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h04m05s">All right, then.</a>
00:04:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08emOe2g_W0#t=00h04m08s">See you next Wednesday. [applause]</a>
