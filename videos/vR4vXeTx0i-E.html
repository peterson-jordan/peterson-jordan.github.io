<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h00m56s">So my question is related to an interview you did with Camille Paglia</a>
00:00:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h01m00s">not long ago, and you were referring to Robert Sapolsky's</a>
00:01:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h01m04s">work about the zebras and how if the lions don't go after the zebras because they're</a>
00:01:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h01m10s">camouflaged into the herd, not the landscape.</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h01m13s">And Sapolsky would put a red dot on a hunch and</a>
00:01:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h01m17s">The Lions would then go after that Zebra and I get that I believe that's true</a>
00:01:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h01m22s">But my question, how do the lions</a>
00:01:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h01m25s">communicate with each other to go after the one zebra with the red dot?</a>
00:01:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h01m31s">Well, I think the answer to that is that lions are a lot smarter than we think they are.</a>
00:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h01m36s">you know well, you think about it, you know like</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h01m39s">hunting animals have to be very very intelligent when they hunt in packs</a>
00:01:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h01m43s">because they're obviously communicating with one another constantly and</a>
00:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h01m46s">they isolate an individual that's identifiable in some sense</a>
00:01:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h01m51s">and they seem to be able to determine</a>
00:01:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h01m52s">perhaps from its behavior, perhaps because of the behavior of the hunters</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h01m56s">what that animal is.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h01m59s">But I mean, to be a predator means to manifest substantial intelligence</a>
00:01:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h02m03s">and I don't think we understand it very well at all.</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h02m05s">(I agree, I think you're telepathic)</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h02m07s">Yeah, well animals are strange, you know? You know how they can pick up your emotions</a>
00:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h02m11s">They're, they're very good at decoding nonverbal behavior</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h02m14s">And so they're communicating through their posture and so forth, but I don't think we understand it very well at all</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h02m50s">Well, you know I really think Faculties of Education should probably just be burned to the ground</a>
00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h02m56s">you know, I mean</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h02m59s">They're failing them.</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h03m01s">They're, they're failing.</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h03m02s">The Faculties of Education in particular are failing them in a variety of ways</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h03m06s">The first is that I've seen no evidence coming from the Faculties of Education that our understanding of how to educate children</a>
00:03:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h03m13s">more efficiently has progressed at all in the last 40 years.</a>
00:03:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h03m18s">In fact, I think it's gone backwards.</a>
00:03:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h03m19s">And a lot of the things the faculties of Education had pushed, like self esteem,</a>
00:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h03m24s">which actually doesn't exist because it's measured improperly,</a>
00:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h03m27s">like whole word learning for example</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h03m30s">like multiple intelligences.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h03m31s">All these things have actually set the cause of Education back substantially</a>
00:03:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h03m35s">because they're not based on anything that's real</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h03m39s">and then the introduction of... of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h03m41s">well, this... this very complex gender education to me is nothing but ideology it's being introduced</a>
00:03:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h03m49s">To children who are far too young and who have enough</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h03m53s">confusion in their life without adding that additional dimension.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h03m56s">But most importantly I think that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h03m59s">The education system.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h04m04s">it doesn't teach them to think about thinking, so they can't think critically.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h04m08s">And it does almost nothing to help them understand that they have a character that they could develop.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h04m14s">You know, I mean this has been true for a very long time</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h04m18s">and there's historical reasons for it. But, be very good, you know to</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h04m25s">(Um, college)</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vXeTx0i-E#t=00h04m30s">like no one's ever sat down with most of those kids</a>
