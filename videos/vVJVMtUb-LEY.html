00:00:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h01m01s">well that's you know obvious it's like</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h01m09s">particles and space you can array those</a>

00:01:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h01m18s">ways are real too the patterns are real</a>
00:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h01m20s">too so and without without the space you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h01m25s">can't do that so atoms plus space gives</a>
00:01:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h01m27s">rise to something else and really what</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h01m28s">it gives rise to as far as I can tell is</a>
00:01:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h01m31s">something very much like information now</a>
00:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h01m33s">information is a very complicated idea</a>
00:01:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h01m36s">what information is but that's okay we</a>
00:01:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h01m38s">won't go into that at the moment to</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h01m40s">think about music right music is like</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h01m43s">atoms of sound right because they're</a>
00:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h01m46s">they're discrete quanta of sound</a>
00:01:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h01m48s">essentially they're rainout in patterns</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h01m50s">across time and obviously the pattern</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h01m54s">the music is is not just the note it's</a>
00:01:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h01m57s">the pattern across time okay so one of</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h01m59s">the things we might say is that well</a>
00:01:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h02m01s">there's atoms in their space and there's</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h02m03s">patterns</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h02m03s">okay so patterns now what are the most</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h02m07s">fundamental patterns okay so let's put</a>
00:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h02m10s">it this way we're gonna say well what's</a>
00:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h02m11s">your problem how to live in the world</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h02m14s">what's the world well roughly speaking</a>
00:02:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h02m19s">the problem is how to live as an</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h02m23s">individual in society and nature it's</a>
00:02:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h02m28s">something like that okay so then we're</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h02m31s">gonna say okay if that's the actual</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h02m32s">problem the first thing you have to do</a>
00:02:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h02m34s">to solve that is to conceptualize</a>

00:02:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h02m40s">individual so you have to represent them</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h02m42s">somehow</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h02m42s">okay so how should you represent society</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h02m46s">and nature and the individual and the</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h02m48s">answer to that is that's complicated</a>
00:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h02m51s">it's not obvious now we kind of know for</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h02m53s">example that one way of representing</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h03m00s">representing and it's a way of being in</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h03m08s">we can think about a dominance hierarchy</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h03m10s">society is more than a dominance</a>

00:03:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJVMtUb-LEY#t=00h03m14s">first approximation and then we can</a>
