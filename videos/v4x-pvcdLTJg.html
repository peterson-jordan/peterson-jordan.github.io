<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h01m23s">More or less that's being accepted as canonical fact ever since and then the scientists say well. Yeah, those are empirical truths</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h02m02s">And people have always thought that way first of all you do not think like a scientist even scientists hardly even think like scientists</a>
00:02:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h02m09s">But if you're not scientifically trained you don't think like a scientist at all so one of the things for example</a>
00:02:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h02m15s">That characterizes your thinking is confirmation bias</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h02m18s">And so if you have a theory what you do is wander around in the world looking for reasons</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h02m22s">Why it's true and the scientist does exactly the opposite of that in</a>

00:02:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h02m34s">But believe me you don't run around doing that. I mean you you can train yourself</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h02m39s">So now and then you can do that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h02m40s">You know you can learn to listen to people for example on the off chance that you might be wrong</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h02m45s">But that is by no means a natural way of thinking and of course</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h03m04s">Anyways the name escapes me at the moment, but you can argue about when science emerged, but you you it certainly emerged in its</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h03m14s">I think you could say even more specifically that it emerged in the last</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h03m18s">Five hundred years now you might argue with that and say well, what about the greeks and other people who were?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h03m24s">Fairly technologically sophisticated or who invented geometry or that kind of thing, but yeah? Yeah?</a>

00:06:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h06m25s">So what do we do about that?</a>
00:06:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h06m27s">Well if you're on the scientific atheist end of things you say well those old stories are just superstitious science second-rate</a>
00:06:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h06m34s">Barbaric Archaic forms of science you just dispense with them. They're nothing but trouble</a>
00:06:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h06m40s">The fundamental aside you say well, we'll try to shoehorn science into this framework and really that doesn't work very well</a>
00:06:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h06m46s">it doesn't work very well with the claims of evolution for example fact it works very badly, and that's a problem because</a>
00:06:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h06m53s">Evolutionary Theory is like</a>
00:06:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h06m54s">it's a killer theory that's really it's</a>
00:06:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h06m58s">it's really really hard and like it's not a complete theory and there's lots of things we don't know about evolution but</a>
00:06:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h07m04s">you know</a>
00:07:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h07m07s">Trying to hand-wave that away. That's that's not going to work without dispensing with most of biology, so</a>
00:07:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h07m15s">so that's a big problem, so</a>
00:07:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h07m17s">Here's another way of thinking about it</a>
00:07:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h07m21s">You don't just need one way of looking at the world</a>
00:07:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h07m24s">Maybe you need two ways of looking at the world, and I'm not exactly sure how they should be</a>
00:07:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h07m29s">Related to one another like which should take precedence under which circumstance, but one problem is what's the world made of?</a>
00:07:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h07m38s">you know what's the world conceptualize as an objective place made of</a>
00:07:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h07m43s">another is how should you conduct yourself while you're alive and</a>
00:07:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h07m47s">There's no reason to assume that those questions can be answered</a>
00:07:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h07m52s">using the same approach I</a>
00:07:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h07m55s">mean</a>
00:07:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h07m57s">Physics has its methods and chemistry has its methods and biology has its methods so a method for obtaining</a>
00:07:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h08m05s">the truth can be bound to a domain</a>
00:08:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h08m07s">So why would we necessarily assume that you could use the same set of tools to</a>
00:08:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h08m13s">Represent the world as a place of objects and to represent it as a place in which a biological creature would act</a>
00:08:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h08m19s">in any ways I'm suggesting that we</a>
00:08:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h08m24s">That we don't view it that way that we have two different Viewpoints</a>
00:08:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h08m29s">Maybe they can be brought together although</a>
00:08:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h08m31s">It's not obvious how but that it's not a tenable solution to get rid of one in</a>
00:08:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h08m36s">favor of the other and I think the reason for that is that</a>
00:08:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h08m42s">You need to know how to conduct yourself in the world you have to have a value system</a>
00:08:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h08m47s">You can't even look at the damn world without a value system</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h08m50s">It's not possible your emotional health is depending on a value system</a>
00:08:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h08m55s">The way you interact with other people is dependent on a value system. There's no getting away from it and you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h09m01s">There's no justification for any value system from a scientific perspective</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h09m05s">You draw that conclusion that no value system is valid where the hell does that leave you there's no down</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h09m11s">There's no up. There's no rationale for moving in any Direction</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h09m15s">There's not even really any rationale for living and so people say say things like that</a>
00:09:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h09m19s">Well, why why the hell should I care what happens in a million years? Who's going to know the difference? It's like yeah</a>
00:09:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h09m24s">Yeah, true stupid, but true and the reason I think it's stupid is because it's just a game</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h09m31s">You know I can take anything of any sort and find a context in which it's irrelevant</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h09m44s">What do you say to someone who says that you say well seems like the wrong frame of reference Bucko?</a>
00:09:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h09m50s">That's what it looks like to me you know because at some point you question the damn frame of reference</a>
00:09:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x-pvcdLTJg#t=00h09m55s">Not what you derive from it, and it certainly seems to me that situations like that</a>
