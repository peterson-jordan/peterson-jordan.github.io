00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h00m04s">Well, it's definitely a cliché.</a>
00:00:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h00m06s">And it, you know... it's the sort of thing that actually annoys me quite a lot</a>
00:00:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h00m12s">about New Age thinkers, and I would more or less put Joseph Campbell in that category.</a>
00:00:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h00m17s">Um...</a>
00:00:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h00m21s">I think you can find what compels you,</a>
00:00:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h00m25s">and what might enable you to live</a>
00:00:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h00m28s">in a high quality manner, despite the suffering that's associated with life.</a>
00:00:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h00m32s">I think you can discover that, and I think part of the way you discover that is by: watching yourself,</a>
00:00:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h00m38s">and learning when it is, that you're meaningfully engaged.</a>
00:00:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h00m43s">You have to notice that.</a>
00:00:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h00m46s">It's something that happens to you, in some sense, rather than something that you do.</a>
00:00:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h00m51s">You have to notice when you're meaningfully engaged.</a>
00:00:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h00m54s">And then you have to work to expand the amount of time that you spend in that state.</a>
00:00:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h01m00s">But I would also say that there are moral requirements that go along with that too,</a>
00:01:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h01m04s">because you might say, well, what if you happen to be this sort of person</a>
00:01:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h01m07s">for example, who finds torturing small animals meaningfully engaging?</a>
00:01:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h01m12s">Um</a>
00:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h01m14s">It seems like that's the sort of meaningful engagement that you probably don't want to expand.</a>
00:01:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h01m20s">So I would say that if you're going to set up your life,</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h01m23s">so that you maximize your meaningful engagement, you have to...</a>
00:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h01m26s">There's a number of other things that you have to do at the same time.</a>
00:01:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h01m29s">And one of those is that you have to get very clear about...</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h01m33s">um</a>
00:01:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h01m34s">...who you are and what you're doing.</a>
00:01:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h01m36s">And so, although this would be grounds for a much longer discussion,</a>
00:01:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h01m39s">I think that one of the things that you HAVE to do if you're going to attempt to maximize meaningful engagement,</a>
00:01:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h01m46s">is that you also have to do such things as...</a>
00:01:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h01m51s">um...</a>
00:01:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h01m52s">Endeavor to stop deceiving yourself and other people, in every way you possibly can.</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h01m59s">And part of the reason for that is, that if you engage in</a>
00:01:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h02m03s">deception of any sort, you pathologize</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h02m07s">the structure of... well, first the structure of being.</a>
00:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h02m11s">But you could say you pathologize the structure of your nervous system - and then you can't trust its reports.</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h02m18s">So if you're going to rely on your nervous system's reports of meaningful engagement to guide your future activities,</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h02m25s">you better do everything you can to make sure,</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h02m27s">that you're not filling that nervous system with the kind of garbage that's going to make it malfunction,</a>
00:02:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h02m32s">and again, give you false reports.</a>
00:02:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h02m34s">So I think that moving towards meaningful engagement has to be associated with</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h02m40s">making truth your highest value, because otherwise you can't trust yourself as your own guide.</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h02m46s">I mean the Catholics had struggled with this for a long time from a theological perspective,</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h02m50s">because the catholic position - roughly speaking, is</a>
00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h02m53s">that human beings are so steeped in sin, that they can't trust their own instincts in relationship to good and evil,</a>
00:02:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h02m59s">and have to use the Church and the priesthood as an intermediary.</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h03m03s">And...</a>
00:03:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h03m05s">You know, you can obviously have an argument about that,</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h03m08s">and of course Protestants have historically done that,</a>
00:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h03m11s">but you've got to give the Catholics their due. It's like...</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h03m14s">People aren't pure by nature, and only trammeled in their vision by, you know, sociological impediments.</a>
00:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h03m20s">They're also corrupt beyond belief individually, and have to use society as a source of value.</a>
00:03:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h03m25s">So, if you're going to personalize your life in some sense,</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdA1vO2wYkE#t=00h03m31s">you better act in a manner, that makes you a reliable guide.</a>
