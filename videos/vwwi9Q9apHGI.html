<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h00m12s">Dostievsky, very good at it, he puts his characters in</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h00m16s">Very difficult moral situations, and it gives them a complete justification to pursue (my pursuit) ...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h01m03s">He wasn't very smart, and she was basically treating him like a slave, and she was terrible for him.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h01m20s">I will take her money. She does not do any good to him in any way at all. I will free her nephew who goes as a slave.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h01m25s">She has all these people entangled in her store's plans, all that happens is the world will become a better place!</a>
00:01:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h01m32s">The only thing stopping me is traditional moral cowardice.</a>
00:01:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h01m38s">And you know! Dostoevsky has a character in crime and punishment</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h01m41s">Clearing for days, hours, days and weeks,</a>
00:01:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h01m47s">Intense fantasies about this rationalization, about his attempt to justify</a>
00:01:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h01m54s">He placed himself outside the law, so that he could commit this act, and he said to himself</a>
00:01:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h02m00s">By the best of nihilistic arguments, the only thing is possible, that he prevents</a>
00:02:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h02m05s">It is an arbitrary domesticated moral concept (religion).</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h02m08s">So Dostoevsky explores how he committed the crime and later of course, all the gates of Hell open with a reason</a>
00:02:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h02m13s">Things do not necessarily turn out to be what you want them to be, however he gets away with it</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h02m17s">Well, he gets away with it</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h02m18s">Technically because no one knows that it was he who did it, but he does not escape his action with regard to his personal conscience.</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h02m24s">So the rest of the book explores that. Well, Dostoevsky, I think he was into crime and punishment even though he was</a>
00:02:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h02m30s">He clarifies the issue with a number of his books, he assesses a pivotal point, and this type of problem</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h02m36s">Which I think especially people who have not checked these matters</a>
00:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h02m43s">Literally with its philosophical path, they never wrestle with it, Dostoevsky said it bluntly.</a>
00:02:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h02m48s">If there is no God, then there is no supreme value, let's say that if there is no transcendent value, then you can do whatever you want.</a>
00:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h02m56s">And that's the question that is</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h02m58s">Checks it. And you see, that's why I own</a>
00:02:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h03m01s">So frustrated! Let's say about people like Sam Harris, that kind of radical atheist, because they seem to believe</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h03m06s">It is once human beings give up foundation</a>
00:03:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h03m10s">In sublime (sublime values), the path forward is a clear type</a>
00:03:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h03m16s">The automatic rationalist, as if I don't understand that !, they believe</a>
00:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h03m22s">this is</a>
00:03:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h03m23s">Is the rational path !, What the hell is irrational about taking exactly what I want from each of you whenever I want it</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h03m30s">At every possible moment, why is this irrational ?, and why is this</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h03m36s">More rational than our cooperation so that we can both get a good time from it, I just don't get it!</a>
00:03:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h03m42s">I mean, pathogenic madness is not rational !, there is nothing irrational about it!</a>
00:03:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h03m49s">It is a pure, naked personal interest, how is this irrational ?, I do not understand that.</a>
00:03:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h03m55s">Where is the path from rationality to an equal virtue!</a>
00:03:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h04m00s">Why the hell not everyone just take care of themselves,? And the devil take the hindmost</a>
00:04:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h04m04s">It is a completely coherent philosophy.</a>
00:04:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h04m07s">And it's really a philosophy that you can establish in the world with some kind of material success if you want to do that.</a>
00:04:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h04m12s">So I don't. I don't see, for me I think a universe that is people like Dawkins and Harris</a>
00:04:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h04m21s">They inhabit it, it is tightly conditioned (governed) by mythical presuppositions.</a>
00:04:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h04m27s">So they take for granted</a>
00:04:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h04m29s">The ethics that emanate from that as if they are given assumptions, taken for granted by rationality. And this, of course</a>
00:04:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h04m36s">What Nietzsche observed as Dostiowski, this is Nietzsche’s observation!</a>
00:04:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h04m40s">You just don't get it! The moral that you think is normative is a consequence</a>
00:04:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h04m46s">Of its nesting within this amazingly long history, many of it are expressed in</a>
00:04:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h04m53s">Mythical formations, you erase this !, You cannot maintain preemptive assumptions and just assume that they are rational intuitions.</a>
00:04:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h05m00s">Rational ..</a>
00:05:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h05m02s">To make a rational argument, you should start with an initial suggestion</a>
00:05:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h05m07s">Well, the suggestion upon which Western culture is based, is that there is a transcendence (the elevation of my values) in ethics,</a>
00:05:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h05m13s">You can say that this is a transcendent morality represented by God, that is okay.</a>
00:05:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h05m18s">You can even call this a diagnosis of morality (making ethics an entity or a person) if you want to</a>
00:05:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h05m21s">If you do not want to move to an abstract realm, I do not wish to argue about the existence of a god</a>
00:05:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h05m27s">I argue that the ethics guide</a>

00:05:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI#t=00h05m41s">Without foundation support (without making an argument for that).</a>
