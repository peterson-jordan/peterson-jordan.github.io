<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LqZdkkBDas#t=00h03m01s">His book “12 Rules for Living” is on the trail of bestsellers such as Steven Covey’s “7 Habits of Successful People”</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LqZdkkBDas#t=00h03m10s">The difference is that Peterson bases self-help like "take responsibility for yourself," "don't envy others."</a>
00:03:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LqZdkkBDas#t=00h03m17s">enriches with embellishments of psychology, philosophy, Jungian psychoanalysis, and biblical readings.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LqZdkkBDas#t=00h03m24s">He tells us a classic story: life is suffering, happiness is not enough to endure suffering, so you need a higher purpose in life.</a>
00:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LqZdkkBDas#t=00h03m32s">But I already knew that.</a>

00:03:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LqZdkkBDas#t=00h03m43s">probably because there are not enough alcoholics among them.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LqZdkkBDas#t=00h03m50s">so to many Peterson's ideas seem new and topical.</a>

00:03:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LqZdkkBDas#t=00h04m00s">and if Peterson can do it, go ahead.</a>
00:04:00</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LqZdkkBDas#t=00h04m10s">But there is a big problem.</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LqZdkkBDas#t=00h04m11s">The problem is that this self-help is just a Trojan horse for a reactionary political agenda.</a>
00:04:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LqZdkkBDas#t=00h04m18s">Peterson advocates an ethics of self-help that serves not only as a personal guide</a>
00:04:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LqZdkkBDas#t=00h04m21s">but also as a substitute for the progressive policies he characterizes as totalitarian and evil.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LqZdkkBDas#t=00h04m37s">Admittedly Peterson doesn’t use the term “progressive politics” because it doesn’t sound dangerous enough.</a>
00:04:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LqZdkkBDas#t=00h04m43s">His new more dangerous word is: POSTMODERN NEOMARXISM</a>
