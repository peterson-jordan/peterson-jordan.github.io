00:00:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h00m14s">in North America talks about Binswanger and Boss anymore maybe not</a>
00:00:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h00m18s">But I think their ideas are extremely interesting</a>
00:00:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h00m22s">And so I'm going to talk about them</a>
00:00:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h00m25s">They were influenced very much by Martin Heidegger</a>
00:00:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h00m29s">Who was one of the 20th century's greatest philosophers</a>
00:00:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h00m33s">I would say probably - This school of</a>
00:00:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h00m38s">This part of the phenomenological school</a>
00:00:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h00m40s">was more influenced directly by a philosopher than any other school.</a>
00:00:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h00m43s">And just to reiterate because you might keep wondering why</a>
00:00:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h00m48s">I discuss so many philosophers in this course</a>
00:00:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h00m51s">It's because</a>
00:00:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h00m54s">Clinical Psychology in particular is not strictly a scientific enterprise</a>
00:00:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h00m59s">It's because it's oriented towards values as far as I can tell</a>
00:00:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h01m05s">And I don't see that there is any way of getting around that</a>
00:01:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h01m08s">and that because what you are trying to do as a clinical psychologist</a>
00:01:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h01m11s">and perhaps what you're trying to do with your own life  is to figure out how to live properly</a>
00:01:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h01m15s">Now you can construe that as the absence of illness</a>
00:01:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h01m18s">Which is - That's about as close as you get to a scientific model of living well</a>
00:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h01m24s">So you don't have any illnesses</a>
00:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h01m26s">But even the idea of illness is an idea that's not precisely scientific</a>
00:01:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h01m30s">It's an amalgam of scientific concepts and ethical concepts</a>
00:01:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h01m35s">so</a>
00:01:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h01m36s">There is no escaping it and if you're in the domain of ethics or values</a>
00:01:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h01m40s">Then you're in what is more or less a philosophical domain</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h01m43s">But also if you're a scientist - if you're a scientist who is interested in personality</a>
00:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h01m49s">It's also something you have to grapple with conceptually</a>
00:01:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h01m51s">Because people live within an ethic and the ethic structures their perceptions</a>
00:01:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h01m55s">And so even to study human beings as objects</a>
00:01:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h01m58s">You still have to take into account they ensconce themselves within a value system</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h02m03s">and you have to understand what that means</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h02m05s">So for me it's easier and more straightforward just to get right to the root of matter to begin with</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h02m10s">and these people also had insanely interesting ideas</a>
00:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h02m12s">They're really useful to know</a>
00:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h02m14s">And so this, I would say maybe these</a>
00:02:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h02m17s">The philosophy that underpins this might be the most complex of all the philosophies</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h02m21s">That we're going to discuss</a>
00:02:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h02m25s">And that's really saying something because there is no shortage of complexities say in Jung</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h02m29s">And it's very difficult to portray what these people were up to</a>
00:02:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h02m34s">I started by telling you, when we discussed Rogers a little bit</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h02m38s">That the phenomenologists were interested in the fact that people live within a self-defined perceptual world</a>
00:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h02m47s">That might be one way of thinking about it</a>
00:02:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h02m52s">Part of the way to start to conceptualize what that means is to consider for a moment</a>
00:02:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h02m58s">just consider for a moment how many things there are in this room that you might look at</a>
00:02:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h03m03s">and the answer to that is there's an infinite number of them</a>
00:03:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h03m06s">Depending on how you're going to scale your perceptions</a>
00:03:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h03m08s">You could spend, if you were a painter, you could spend a month painting that tile</a>
00:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h03m13s">Painting a representation of that tile because it's infinitely complex</a>
00:03:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h03m17s">To get the colors right, to get the patterns right, there's no end to it really</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h03m21s">Because to make a representation that was accurate</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h03m24s">It would have to be as detailed as the thing itself and it's crazily detailed</a>
00:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h03m29s">But you don't concentrate on that sort of thing</a>
00:03:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h03m30s">So you think, you're surrounded by an infinite number of potential things to apprehend</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h03m35s">But that isn't the world you live in</a>
00:03:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h03m37s">The world you live in is a very very constrained subset of those things</a>
00:03:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h03m42s">And part of the question is then: what's the nature of that constrained subset</a>
00:03:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h03m46s">That's what you inhabit that's what makes up your experience</a>
00:03:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h03m49s">And also how is it related to the infinitely complex objects that are around you</a>
00:03:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h03m55s">And that's really what these people were trying to figure out.</a>
00:03:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h03m58s">So you're in this perceptual frame, that's one way of thinking about it.</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h04m02s">That's the Dasein, by the way</a>
00:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h04m04s">That's the existential frame or the phenomenological frame</a>
00:04:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h04m08s">Because you can't think about it merely as perception</a>
00:04:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h04m10s">Because it contains also, all of the things you experience subjectively</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h04m14s">The emotions and the Qualia that</a>
00:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h04m18s">You know Qualia is an element of being</a>
00:04:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h04m21s">that say philosophers or scientists of consciouness have a particularly difficult time with.</a>
00:04:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h04m26s">And it's like - it's the quality of pain which doesn't seem reducible to a set of  objective facts</a>
00:04:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h04m30s">Or the quality of color, or the quality of beauty, or the quality of love, or the quality of sorrow</a>
00:04:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h04m36s">Those things seem irreducible to some degree in and of themselves</a>
00:04:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h04m39s">Like what is pain made of? It doesn't even seem like a reasonable question.</a>
00:04:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h04m43s">I mean you can say, how do you decompose the neurological circuits that are involved in the experience of pain? Fine.</a>
00:04:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h04m51s">But to ask what pain consists of or is composed of or what beauty is composed of, or love.</a>
00:04:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h04m57s">Seems to be -  There is something wrong with the formulation of that question</a>
00:04:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h05m01s">Because those things sort of manifest them self as raw facts of existence</a>
00:05:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h05m06s">And so they're constituent elements of this - of your field of experience</a>
00:05:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h05m10s">Your phenomenological frame or this Dasein</a>
00:05:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h05m14s">Which is the way that Heidegger conceptualized it.</a>
00:05:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h05m18s">That's being there with you at the center of your what? Your realm of experience</a>
00:05:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h05m28s">Now here's some characteristics of the Dasein</a>
00:05:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h05m31s">The thing that makes up you</a>
00:05:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h05m34s">The past and the present are implicit in it</a>
00:05:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h05m37s">What does that mean?</a>
00:05:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h05m39s">Well, say you have a particular emotional response to something, maybe it's a negative emotional response.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h05m46s">And you see this very frequently with arguments with people</a>
00:05:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h05m49s">You're having an argument with someone you love. Like a family member, that's a good example</a>
00:05:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h05m52s">So lets say it's the same damn fight you've had with your mother 50 times</a>
00:05:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h05m57s">Okay that's interesting because what it means is that</a>
00:05:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h06m00s">All of those 50 times you've fought with your mother are implicit in this fight</a>
00:06:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h06m05s">So althought it's taking place right here and now, the past has shaped it</a>
00:06:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h06m10s">And if you wanted to investigate the fight completely</a>
00:06:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h06m14s">You'd have to get to the bottom of that entire train of interactions you've had with your mother</a>
00:06:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h06m18s">So it's implicit in your current experience that's one way of thinking about it</a>
00:06:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h06m24s">But the future is implicit in it too because</a>
00:06:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h06m27s">What you're doing right now, it's as if the future is folded up in what you're experiencing right now and it unfolds as you interact with it</a>
00:06:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h06m34s">And so the reason it's conditional to some degree on you and your past is because</a>
00:06:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h06m40s">it's your past and you that are determining the actions that you undertake right now that determine how the future is going to unfold around you</a>
00:06:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h06m47s">Now not completely obviously because you don't have complete control over how things unfold</a>
00:06:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h06m54s">But you seem to have some ability to determine how things unfold</a>
00:06:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h06m59s">So one of the ways I've sort of conceptualized the phenomenological viewpoint</a>
00:06:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h07m04s">This is one way of thinking about it I believe is that</a>
00:07:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h07m06s">Instead of thinking - It does mean you have to reconceptualize your idea of objects</a>
00:07:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h07m12s">Like an object seems like a unidimensional thing in some sense. It's an object.</a>
00:07:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h07m16s">But most of the things people interact with aren't like that at all</a>
00:07:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h07m19s">So like here's an example</a>
00:07:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h07m22s">Let's say you have</a>
00:07:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h07m24s">Let's say you get</a>
00:07:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h07m26s">You're writing the MCAT, you want to go to medical school</a>
00:07:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h07m28s">You've written the MCAT, you get the envelope in the mail, it tells you what your score is</a>
00:07:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h07m32s">You hold the envelope, what are you holding?</a>
00:07:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h07m36s">Well if you think about it from an objective perspective, it's an envelope</a>
00:07:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h07m38s">Who cares? It's just a little piece of paper right?</a>
00:07:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h07m41s">It's a rectangle of paper</a>
00:07:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h07m44s">But that isn't what you're holding at all</a>
00:07:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h07m46s">That's not what that thing is, that's how you see it. But it's not what it is at all and you know that. Your body knows that</a>
00:07:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h07m53s">Because you're shaking. Well, what are you scared of? The envelope?</a>
00:07:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h07m57s">Well the fact that you see it as an envelope is only an indication of just how narrow your perceptions actually are.</a>
00:07:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h08m05s">Because it's a portal.</a>
00:08:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h08m07s">Right? it's a portal through which you are going to walk into one of two worlds</a>
00:08:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h08m11s">One in which you're in medical school and the other in which you're not</a>
00:08:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h08m15s">And it also actually contains the past</a>
00:08:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h08m17s">Which is really strange because you think, well you already know what the past is. No you don't.</a>
00:08:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h08m22s">Whatever that score is in there determines what your past was and you know that too.</a>
00:08:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h08m28s">You go watch a movie and a bunch of things happen in the movie and then something twisted happens at the end  and all the sudden (trilling)</a>
00:08:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h08m33s">Everything that you thought about the movie was wrong</a>
00:08:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h08m36s">and a whole new past for the movie pops into being</a>
00:08:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h08m39s">Well, are you a pre-med student? A valid pre-med student? Well the score will determine whether or not you were.</a>
00:08:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h08m47s">Very strange, very strange</a>
00:08:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h08m49s">Because you think of the past as fixed</a>
00:08:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h08m51s">You know? And you think of the things you're interacting with as the things that you see and they're not</a>
00:08:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h08m57s">And you're body is smarter than that, way smarter than that. Because it responds to, you could say</a>
00:08:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h09m02s">And this is sort of a Rogerian perspective, your body is more likely to respond to what the thing actually is, than how it is that you see it.</a>
00:09:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h09m09s">Okay so, the past is implicit in the current being</a>
00:09:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h09m13s">and the future is implicit in the current being</a>
00:09:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h09m16s">And so the past and the future sort of folded up inside it</a>
00:09:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h09m20s">And you can unfold them and take a look at them</a>
00:09:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h09m29s">Now, here's the next thing</a>
00:09:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h09m31s">So, from a classic scientific perspective,</a>
00:09:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h09m35s">There's the world of independently existing objects and there's the world of subjects</a>
00:09:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h09m39s">And the subject is really in a secondary relationship to the object</a>
00:09:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h09m44s">Because the objective world is what's real</a>
00:09:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h09m45s">But one of the things that the phenomenologists were concerned about that</a>
00:09:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h09m51s">Is that, well you run into this problem again of exactly how it is that you define the object</a>
00:09:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h09m57s">Because, just as the envelope with the scores in it can't be reduced to the paper,</a>
00:09:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h10m06s">So the object that you're interacting with only reveals what it is as a consequence of the way that you interact with it</a>
00:10:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h10m14s">So for example if you take a complex object like another person</a>
00:10:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h10m18s">It's like well, what is it that you are. Well a huge part of that is going to depend on exactly how I interact with you</a>
00:10:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h10m24s">Because you could be a raging beast if I interacted with you one way</a>
00:10:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h10m28s">and you could be a perfectly, you know, cooperative entity that was very pleasant if I interacted with you another way</a>
00:10:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h10m35s">And so partly what's happening - you can think of what you're interacting with as something that's really multi-faceted. Truly multi-faceted</a>
00:10:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h10m43s">And you say, well you're trying to determine what it is.</a>
00:10:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h10m47s">But the problem is that what it is manifests itself only in accordance with how you behave towards it</a>
00:10:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h10m52s">And it's actually the case with even objects that you reduce right down to their constituent elements</a>
00:10:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h10m59s">So you might say like lets talk about subatomic particles. Hypothetically, the most objective thing there is</a>
00:10:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h11m04s">Well it turns out that whether they're a wave or a particle depends on the way you set up the experiment</a>
00:11:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h11m10s">Now I don't want to make quantum analogies but what I'm saying is that the object is a very very complicated thing</a>
00:11:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h11m16s">And so even defining what it is means you have to adopt a frame of reference with regards to it</a>
00:11:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h11m21s">And you undertake only some procedures and not others</a>
00:11:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h11m25s">So, when you're defining an object even scientifically you actually don't define the object.</a>
00:11:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h11m29s">What you say is here is a multi-dimensional entity if you approach it in this manner, that's the procedure, right? The methods.</a>
00:11:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h11m37s">If you approach it in that manner, it will manifest that set of traits</a>
00:11:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h11m41s">But the problem is, is that there's all sorts of other traits that it could manifest just as well</a>
00:11:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h11m45s">If you treated it a different way</a>
00:11:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h11m47s">And so the object itself is not something that - it's not something easily reducible to a single set of properties</a>
00:11:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h11m55s">I was talking to one of my students yesterday, he had a pretty smart thing to say about images.</a>
00:11:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h12m00s">We were talking about deep images you know the sorts that you might see in a really high quality museum</a>
00:12:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h12m05s">So maybe they're I don't know 15th century or 16th century renaissance  masterpieces</a>
00:12:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h12m12s">They're inexhaustible to some degree</a>
00:12:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h12m14s">Which is why they're in museums and people go look at them you know decade after decade</a>
00:12:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h12m19s">And it's partly because</a>
00:12:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h12m22s">Every time you look at them you're different</a>
00:12:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h12m24s">You go in one week, you look at it, you see something. You go in the next week, you look at it and you see something else.</a>
00:12:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h12m29s">Well it's partly because</a>
00:12:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h12m31s">You're bringing something entirely different to the situation</a>
00:12:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h12m35s">and the image is complicated enough to allow it to reflect something new to you depening on the stance you take in relationship to it</a>
00:12:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h12m43s">And lots of things are like that</a>
00:12:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h12m46s">A book you read when you were sixteen is going to be an entirely different book when you read it when you're 35</a>
00:12:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h12m50s">Say well the book's the same. It's like, it depends on how you define the book</a>
00:12:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h12m55s">Because it isn't even obvious where the book is exactly</a>
00:12:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h12m58s">Well it's on my shelf in the library</a>
00:12:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h13m00s">It's like no, that's a chunk of paper that's on your shelf in the library</a>
00:13:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h13m05s">Where exactly the book is, that's a much more difficult question to consider</a>
00:13:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h13m10s">So it depends on how you define the book</a>
00:13:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h13m13s">So without a subject, nothing at all would exist to confront objects and to imagine them as such</a>
00:13:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h13m19s">True this implies that every object</a>
00:13:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h13m21s">Everything objective in being merely objectified by the subject is the most subjective thing possible</a>
00:13:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h13m28s">Well you also know this again when you're in an argument with someone</a>
00:13:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h13m30s">"it's you"</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h13m33s">It's like, you don't know</a>
00:13:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h13m35s">Are you being biased? Are you looking at the situation incorrectly?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h13m39s">The person you're arguing with trying to convince you that it's your problem</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h13m43s">You think "no you made me angry"</a>
00:13:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h13m46s">It's like hmm an interesting statement you know? as if you could do that</a>
00:13:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h13m51s">But it does seem that way, you were being provocative</a>
00:13:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h13m54s">"Well you're just too sensitive"</a>
00:13:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h13m56s">"hmm how are we going to settle that?"</a>
00:13:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h13m58s">Well it's a continual argument and that again has to do with the crazy entangled dynamic between subjective perception and objective perception</a>
00:13:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h14m13s">I've showed you this before and I actually think this is a pretty good</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h14m20s">And this is a complicated little diagram</a>
00:14:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h14m22s">Although the diagram itself is quite simple</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h14m30s">You need to narrow down your world</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h14m32s">and what you're doing is narrowing it down from lets say an infinite set of possibilities</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h14m37s">To a finite set of manageable possibilities</a>
00:14:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h14m39s">and you do that a bunch of ways</a>
00:14:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h14m41s">Partly - merely - you can't your senses aren't acute enough to detect everything.</a>
00:14:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h14m46s">So pure stupidity in some sense stops you from being absolutely overwhelmed</a>
00:14:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h14m52s">You don't have eyes in the back of your head for example so you don't have to worry about all those things you're not looking at behind you</a>
00:14:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h14m57s">But then it's far more than that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h14m59s">You just can't handle that full complexity so there's a continual narrowing process</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h15m04s">And then you exist inside that narrowed reality</a>
00:15:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h15m06s">Like if I look at you like that</a>
00:15:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h15m09s">There's not a hell of a lot of difference between that looking at you like that</a>
00:15:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h15m13s">Like I can't really see these people. I can tell they're people, that's all</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h15m17s">I can see your face</a>

00:15:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h15m28s">Well what's that space - what does that space you inhabit consist of</a>
00:15:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h15m33s">Well that's Dasein that space that you inhabit and so we can say</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h15m36s">It's something like this</a>
00:15:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h15m38s">You have implicit in that perception a sense of where you are and what you are doing right now</a>
00:15:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h15m43s">it's in the perception</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h15m44s">and then in the perception as well is what you're aiming at</a>
00:15:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h15m48s">Because you're not just sitting here passively or you'd be asleep or you'd be unconscious</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h15m52s">You're sitting here doing nothing</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h15m55s">You know, physically</a>
00:15:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h15m56s">But you have an aim in mind and the aim is what you're pointing your eyes at</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h16m00s">The aim is what's structuring your perceptions</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h16m10s">That's the revelation of the world</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h16m15s">So it's not a drive, it's not a goal</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h16m18s">it's not a motivation, it's more than that. It's all of that at once.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h16m23s">That's sort of what your personality is</a>
00:16:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h16m25s">You see the phenomenologists don't really think about personality</a>
00:16:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h16m28s">They think about the manifestation of your reality</a>
00:16:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h16m32s">It's not exactly your personality</a>
00:16:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h16m34s">It's that you're the center of a reality and you constitute that reality</a>
00:16:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h16m39s">But all of your elements of experience constitute that reality and so it's simplest element is something like</a>
00:16:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h16m44s">Where you are and where you're going and the embodied actions you undertake to relate those two things</a>
00:16:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h16m52s">Which would include your eye movements because of course perception is an active phenomena</a>
00:16:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h16m57s">You are shaking your eyes back and forth unbelievable rapidly</a>
00:16:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h17m00s">Otherwise, if you can make your eyes stand still, which you can do with great concentration</a>
00:17:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h17m05s">Everything will black out</a>
00:17:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h17m07s">Because you have to move your eyes back and forth so the light hits different cells cause the cells get exhausted</a>
00:17:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h17m14s">And then they stop reporting. So you're just whipping your eyes back and forth in a micro-way constantly</a>
00:17:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h17m21s">And as well as moving them around voluntarily and involuntarily</a>
00:17:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h17m25s">So even perception is a lot more like feeling things out with your fingers</a>
00:17:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h17m29s">Even when you're using your ears or your eyes</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h17m31s">It's very active, there's no passive perception</a>
00:17:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h17m34s">it's a motor act to perceive</a>
00:17:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h17m36s">and so your motor act is determined by your hierarchy of values that's one way of looking at it</a>
00:17:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h17m40s">So another way of thinking about it is that's how the past and future are implicit in it</a>
00:17:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h17m46s">Your very active perception is determined by your entire value structure</a>
00:17:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h17m50s">So</a>
00:17:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h17m51s">It's implicit inside of it, it's folded up inside of it</a>
00:17:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h17m54s">You can tell that too because if something violates it</a>
00:17:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h17m57s">Again, maybe an argument with someone</a>
00:17:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h17m59s">It's good to think about people as the thing you interact with the most as the canonical object</a>
00:17:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h18m05s">Cause they're so damn complicated and they get in the way all the time and when someone gets in the way of what you're doing</a>
00:18:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h18m10s">You know, it isn't obvious what they're interfering with</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h18m13s">It might be the little micro-routine that you're undertaking right now</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h18m22s">Okay so what exactly are they getting in the way of?</a>
00:18:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h18m26s">Well</a>
00:18:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h18m28s">They're certainly getting in the way of your expectations of having a nice emotional time for the next hour</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h18m35s">But you have no idea how indicative that is of some serious flaw</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h18m51s">but it's more - it's not the same conceptualization. It's another way of looking at the same phenomena</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h19m07s">Taken to task often because he turned out to be tangled up with the Nazis more than he should've been</a>
00:19:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h19m13s">And Husserl, that's Edmund Husserl, who was actually if I remember correctly was Martin Heidegger's teacher</a>
00:19:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h19m19s">That's Ludwig Binswanger - and they were</a>
00:19:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h19m21s">Both of these two people were influenced both by Freud and Jung</a>
00:19:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h19m26s">Okay so here is one of Binswanger's claims</a>
00:19:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h19m29s">I love this claim it's such a cool idea</a>
00:19:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h19m31s">And I think there is neurological support for it. Neuropsychological support</a>
00:19:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h19m34s">What we perceive are "first and foremost" not impressions of taste, tone, smell or touch</a>
00:19:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h19m41s">Not even in things or objects, but meanings</a>
00:19:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h19m43s">Well that's an interesting idea</a>
00:19:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h19m45s">Because</a>
00:19:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h19m48s">You know it's been said that every person in an unconscious exponent of some great philosopher's presuppositions</a>
00:19:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h19m54s">Well, mostly the way you think about the way you perceive is that there are objects in the world</a>
00:19:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h19m59s">You see the objects</a>
00:19:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h20m00s">You think about the objects, you evaluate the objects</a>
00:20:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h20m03s">You decide how to act on the objects, and then you act</a>
00:20:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h20m06s">Right? it's from</a>
00:20:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h20m08s">Object, sense, perception, emotion, cognition, action</a>
00:20:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h20m12s">That's wrong. That isn't how it works</a>
00:20:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h20m15s">It's partly not the way it works because</a>
00:20:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h20m18s">You're actually - the way that you interact with the world exists at multiple levels</a>
00:20:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h20m22s">So for example</a>
00:20:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h20m23s">You have reflexes so if I</a>
00:20:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h20m26s">If I poke you hard, you'll react like that. You'll jerk back</a>
00:20:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h20m32s">And that, you do that without thinking</a>
00:20:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h20m33s">That's part of a neurological circuit that's very deeply embedded and that's virtually automatic</a>
00:20:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h20m40s">It's reflexive. It doesn't require conscious perception at all</a>
00:20:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h20m43s">It's too slow for starters</a>
00:20:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h20m45s">And so you have - there's multiple levels of you interacting with the world.</a>
00:20:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h20m50s">And at one level, you're seeing objects, you're thinking about them, you're planning what to do</a>
00:20:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h20m54s">But you're doing all sorts of other things that are way faster than that and other things that are way slower at the same time.</a>
00:20:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h21m00s">Now what Binswanger claims</a>
00:21:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h21m03s">Is that what you see in the world are meanings</a>
00:21:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h21m07s">So it's the meaning detection first and the object recognition second</a>
00:21:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h21m12s">Now that's a hell of a claim, that is</a>
00:21:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h21m14s">But there's definitely levels of your nervous system</a>
00:21:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h21m16s">That operate in that manner</a>
00:21:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h21m18s">So for example</a>
00:21:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h21m19s">Here's a good example, people have blind sight</a>
00:21:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h21m22s">There visual cortex is damaged they can't see objects</a>
00:21:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h21m26s">So they think they're blind</a>
00:21:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h21m27s">But if you show them an angry face, they'll manifest a change in the skin conductants, They'll orient</a>
00:21:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h21m34s">And it means that the eyes are still mapping the face onto the amygdala</a>
00:21:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h21m39s">And the amygdala is mapping the pattern onto the body, no object perception</a>
00:21:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h21m43s">Pattern</a>
00:21:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h21m46s">No object perception</a>
00:21:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h21m48s">And so the meaning is what's being perceived first and foremost</a>
00:21:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h21m53s">And you have to perceive meanings first because you actually want to stay alive</a>
00:21:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h21m57s">That's the trick</a>
00:21:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h21m58s">So the world is full of these things that have meanings to you that are relevant to your survival</a>
00:21:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h22m04s">And what you're perceiving first is the relevance of the pattern to your survival</a>
00:22:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h22m09s">And the idea that you can conceptualize that as a set of objects</a>
00:22:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h22m12s">Well first of all, that's a pretty new idea</a>
00:22:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h22m15s">Technically speaking, right? Because</a>
00:22:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h22m17s">Technically speaking we didn't really start to conceive the world as subject in an objective world until we really formalized science</a>
00:22:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h22m25s">Now science was implicit long before it became explicit</a>
00:22:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h22m29s">But it didn't become explicit until about 500 years ago</a>
00:22:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h22m32s">So you react to meanings</a>
00:22:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h22m34s">So here's an example</a>
00:22:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h22m36s">Babies</a>
00:22:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h22m37s">if you</a>
00:22:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h22m38s">If you have two surfaces and you put a piece of glass between them</a>
00:22:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h22m41s">You know, they're elevated</a>
00:22:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h22m43s">And you put an 8 month year old baby on the one surface so they can crawl</a>
00:22:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h22m48s">It won't crawl across the space</a>
00:22:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h22m51s">And you might say it sees a hole and won't crawl across it</a>
00:22:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h22m56s">But that isn't what it sees. It sees a place to fall off</a>
00:22:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h22m59s">Direct, that's direct perception</a>
00:22:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h23m02s">So when I see this for example</a>
00:23:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h23m04s">My eyes see that as a pattern</a>
00:23:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h23m07s">That pattern's on my retina it's propagated through my optic nerve</a>
00:23:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h23m11s">It's propagated into my brain, it's propagated onto my motor cortex</a>
00:23:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h23m15s">And the propagation is</a>
00:23:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h23m17s">This</a>
00:23:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h23m18s">That</a>
00:23:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h23m20s">Right? So I can pick it up</a>
00:23:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h23m22s">And as soon as - when I look at that this is implicit</a>
00:23:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h23m26s">That's implicit in the perception</a>
00:23:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h23m28s">You think well why do you see that at the size and resolution you see it at?</a>
00:23:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h23m32s">That's why</a>
00:23:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h23m33s">So the fact that you see it that way has this implicit in it</a>
00:23:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h23m36s">It isn't that you see the object and match your hand to it</a>
00:23:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h23m39s">It's that matching your hand to it is part of the perception of the object</a>
00:23:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h23m43s">It's what gives the object meaning</a>
00:23:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h23m45s">And so you see actually you perceive the meaning of the object</a>
00:23:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h23m48s">It's part of the perception</a>
00:23:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h23m50s">And you can't not see the meaning of the object</a>
00:23:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h23m53s">Well if you're a scientist you can sort of separate out the object from its meaning</a>
00:23:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h23m58s">That's actually what science does</a>
00:23:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h24m00s">It tears the object away from its meaning</a>
00:24:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h24m03s">And then of course there is nothing meaningful left</a>
00:24:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h24m05s">So science ends up value free. But that's because the meaning has been torn out of it</a>
00:24:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h24m10s">Now there's technical reasons for doing that</a>
00:24:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h24m11s">But Binswanger's point is don't kid yourself you see the meaning first. Here's an example</a>
00:24:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h24m16s">You watch the trade towers fall</a>
00:24:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h24m19s">What did you see?</a>
00:24:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h24m22s">Well you could say you saw the towers fall</a>
00:24:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h24m24s">It's like why are you in shock for two days afterwards then?</a>
00:24:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h24m27s">Well because what are the towers exactly?</a>
00:24:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h24m31s">As long as they're standing and operating, they're towers.</a>
00:24:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h24m34s">As soon as they fall, God only knows what they are</a>
00:24:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h24m37s">Maybe they're the beginning of the next war</a>
00:24:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h24m40s">You know? Who knows what they are?</a>
00:24:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h24m43s">And so everyone was in shock for three days</a>
00:24:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h24m45s">Because what they saw was the indeterminate meaning of that event</a>
00:24:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h24m50s">And it opened all sorts of gateways</a>
00:24:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h24m52s">It's like well, the towers fell, there's gateways open everywhere.</a>
00:24:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h24m56s">We don't know what's going on. We don't know what's going to happen next. We don't know where we are</a>
00:24:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h25m00s">And that's direct perception mapped onto your body. Bang, you're in shock</a>
00:25:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h25m04s">You see the meaning first</a>
00:25:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h25m05s">And well you constrain it down to well why are you so upset?</a>
00:25:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h25m09s">Well the towers fell</a>
00:25:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h25m10s">It's like that's the best you can do for a verbal utterance</a>
00:25:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h25m13s">It's what your perceptual systems reported to you</a>
00:25:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h25m15s">But God only knows what happened</a>
00:25:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h25m18s">We still don't really know what it meant that they fell</a>
00:25:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h25m22s">Now most things have put themselves back together but</a>
00:25:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h25m28s">And then you think well what does it mean?</a>
00:25:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h25m30s">What does it mean that what you see first is the meaning?</a>
00:25:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h25m33s">and that's a really tricky question because you might say well</a>
00:25:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h25m36s">That's when you get back to the problem of what constitutes real</a>
00:25:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h25m40s">So I could say well you've evolved to see the meaning</a>
00:25:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h25m45s">Well then we might ask</a>
00:25:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h25m46s">Well if you've evoled to see the meaning and that's kept you alive</a>
00:25:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h25m49s">Is there anything more real than the meaning?</a>
00:25:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h25m52s">Because somebody who is a materialist would say "well no, the object is more real"</a>
00:25:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h25m55s">It's like no, it depends on how you define real</a>
00:25:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h25m58s">It might be that the most real thing about the visual cliff is that that's a falling off place</a>
00:25:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h26m03s">And that its secondary description as a you know an object</a>
00:26:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h26m06s">A hole or something like that</a>
00:26:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h26m08s">That's something you paint over the top of the primary reality</a>
00:26:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h26m12s">And so,</a>
00:26:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h26m16s">Well here's a practical application of it or at least one of the things I think is practical</a>
00:26:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h26m20s">You know, you can have experiences that differ in their, lets call it, high quality meaning</a>
00:26:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h26m26s">You know so you get engaged and engrossed in something and you're happy about that</a>
00:26:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h26m29s">It's not that you're happy</a>
00:26:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h26m30s">It's that you're engaged and engrossed in it, you would do it again</a>
00:26:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h26m33s">Even though it might take effort</a>
00:26:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h26m35s">You can tell that where you are is meaningful</a>
00:26:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h26m38s">Well I think what happens in that situation is that</a>
00:26:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h26m42s">You're in a Piagetian place</a>
00:26:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h26m44s">Where many of the games that you're playing are stacked sort of isomorphically on top of one another</a>
00:26:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h26m49s">And the experience of meaning is the fact that you're playing a small game properly</a>
00:26:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h26m54s">Nested inside a larger game, you're playing it properly</a>
00:26:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h26m57s"> too, etc all the way out</a>
00:26:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h27m01s">Past is balanced, future is balanced everything is stacked up</a>
00:27:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h27m05s">And there's a report coming from your being telling you that, that's why you're engaged</a>
00:27:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h27m11s">You might say well maybe that's real. Maybe it's more real than anything else</a>
00:27:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h27m15s">That's a strange thing because if you think that meaning is separate and secondary from the real objective world</a>
00:27:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h27m21s">Then the reality is the object</a>
00:27:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h27m24s">But it isn't obvious that the reality is the object</a>
00:27:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h27m27s">It's certainly not how we act</a>
00:27:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h27m30s">It's not how we perceive</a>
00:27:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h27m33s">And so</a>
00:27:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h27m35s">Did we evolve to perceive reality? It depends on what you mean by perceive</a>
00:27:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h27m39s">Perceive might mean did we evolve mechanisms that allowed us to survive in the face of that reality. Yes.</a>
00:27:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h27m47s">Is that whats real? What enables you to survive in the face of reality?</a>
00:27:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h27m51s">It's a definition</a>
00:27:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h27m53s">It's a perfectly reasonable definition unless you can come up with a better one</a>
00:27:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h27m57s">Meanings are primary</a>
00:27:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h28m00s">Now that brings up a strange issue</a>
00:28:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h28m03s">So what determines the meaning of what it is you're perceiving</a>
00:28:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h28m06s">Well this is where Binswanger and Boss disagree</a>
00:28:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h28m11s">Binswanger says</a>
00:28:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h28m12s">It's the a-priori ontological structure. The world design, or matrix of meaning</a>
00:28:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h28m18s">Okay so what does that mean?</a>
00:28:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h28m20s">Well, you have a particular history. Biological and cultural and individual</a>
00:28:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h28m25s">And you're viewing the world through the lense of that set of particularities</a>
00:28:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h28m31s">So it's almost if you are behind a curtain and the curtain has certain hoels in it</a>
00:28:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h28m36s">And you can see through the wholes in the curtain</a>
00:28:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h28m39s">but the curtain is your construction so the curtain with the holes determines what you see</a>
00:28:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h28m45s">Well, Boss would say no it's the opposite in a very strange thing</a>
00:28:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h28m50s">The meaning of the world manifests itself to you more or less of its own accord</a>
00:28:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h28m55s">And</a>
00:28:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h28m57s">It's a tougher one to explain</a>
00:28:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h29m01s">Disclosure of meaning: Boss the revelation of the object</a>
00:29:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h29m04s">The emergence of the phenomena: the numinous</a>
00:29:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h29m07s">The very word phenomena is derived from phainesthai</a>
00:29:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h29m11s">To shine forth, to appear,  to unveil itself, to come out of concealment or darkness</a>
00:29:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h29m15s">Okay here's an example you see someone beautiful</a>
00:29:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h29m19s">Is it your perception</a>
00:29:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h29m22s">is it your perception or does the beauty exist?</a>
00:29:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h29m25s">That's the difference between Binswanger and Boss</a>
00:29:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h29m28s">Cause Binswanger would say well the reason that thing appears to you as beautiful is because of the way you're filtering it</a>
00:29:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h29m34s">And Boss would say no</a>
00:29:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h29m36s">The beauty inheres in the object itself and manifests itself. It shines forth</a>
00:29:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h29m42s">And so I really like this concept this concept of phenomena</a>
00:29:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h29m46s">That's why they're phenomenologists</a>
00:29:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h29m47s">phainesthai means to shine forth</a>
00:29:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h29m49s">From the phenomenological perspective you pursue those things that shine forth</a>
00:29:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h29m55s">Now you remember this is kind of a parallel idea</a>
00:29:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h30m00s">I suppose it's a parallel of Jungian ideas</a>
00:30:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h30m03s">You remember in Harry Potter that when they're playing Quidditch he's always chasing the snitch?</a>
00:30:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h30m07s">And you remember how, if I've got this correctly,</a>
00:30:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h30m10s">Quidditch is basically two games at the same time right? There's the standard game and there's the game that the seekers play</a>
00:30:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h30m16s">Yes? I've got that right?</a>
00:30:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h30m18s">What happens if the seeker gets the snitch?</a>
00:30:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h30m20s">Games over right? They win</a>
00:30:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h30m23s">Very interesting. She has a brilliant imagination that woman, Rowling</a>
00:30:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h30m28s">So the idea is that in every game there's two games going on at the same time. There's the ordinary game</a>
00:30:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h30m32s">And there's the game that the seekers play and the seekers chase the thing that shines at them</a>
00:30:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h30m37s">And that's what that little thing is the snitch. It's a round circle with wings.</a>

00:30:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h30m59s">And you were trying to figure out what was common among all the things that made you curious</a>
00:30:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h31m04s">That thing that Harry Potter's chasing, that's a symbol of that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h31m07s">It's golden like the sun, it flits around and attracts your attention and it's always moving</a>
00:31:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h31m12s">And if you're seeking, you chase it.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h31m15s">So that's the phenomenological idea, that's the disclosure of meaning</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h31m23s">Is it calling to you? Or is it something that you're interpreting?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h31m28s">Well I would say it's both</a>
00:31:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h31m29s">I think that's the way to resolve this puzzle</a>
00:31:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h31m33s">It's that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h31m44s">But by the same token the thing that's being perceived</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h31m47s">Also shines forth with its own potential manifestation</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h31m51s">And you need to think of it both ways at the same time</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h31m54s">But the curiosity issue is a really fascinating one</a>
00:31:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h31m57s">Because curiosity pulls you forward</a>
00:31:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h32m00s">It's not random</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h32m07s">If your curiosity is random, you're schizophrenic</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h32m09s">And I mean that technically</a>
00:32:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h32m11s">Because one of the things that happens to schziphrenics is that the mechanisms that establish relevance become pathologized</a>
00:32:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h32m18s">And they see meaning everywhere, randomly</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h32m20s">And that's partly why they generate delusions</a>
00:32:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h32m22s">Because the incoherent manifestation of meaning calls out for a representation</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h32m32s">So you're curious and something pulls you forward</a>
00:32:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h32m35s">Well you can interact with the curiosity  and you can follow it but you can't really direct it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h32m40s">The question is where is it taking you?</a>
00:32:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h32m43s">So that little ball, that was a manifestation</a>

00:33:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h33m03s">Well to wherever it wants to take you</a>
00:33:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h33m06s">Well that's a Jungian idea as well</a>
00:33:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h33m07s">Is that your curiosity is like the manifestation of your self to the ego</a>
00:33:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h33m13s">Right? It's the thing that you could be in the future calling you forward</a>
00:33:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h33m18s">Something like that</a>
00:33:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h33m20s">Very strange idea</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h33m22s">Very interesting. See when you start to understand</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h33m25s">That you're not in control of what makes you interested in things</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h33m36s">What's going on?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h33m46s">That's the Jungian self.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h33m48s">Or that's the manifestation of meaning</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h34m06s">That twist in its tail refers to infinity. Dragons almost always have an infinite tail like that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h34m11s">And it's got the claws of a bird, maybe a bird of prey</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h34m23s">And then down here is this thing called the round chaos. It's an old alchemical system</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h34m45s">Because you could say well the thing that you're exploring</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h34m47s">It's sort of a constructivist idea</a>
00:34:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h34m49s">You explore something new</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h34m53s">You. Because as you explore it you learn things. That changes you.</a>
00:34:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h34m57s">So you generate psyche out of the exploration. That's spirit.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h35m00s">And you also generate the world out of it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h35m02s">But the thing to begin with is psyche and world at the same time</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h35m06s">And that's what this thing represents</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h35m18s">And I'm going to tell you the dream for two reasons</a>
00:35:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h35m20s">One is because it bears directly on these ideas</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h35m23s">Two because well we just covered psychoanalytic thought and I want to show you how a dream can work</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h35m29s">Cause it's not easy to find a dream that you can interpret in a way that's public that makes sense</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h35m33s">Cause they're usually so tightly defined contextually</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h35m36s">You can define them in the therapeutic context because you know so much about the person</a>
00:35:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h35m41s">It's very hard to pull that out and make it meaningful outside of that context</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h35m56s">And I had kind of a birds eye view of it and I was following it along</a>
00:35:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h36m00s">Like maybe you know like a drone would follow behind an object</a>
00:36:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h36m03s">And it was floating</a>
00:36:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h36m05s">And it was really zipping along man, it was really really fast</a>
00:36:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h36m08s">And then the scene shifted</a>
00:36:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h36m10s">To a bunch of scientists they were sitting inside a room full of television monitors</a>
00:36:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h36m15s">And they were watching this thing move across the Ocean</a>
00:36:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h36m17s">And so it was here and it had four hurricanes beside it one here, one here, one here, and one here</a>
00:36:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h36m24s">So it was in the center of four hurricanes</a>
00:36:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h36m26s">So whatever it was was like some bloody potent thing zipping across the ocean</a>
00:36:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h36m33s">Then the scientists got a hold of it I guess and the scene shifted</a>
00:36:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h36m36s">And I was in a museum like an old Victorian museum</a>
00:36:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h36m40s">And this thing, this ball was now inside a</a>
00:36:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h36m43s">Imagine a wood stand</a>
00:36:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h36m46s">With a glass case on top of it</a>
00:36:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h36m48s">It was inside the glass case and it was floating and it was sort of pulsing a little bit</a>
00:36:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h36m52s">And so inside the room there was Stephen Hawking</a>
00:36:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h36m56s">And the American President</a>
00:36:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h37m00s">I don't remember who it was he was sort of faceless</a>
00:37:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h37m02s">But Stephen I thought, Stephen Hawking? What the hell</a>
00:37:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h37m05s">Disembodied intellect</a>
00:37:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h37m07s">That's Stephen Hawking so that's what that meant</a>
00:37:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h37m09s">And the President well he's just the symbol of order</a>
00:37:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h37m13s">And so this thing whatever it was that was surrounded by these winds</a>
00:37:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h37m17s">Had been placed into a category system right?</a>
00:37:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h37m19s">It was in a museum, it was boxed in. It had been conceptualized and categorized</a>
00:37:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h37m24s">Partly by disembodied intellect, that was Stephen Hawking,  and partly by social order</a>
00:37:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h37m29s">And so there's a Binswanger Boss thing going on there</a>
00:37:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h37m32s">The thing pulses and is alive so its got its own power</a>
00:37:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h37m36s">But it's also encapsulated in a category system</a>
00:37:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h37m39s">So I'm a third person observer in there I'm not in the room I'm just seeing this</a>
00:37:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h37m43s">So that was fine</a>
00:37:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h37m44s">So the next thing that happened</a>
00:37:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h37m45s">Oh yes, one of them described the features of the room</a>
00:37:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h37m48s">Its walls were seven feet thick</a>
00:37:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h37m50s">They didn't want this thing going anywhere</a>
00:37:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h37m52s">And it was made out of titanium dioxide</a>
00:37:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h37m55s">I thought, what the hell is that?</a>
00:37:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h37m56s">Well it's a paint</a>
00:37:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h37m57s">It's a paint substance but it's also what the hull of the Starship Enterprise is made out of</a>
00:37:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h38m02s">So my dream was saying well what's the hardest substance there is? Well it's titanium dioxide</a>
00:38:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h38m07s">It's not getting out of that box</a>
00:38:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h38m10s">The walls were designed to permanently constrain the object</a>
00:38:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h38m12s">Okay now the next thing that happened was this object was</a>
00:38:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h38m15s">You could tell it was kind of alive</a>
00:38:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h38m17s">And it kept shifting around and at one point it turned into a chrysalis you know a cocoon</a>
00:38:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h38m22s">And I thought what the hell does that mean?</a>
00:38:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h38m24s">And then, so it turned into a cocoon</a>
00:38:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h38m27s">And I don't know if you've seen a chrysalis when it's just about to hatch</a>
00:38:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h38m30s">But it twitches around eh? It's alive that thing</a>
00:38:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h38m34s">So they're very strange things</a>
00:38:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h38m36s">And then at the end it turned itself into a pipe</a>
00:38:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h38m38s">Like a Meerschaum pipe</a>
00:38:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h38m40s">And I thought</a>
00:38:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h38m42s">Then it reformed itself into a sphere</a>
00:38:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h38m43s">And just shot right out of the room</a>
00:38:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h38m45s">Like the walls weren't even there</a>
00:38:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h38m47s">It decided it was gone bang! It was gone</a>
00:38:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h38m50s">And I woke up and I thought what the hell</a>
00:38:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h38m52s">What the hell does that mean?</a>
00:38:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h38m54s">It took me forever to figure this out</a>
00:38:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h38m56s">So then about two years after experiencing this dream,</a>
00:38:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h39m00s">I was reading Dante's Inferno</a>
00:39:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h39m02s">In the ninth Canto, a messenger from God appears</a>
00:39:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h39m05s">So Dante goes down into hell right?</a>
00:39:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h39m07s">It was Dante's attempt to describe</a>
00:39:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h39m10s">It's brilliant</a>
00:39:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h39m12s">So imagine that you go to a bad place psychologically right?</a>
00:39:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h39m15s">So your life has collapsed that's terrible</a>
00:39:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h39m18s">But then you're trying to figure out what you did wrong and how you're to blame for it</a>
00:39:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h39m22s">And so what you do is a descent</a>
00:39:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h39m24s">A descent into your own foolishness and stupidity</a>
00:39:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h39m28s">Level, by level, by level</a>
00:39:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h39m29s">And that's what Dante was trying to explain</a>
00:39:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h39m31s">That's what that hell was</a>
00:39:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h39m33s">Levels of catastrophe and there's something right at the bottom</a>
00:39:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h39m37s">And he found that it was betrayal that was at the bottom</a>
00:39:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h39m40s">So in any case I was reading that</a>
00:39:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h39m43s">And there's a line in there that made me remember this dream</a>
00:39:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h39m45s">Cause I tried to figure out this dream for years eh</a>
00:39:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h40m27s">So that was like a herald of the arrival of this messenger</a>
00:40:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h40m30s">It's a very powerful scene</a>
00:40:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h40m31s">And I thought about this dream with this thing with the four storms</a>
00:40:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h40m34s">So</a>
00:40:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h40m36s">The pipe thing that really, that really took me forever to figure out</a>
00:40:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h40m41s">And I finally remembered this painting by Magritte</a>
00:40:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h40m43s">This is not a pipe</a>
00:40:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h40m45s">Right so what does that mean?</a>
00:40:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h40m49s">Well what it means is the representation is not the thing</a>
00:40:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h40m55s">It's a very famous painting right?</a>
00:40:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h40m57s">The representation is not the thing</a>
00:40:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h41m01s">Well even the perception is not the thing</a>
00:41:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h41m03s">And that's what the dream was trying to get at</a>
00:41:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h41m04s">It's like this thing</a>
00:41:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h41m06s">This thing that was so powerful and so capable of transforming</a>
00:41:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h41m10s">Could be encapsulated temporarily within a conceptual system</a>
00:41:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h41m13s">But whenever it decided to leave it was just going to leave</a>
00:41:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h41m16s">And so</a>
00:41:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h41m17s">What is was referring to was the potential that there is inside objects</a>
00:41:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h41m21s">So for example</a>
00:41:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h41m22s">And it's such a complicated thing to explain</a>
00:41:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h41m25s">Nobody knew what cell phones were going to do</a>
00:41:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h41m28s">You make the cell phone</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h41m45s">And that's because</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h41m46s">Things are more complex than they look</a>

00:41:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h41m54s">That tends to unfold across time</a>
00:41:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h41m56s">And it's only somewhat predictable</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h41m58s">And so you have things under your control and in your grasp to some limited degree</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h42m38s">I dreamed much later about a year later</a>
00:42:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h42m40s">This was a very cool image too</a>
00:42:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h42m42s">You know that image I think is it  Da Vinci or Michelangelo</a>
00:42:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h42m46s">Of the man inscribed in the square inside the circle</a>
00:42:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h42m48s">It's a very famous image</a>
00:42:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h42m50s">Well it was like that except</a>
00:42:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h42m52s">It was a cube and not a square</a>
00:42:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h42m54s">And so there was kind of a faceless person, almost like a mannequin inside this cube</a>
00:42:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h42m59s">And he was suspended about two feet off the ground</a>
00:42:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h43m02s">And on the front wall</a>
00:43:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h43m05s">It was like wall paper designs, there were these little squares about this big</a>
00:43:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h43m08s">And they mandalas square with circles inside them</a>
00:43:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h43m12s">And then inside the circle there was a little snake tail that was out</a>
00:43:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h43m15s">And the whole wall was covered with these snake tails</a>
00:43:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h43m18s">And the person</a>
00:43:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h43m20s">When the person walked forward the wall would move forward</a>
00:43:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h43m22s">And when he walked backwards the wall would move backwards</a>
00:43:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h43m24s">So it was always this far away</a>
00:43:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h43m27s">And he could reach out and pull any of those snakes into being</a>
00:43:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h43m31s">And so that was another dream of the same sort of idea</a>
00:43:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h43m33s">What do you have in front of you?</a>
00:43:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h43m35s">A world of objects</a>
00:43:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h43m36s">No</a>
00:43:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h43m38s">You have a world of potential in front of you</a>
00:43:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h43m41s">And you can interact with any aspect of that potential</a>
00:43:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h43m44s">And while you're doing so, you realize it</a>
00:43:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h43m46s">You pull something into being that wouldn't have been there before</a>
00:43:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h43m49s">And what you see in front of you is a wall of potential</a>
00:43:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h43m53s">The potential is not infinite because you're constrained</a>
00:43:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h43m56s">But, it's still</a>
00:43:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h43m58s">For all intents and purposes it will do you just fine it's more potential than you could ever need</a>
00:43:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h44m02s">And so the dream</a>
00:44:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h44m04s">See dreams</a>
00:44:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h44m07s">Dreams are at the forefront of thinking</a>
00:44:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h44m11s">They get there before you</a>
00:44:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h44m13s">The creative imagination is at the forefront of thinking</a>
00:44:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h44m16s">If you think that you're moving out into the unknown</a>
00:44:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h44m19s">To gather new information</a>
00:44:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h44m21s">What gets there first is the imagination</a>
00:44:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h44m23s">Obviously that's what Piaget says about children as well</a>
00:44:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h44m26s">You imagine it first</a>
00:44:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h44m28s">Then maybe you can represent it in speech</a>
00:44:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h44m30s">And a dream is part of that imaginative process</a>
00:44:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h44m33s">That's what artists are doing</a>
00:44:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h44m35s">They're going out into the unknown</a>
00:44:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h44m37s">And representing it imaginatively</a>
00:44:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h44m39s">So what does that painting mean?</a>
00:44:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h44m41s">Well if the artist knew that he'd just write it down</a>
00:44:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h44m44s">Right? The art is beyond what's articulable otherwise it's not art it's just propaganda</a>
00:44:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h44m51s">So the artist and the dream their out on the frontier right? That's the open imagination</a>
00:44:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h44m56s">And so when you're conceptualizing new things</a>
00:44:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h44m58s">The dream and the imagination can bring you places that you don't even know that you can go</a>
00:44:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h45m03s">And it's a mystery too</a>
00:45:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h45m04s">It's like I don't know how I figured this out</a>
00:45:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h45m06s">It was as if the figuring out manifested itself inside me</a>
00:45:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h45m10s">Cause that's the experience in a dream right?</a>
00:45:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h45m12s">You don't feel "I dreamed this up"</a>
00:45:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h45m14s">You feel "I had a dream." Where did that come from?</a>
00:45:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h45m19s">It springs out of the unknown and offers something to you</a>
00:45:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h45m31s">Here's pathology as conceptualized by the phenomenologists</a>
00:45:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h45m36s">It's a very interesting way of thinking about it</a>
00:45:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h45m38s">Existential guilt and fear as debt to possibility</a>
00:45:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h45m41s">Well so there's this idea</a>
00:45:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h45m43s">It's like an exisitential idea that you have some problems</a>
00:45:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h45m47s">That you have some problems in your life</a>
00:45:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h45m48s">Well part of the Dasein is the sense of responsibility that you have to address those problems</a>
00:45:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h45m54s">It's part and parcel of the way that human beings manifest themselves in the world</a>
00:45:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h45m58s">So part of your pathology would be failure to bear the responsibility for your being</a>
00:45:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h46m03s">And a sense that you have a debt to your existence</a>
00:46:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h46m06s">And according to the phenomenologists that's built right into the sense of your being</a>
00:46:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h46m14s">It's a remarkable conceptualization</a>
00:46:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h46m21s">Right well that's a good place to stop</a>
00:46:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11oBFCNeTAs#t=00h46m24s">Okay good we'll see you in a week and a half</a>
