<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I-YpuOK774#t=00h03m06s">I often ask how many hours a day you waste or how many hours a week you waste. And the classic answer is something like 4 to 6 hours a day.</a>
00:03:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I-YpuOK774#t=00h03m14s">Inefficient studying, watching things that not only do you not want to watch that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I-YpuOK774#t=00h03m18s">you don't even care about, that make you feel horrible about watching after you're done. That's probably 4 hours right there.</a>
00:03:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I-YpuOK774#t=00h03m24s">Well that's 25 hours a week. It's 100 hours a month. That's 2.5 full work week. It's half a year of work wasted per year!</a>
00:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I-YpuOK774#t=00h03m32s">You're wasting $50,000 a year and you are doing that right now.</a>
