<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h01m18s">one of the things I've noticed about "Peter Pan"-type,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h01m27s">is that they often stay under the thumb of their father.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h01m33s">why would someone do that?" Because it means, they're subject to the tyrannical judgment of their father.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h01m38s">They're always concerned about what their father would think, or whether their father approves of them, and so forth.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h01m57s">Here's a weird little exercise that you can undertake, a little thought experiment.</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h02m03s">So - you have your parents, and</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h02m05s">of course your parents have friends who are about their age,</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h02m08s">and maybe some of them are people you only know peripherally.</a>
00:02:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h02m12s">And I might ask you: "Well,</a>
00:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h02m14s">do you care more about what your parents think, than you care about what these peripheral people, who know your parents think?"</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h02m21s">And then the answer to that is "well, of course".</a>
00:02:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h02m23s">And then, the question that arises out of that, is...</a>
00:02:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h02m27s">"Why?"</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h02m29s">I mean, for someone else your parents are the peripheral people, and their parents are central.</a>
00:02:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h02m34s">Like, why is it logical that your parents make...</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h02m38s">[your parents'] opinion makes any more difference to you,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h02m40s">than the appearance- than the, uh...</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h02m42s">The opinion of some randomly selected people, who are approximately that age?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h02m48s">Why is it the case, that you would consider that they would know more than someone else?</a>
00:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h02m51s">I mean, I know they know you better, and fair enough, but that's not the point.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h02m56s">And then, another point there is, that to the degree that your parents' opinion about you matters</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h03m01s">more than some randomly selected people of approximately the same age...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h03m06s">Jung would say - well,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h03m07s">you haven't exactly separated out the "God image" from your parents.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h03m11s">And so you're still under that combination.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h03m14s">It's like... it's a complicated thing to talk about, but think about the Harry Potter series.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h03m25s">like magical parents, that sort of float behind.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h03m27s">And he should know the difference between them. They shouldn't be one in the same - they're not for him.</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h03m33s">And it's like, well, you have your parents, and you have Nature and Culture as parents.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h03m37s">And you shouldn't be thinking that your parents are Nature and Culture as well.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h03m52s">And Jung said: "Yes, but that death can take place symbolically".</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h03m56s">Okay, so there's that part of the idea.
And then another part of the idea is -</a>
00:03:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h04m02s">- one of the times in your life, when you actually realize that you're an individual,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h04m06s">is when you'll go and ask your parents something, and you realize they actually don't know any more about...</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h04m12s">what you should do, than you do.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h04m14s">And that sucks.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h04m16s">And that's partly why people are often willing to maintain a tyrant-slave relationship with their father. It's like...</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h04m22s">On a one hand you have to be inferior in a relationship like that.</a>
00:04:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h04m26s">You know, you've always got the Judge watching you,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h04m28s">but on the other hand, there's always someone who knows, what to do.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h04m37s">Well, at some point you'll realize, that the reason you can't ask that anymore</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h04m40s">is because they actually don't know any more than you do.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h04m52s">It's at that point, that you could conceivably start taking care of them instead of the reverse.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h04m56s">And that's a time that should come, but you have to let that image of perfection go.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXi9bwI6cY8#t=00h05m01s">And that exposes you.</a>
