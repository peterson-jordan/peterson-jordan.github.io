<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h01m30s">I do that a variety of ways,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h01m32s">You know, one of the things I do</a>
00:01:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h01m34s">is listen for silence.</a>
00:01:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h01m36s">If you have thirty five hundred people in an auditorium</a>

00:01:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h01m43s">what that means is that you've  touched on something, of,</a>
00:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h01m48s">that's of universal importance, in that moment anyways,</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h01m53s">Because it supersedes, the topic supersedes, anything else that's being considered, right,</a>
00:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h01m59s">it supersedes the desire to shift your position in your chair,</a>
00:01:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h02m03s">it supersedes the desire to whisper to your neighbor,</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h02m07s">it grips your attention completely</a>

00:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h02m16s">to listen for that,</a>
00:02:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h02m18s">because, you see that people are in the grip of something;</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h02m24s">and then, you have to puzzle out</a>
00:02:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h02m26s">what it is that they are in the grip of.</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h02m31s">I can tell you some about that.</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h02m36s">Um, you know there is this idea that became popular in the nineteen sixties --</a>
00:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h02m41s">I just talked to Bishop , a bishop, Bishop Barron, about a week and a half ago for my Youtube video channel and for my podcast</a>
00:02:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h02m54s">and uh,  I told him that I was a strange psychologist because I'd never told my audiences that --</a>
00:02:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h03m00s">now I speak to individuals in the audience --. I never tell someone that they are okay the way they are,</a>
00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h03m05s">you know, there's this idea that came up in the sixties that "you're okay the way you are" --</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h03m13s">and, and uh, while I liked that idea very much, and I think it's a very bad idea,</a>
00:03:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h03m19s">especially when you are talking to young people who are lost and nihilistic and depressed and suffering</a>
00:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h03m24s">and aimless</a>
00:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h03m25s">and ideologically possessed and prematurely cynical,</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h03m30s">because they are NOT okay the way they are, and if you tell them that they are,</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h03m35s">then they think, "Well this is it - that's it, that's life - it's like, I've hit the pinnacle at 18."</a>
00:03:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h03m40s">I don't know anything about the world. I haven't contributed anything to it</a>
00:03:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h03m45s">But there is no up because I am okay the way I am."</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h03m50s">It's like, you are not okay the way you are. Especially if you are 18, you've got 60 years to put yourself together,</a>
00:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h03m57s">and you better be better at the end of that than you were at the beginning or something has gone seriously wrong.</a>
00:03:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h04m05s">It's not an optimistic thing to tell people that they are okay the way they are,</a>
00:04:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h04m08s">it's a pessimistic thing</a>
00:04:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h04m09s">Because what you do is denigrate what they could be for what they are.</a>
00:04:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h04m14s">And, and I know that is a terrible idea technically, speaking from  a psychological perspective, because</a>
00:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h04m22s">it's who you COULD be that imbues your life with meaning.</a>
00:04:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h04m27s">It's not the only thing--I mean, you have your friends and your family--but they expect something from you too.  You know they expect the best from you,</a>
00:04:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h04m34s">They expect a certain amount of improvement, especially, if you have children.  But even if you are a child, you might expect some improvement from your parents as well, um....</a>
00:04:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h04m44s">But that's what you hope for - you hope that the person can manifest what's best in them</a>
00:04:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h04m51s">and if they don't do that, then you are disappointed in them, just like you'd be inexorably or are inexorably disappointed in yourself if you don't manifest what's best in you... and</a>
00:04:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h05m03s">and I think  that's very interesting moral law, you know.</a>
00:05:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h05m08s">I talk a lot to my audiences about what I believe to be an incontrovertible fact,</a>
00:05:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h05m19s">and I think that the fundamental incontrovertible fact is that life is suffering. 
 And I think that that's why that's a primary axiom of religious belief</a>
00:05:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h05m36s">in some sense, almost, regardless of the faith, that life is suffering, and everyone knows that, although they don't necessarily like to admit it or to talk about it.</a>
00:05:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h05m48s">I mean, you don't have to scrape beneath the surface very far in someone's life to find a tragedy lurking;</a>
00:05:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h05m55s">if the person that you are speaking with doesn't have something pretty awful happening to them</a>
00:05:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h06m03s">right at the moment economically or socially or within their family or physically or mentally,</a>
00:06:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h06m08s">the probability that someone they love has a problem of that sort is extraordinarily high</a>
00:06:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h06m14s">and if you happen to be among the fortunate minority for whom that isn't true,</a>
00:06:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h06m18s">well, all you have to do is wait and it will be true (laughter)</a>
00:06:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h06m24s">soon enough, and sooner than you think and worse than  you imagine.</a>
00:06:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h06m30s">And so, and everyone knows that,  and so it's easy to understand why people become cynical and bitter and hurt and nihilistic.</a>
00:06:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h06m44s">You know, I think there's a progression in life. You know if you are naive, you think that life will be easy and that people are basically good</a>
00:06:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h06m56s">and then you have some experiences, if you are not sheltered too much, and that gets taken away from you</a>
00:06:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h07m03s">because you betray yourself or other people betray you or you encounter a tragedy and then your naivete is shattered</a>
00:07:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h07m10s">and the most likely place that you'll go from there isn't just something approximating cynicism,</a>
00:07:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h07m15s">because you don't  know the alternative and your initial faith -- which was not faith but naivete --  is shattered by the terrible reality of what you encounter.</a>
00:07:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h07m26s">And then, as a cynical person, you are more wise than you are as a naive person;</a>
00:07:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h07m31s">and then that's a strange thing because you're worse in some sense than you were,</a>
00:07:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h07m37s">you know.   You are not as optimistic and you are not as filled with hope  and your life is more difficult</a>
00:07:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h07m44s">and you're probably harder on other people and with more of a tendency towards cruelty and none of that seems positive</a>
00:07:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h07m50s">but</a>
00:07:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h07m51s">there's a wisdom in cynicism that the naive lack.</a>
00:07:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h07m56s">But the problem is,  there,  that cynicism is not a useful antidote to, let' say, tragedy and malevolence because there are places that you go past cynicism as you approach wisdom.</a>
00:07:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h08m11s">And it's wisdom that you need in order to fabricate yourself this sort of vessel that will keep you afloat during stormy times.</a>
00:08:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h08m28s">And so,  I talk to you, my audiences, about wisdom, and I think I tell them other things that I believe to be true --</a>
00:08:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h08m40s">--it's like,  well --</a>
00:08:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h08m42s">life is difficult and it's tainted by malevolence and it's cast in tragedy and you need something to off-set that</a>
00:08:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h08m55s">because it otherwise it embitters you,</a>
00:08:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h08m57s">and if you are embittered then you become vengeful and cruel</a>
00:08:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h09m02s">inevitably.</a>
00:09:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h09m04s">And then you make everything that's made you worse, worse in turn,</a>
00:09:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h09m10s">and there is no bottom to that, you know,  as any one whose even a moderate</a>
00:09:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h09m14s">student of history soon comes to understand.  Well, there's an idea that hell is a bottomless pit,</a>
00:09:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h09m22s">and the reason for that is that there is no situation that's so terrible that there isn't some damn fool thing that some idiot can do that will make it far worse</a>
00:09:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h09m31s">and it's reasonably probable that you're that idiot. (laughter)</a>
00:09:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h09m40s">And so, the question is:  What might constitute an alternative to that, and if there is an alternative [even]?</a>
00:09:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h09m49s">You know, I learned a while back, a long while back,  reading religious mythology mostly,</a>
00:09:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h09m56s">that,  there is a difference between thinking and paying attention and of the two, paying attention is much more important.</a>
00:09:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h10m03s">It's not the same thing as thinking, like,  when you pay attention, you're looking for what you don't know -</a>
00:10:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h10m08s">like you kind of detach yourself and you watch and you listen and you see if things are the way you think they are,</a>
00:10:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h10m15s">and you hope they are because life is easier if things are the way you think they are;</a>
00:10:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h10m21s">but if you find out that they're not and you're paying attention, then you can weave and you can bob and you can adapt and you can learn and so you have to learn to pay attention.</a>
00:10:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h10m31s">And I just ask people, when I'm speaking, to pay attention  to what they already know.</a>
00:10:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h10m41s">Now, here's something that everybody knows ...</a>
00:10:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h10m46s">You know, in a world that consists of suffering and malevolence, who is it that you admire or who is it that you don't admire?</a>
00:10:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h10m55s">Those are the same question. If you know who you don't admire, well then you have a negative model and you can go for the opposite,</a>
00:10:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h11m03s">and if you know who you admire, well then you can copy that and the instinct for admiration is an instinct for imitation and we're very imitative creatures, and</a>
00:11:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h11m12s">our instinct for admiration is the instinct for imitation.</a>
00:11:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h11m19s">And what would you call it - "A deeply biologically and  metaphysically rooted guideline to the proper path of life."</a>
00:11:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h11m28s">A question is: "Is there a proper path of life?"</a>
00:11:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h11m32s">Well, there are certainly pathways that make things worse,  that's something to know.  You could avoid those.</a>
00:11:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h11m40s">And if there's something, if there are pathways that make things worse then there are the opposite pathways,  even though those might not be so clear---</a>
00:11:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h11m49s">I think that's why we are often so enamored of evil characters in fictional representations--is because it's clearer.</a>
00:11:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h11m57s">it's easier in some sense to make what constitutes the dark path clearer--</a>
00:11:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h12m01s">it's easier for people to understand-- whereas the path that's positive is murkier and more difficult to ascertain.</a>
00:12:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h12m08s">But, at the very least, you know it's the opposite of that.</a>
00:12:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h12m13s">So, well, who do you admire,  or we could start by, who don't you admire?</a>
00:12:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h12m18s">Well, you don't admire an adult who won't take responsibility for himself or herself and COULD.</a>
00:12:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h12m26s">You know, I understand there are people who are so broken and hurt that they need help constantly</a>
00:12:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h12m32s">because they can't take responsibility for themselves,</a>
00:12:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h12m35s">or they can in small ways, but not completely.</a>
00:12:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h12m38s">But you don't admire someone who won't take responsibility for themselves, in fact, you have a sense of contempt for that.</a>
00:12:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h12m44s">And if you happen to be that person then you wake up in the middle of the night and berate yourself with what's left of your conscience</a>
00:12:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h12m50s">for failing to undertake your moral duty --</a>
00:12:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h12m54s">--your intrinsic moral duty --</a>
00:12:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h12m56s">and you can't escape that --- and that's so interesting.  Know that you can't escape that.</a>
00:12:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h13m03s">If you were the creature who could invent your own values, as Nietzsche suggested, as an antidote to the death of God, then</a>
00:13:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h13m10s">you just forgive your transgressions and you wouldn't suffer the bitter pangs of conscience;</a>
00:13:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h13m15s">but you do, and the reason you do is because you are doing things that are wrong,  and you should stop, and you know it, maybe you can't...</a>
00:13:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h13m26s">And then, well let's say then, that the opposite is that you admire someone who can take responsibility for himself or herself, that's a start.</a>
00:13:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h13m34s">And then maybe you admire someone even more if they've forged their characters sufficiently to move past cynicism</a>
00:13:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h13m43s">so that not only they take responsibility for themselves but they can take responsibility for their family.  You know, and</a>
00:13:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h13m51s">they are there for the people who love them when it's necessary.</a>
00:13:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h13m58s">And if you do that, then you have something - I wouldn't say necessarily to be proud of,  but at least you have one less thing to upbraid yourself with.</a>
00:13:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h14m09s">And that's something.</a>
00:14:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h14m12s">And then you can move past that and you can say, well maybe, if you put yourself together enough -- carefully enough, spoke the truth enough,</a>
00:14:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h14m24s">were courageous enough -- in spite of the reasons you have not to be --</a>
00:14:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h14m29s">that you could also be someone of benefit to yourself and your family and your community.</a>
00:14:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h14m35s">And you partake in structuring things in a harmonious manner</a>
00:14:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h14m40s">by living in that way.</a>
00:14:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h14m43s">It's not an individual focused ethos,</a>
00:14:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h14m50s">it's an ethos of harmony among levels.</a>
00:14:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h14m54s">You should do what's good for you but it has to be what's good for your family at the same time and it has to be what's good for you and your family and your community at the same time</a>
00:14:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h15m02s">and that works musically, you know --</a>
00:15:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h15m04s">it makes all the levels work in harmony.</a>
00:15:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h15m07s">And you can tell when that's happening and this is another thing that's of great utility to know is that</a>
00:15:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h15m13s">when you are in that place where you are acting in the proper manner and you are facing things courageously</a>
00:15:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h15m20s">and you're speaking the truth, you are imbued with a sense of fundamental meaning</a>
00:15:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h15m29s">and that meaning is the antidote to the catastrophe of life.</a>
00:15:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h15m33s">And it's the antidote psychologically, because you have to have that meaning, because otherwise your life is too dark and too dreadful and will corrupt you.</a>
00:15:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h15m45s">So it's the antidote psychologically but it's also the antidote practically</a>
00:15:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h15m50s">because we are not nothing, us human beings.</a>
00:15:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h15m54s">You know, they say that we are made in the image of God --- and it's hard to say what that means-- but</a>
00:15:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h16m02s">it means at least,  in part,  to participate in the process of bringing the good into being</a>
00:16:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h16m08s">and we can all do that and the opposite; and if we accept our responsibility to ourselves and to other people and to our communities</a>
00:16:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h16m20s">and we lift that load up,</a>
00:16:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h16m22s">then we live lives that are meaningful and that stops us from being corrupt; it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h16m28s">it provides us with a medication against catastrophe,</a>
00:16:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h16m31s">and it also practically improves the world.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h16m37s">That's the other thing. It's not just psychological,</a>
00:16:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h16m41s">you can make things worse, everyone knows that,</a>
00:16:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h16m44s">and no doubt you have,, in many ways; but you can make things better and they actually get better</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h16m53s">And there's something to be said to know that you are the sort of creature that can look mortality and catastrophe and malevolence straight in the eye,  so to speak,</a>
00:16:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKCK5EhibM#t=00h17m05s">and nonetheless, stand up and do what's right and that all there is, in that, is good.  And that's what I've been telling people.</a>
