<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h02m17s">and of course at that time people were very terrified about the potential outcome of the Cold War and for</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h02m22s">very good reason and I was curious about very curious about this like insanely curious about it it was</a>

00:02:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h02m56s">First the first question was were these merely two ways of looking at the world?</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h03m02s">Because you might think well, there's there's no shortage of ways to live in the world</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h03m07s">That's a moral morally</a>
00:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h03m09s">Relativistic stance and there's something to that obviously because people different people different</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h03m13s">Occupations and they different outlook and and so forth a difficult different political belief</a>
00:03:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h03m17s">so there's obviously many ways that we can thrive in the world and so some degree of</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h03m21s">flexibility with regards to what constitutes your fundamental axioms</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h03m25s">Obviously is is necessary</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h03m28s">But there's a deeper question and and it is a very deep question</a>
00:03:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h03m31s">I actually think it's a it's the question at the bottom of the postmodern conundrum, which is whether or not there are any</a>
00:03:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h03m38s">Reliable meta-narratives. Let's say overarching narratives that can unite people in some fundamental way. And so I was curious</a>
00:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h03m44s">Where were these just two arbitrary ways of looking at the world both?</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h03m49s">potentially equally valid and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h03m51s">We're we battling that out because we didn't know when there was no other way to battle it out</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h03m55s">Or was there something deeper at stake?</a>
00:03:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h03m58s">was it possible that one or the other system was correct in some deep manner and I believe I do truly believe that I</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h04m07s">entered that</a>
00:04:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h04m08s">That universe of questions. Let's say with as open as a mind as possible because I actually wanted to find out the answer</a>
00:04:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h04m16s">you know because well it seemed to me the fundamental question that</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h04m19s">Obviously, we fought a whole Cold War about it was the fundamental question. Who was this?</a>
00:04:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h04m23s">it was the question everyone's my should have been concentrated on and so I</a>
00:04:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h04m28s">Started to study deeply this this particular question. The first question was well, what were beliefs made out of like what exactly is it?</a>
00:04:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h04m35s">What is it? What are we talking about when we talk about a belief?</a>
00:04:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h04m37s">What does it mean that you have beliefs our beliefs structured?</a>
00:04:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h04m41s">and also that was a</a>
00:04:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h04m42s">psychological question rather than a political or economic question and that took me a long time to figure out because I didn't know if the</a>
00:04:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h04m47s">fundamental question was going to be</a>
00:04:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h04m49s">Sociological or political or or economic or psychological energy turned out to be psychological or perhaps it turned out to be spiritual</a>
00:04:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h04m56s">that's another way of thinking about it and</a>
00:04:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h05m07s">If if you could grasp belief</a>
00:05:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h05m11s">what would constitute a credible belief and what would it mean for a belief to be credible and</a>
00:05:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h05m17s">I can give you a little a hint about that. I learned this from Jean Piaget that developmental psychologists brilliant brilliant theorists</a>
00:05:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h05m26s">Genuine genius he was interested in how children organized games and he thought of games the</a>
00:05:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h05m32s">Organization of games by children as the precursor to adult interaction and he made some very interesting observations about games</a>
00:05:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h05m40s">You know</a>
00:05:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h05m40s">especially pretend games which are quite sophisticated because children will get together and play pretend games and what they'll do is</a>
00:05:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h05m46s">They act out a simulation of the world</a>
00:05:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h05m48s">maybe they play house they all get together and they cast each other in different roles and then they each act out those rules and</a>
00:05:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h05m55s">they do that and then in order to simulate something important that they're going to have to adapt to but</a>
00:05:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h05m59s">Piaget noted a couple of things the first thing, you know, that was that children playing games can play the games in a group</a>
00:05:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h06m06s">Thank you very much can play a game in a group</a>
00:06:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h06m09s">But if you take them out of the group and you ask them what the rules of the game are</a>
00:06:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h06m13s">They don't know they can't</a>
00:06:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h06m15s">Articulate the rules of the game yet</a>
00:06:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h06m18s">When you put them together in the group, they can play the game and I thought oh that's just like adults</a>
00:06:18</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h28m45s">Restructures tyrannical order when it needs to be restructured</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h28m48s">And that's what each of us are that's the divine presence in each of us and I do believe that there is no more</a>
00:28:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h28m53s">Fundamental truth than that, I don't believe that you can date down underneath that. I think that's bedrock</a>
00:28:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h28m59s">That's the foundation stone of the house</a>
00:28:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h29m02s">That's the cornerstone of the house and it requires everyone to courageously confront the tyranny</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h29m08s">that's them and the unknown that surrounds them and to work for their own benefit and for the benefit of their families and for the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h29m14s">Benefit of their communities and to do everything they can to benefit the world and to live with true speech as the highest value</a>
00:29:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h29m21s">That's how we sort out the world and we could sort it out</a>
00:29:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h29m24s">We are sorting it out at a very rapid rate and we could do that much much more effectively</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h29m28s">If now I do believe that it's incumbent on us to understand the absolutely fundamental role that these processes take</a>
00:29:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h29m34s">I know we're here today because we all have at least an intimation of that, right?</a>
00:29:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h29m38s">We know that there's something about free speech</a>
00:29:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h29m40s">That's so central that we cannot allow attacks on it to go unchallenged no matter where they occur</a>
00:29:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h29m46s">But it's very useful to have it articulated and to know that this is bedrock</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h29m51s">right

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h29m56s">It's something it's the most fundamental truth that the human race has ever discovered and we we lose it at our absolute</a>
00:29:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h30m03s">Peril, and it's not death</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h30m04s">It's worse than that the peril</a>
00:30:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h30m06s">Because there are worse things than death and the worst things than death is hell and we saw plenty of that in the 20th century</a>
00:30:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h30m12s">And when we let freedom of speech go, that's where we're headed</a>
00:30:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuNeqawPuuY#t=00h30m16s">And unless we want to go there then we should stop aiming for it</a>
