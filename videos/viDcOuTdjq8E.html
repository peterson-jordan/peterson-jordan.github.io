<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h00m05s">You know it's pretty self-evident that life is have got its rat's nest of miseries</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h00m10s">And that's for sure. Maybe you could even make a categorical statement that life is mostly a rat's nest of misery</a>
00:00:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h00m15s">You know you could make a pretty powerful argument for that, but then there's a counter question which is well</a>
00:00:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h00m21s">What if you tried not to make it any more miserable that [had] had to be?</a>
00:00:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h00m24s">right then what then what would it be like and my suspicions are is that a</a>
00:00:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h00m29s">Lot of [that] misery I would suspect that most [of] that misery would go away because it's the unnecessary</a>
00:00:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h00m35s">Misery that really brings you down. You know it's like well someone has cancer. It's like that sucks, but</a>
00:00:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h00m40s">It's not like</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h00m49s">But when someone's out like car turing you in a malevolent way or maybe you're [doing] the same you can always ask yourself was</a>
00:00:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h00m54s">Really this really necessary is this just like I'm useless [add] [on] to the miseries of life</a>
00:00:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h01m00s">that's what disheartens people and so even in your own life if if you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h01m23s">And maybe it has no ultimate meaning we could say that we're feeling particularly pessimistic</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h01m28s">But it still leaves one [question] open which is you didn't do everything you could to make it worse</a>
00:01:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h01m34s">how good could you make it be and the least answer is well it could be tragedy, but maybe not hell and</a>
00:01:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h01m41s">I think that's right</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h01m43s">I really believe that that's that's the most pessimistic</a>
00:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h01m45s">Proper statement the [worst-Case] outcome in the worst of all possible worlds is that your life could be tragic, but not hell</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h01m52s">And that's a lot better than hell, right it's it's you think I could give you an example of the difference</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h01m58s">You're at your mother's deathbed</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h01m59s">Well, that's tragedy here's another scenario</a>
00:01:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h02m03s">You're at your mother's deathbed and all you you and all your idiot siblings are arguing</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h02m08s">Well, that's the difference between tragedy and hell</a>
00:02:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h02m10s">And you might be able to tolerate the first circumstance in maybe it would even bring you closer together with your family members</a>
00:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h02m16s">The second one no one can bear that you walk away from a situation like that sick of yourself and sick of everything else</a>
00:02:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h02m23s">Too and you know it's often the case that tragic circumstances bring out the dragons</a>
00:02:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h02m29s">Because the stress is high and all those things that people haven't dealt with</a>

00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h02m46s">You've got yourself adjusted properly and in relationship [to] your siblings</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h02m57s">If the answer [is] no looks like well put your life together</a>
00:02:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h03m00s">Because it's going to happen and you should be the person who's there that can do it and do it properly?</a>
00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E#t=00h03m05s">And then maybe you'd find that it isn't the sort of thing [that] will undermine your faith in life itself</a>
