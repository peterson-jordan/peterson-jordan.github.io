00:00:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h00m09s">in the previous lesson.</a>
00:00:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h00m10s">The first was that I told you there are two game modes. But after that I only have</a>
00:00:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h00m14s">one game type explained. So I know you've been eager to hear about that ever since.</a>
00:00:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h00m20s">The first type of game we discussed was where everyone has a specific shared goal.</a>
00:00:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h00m26s">You can consider that as a structured game.</a>
00:00:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h00m29s">But the second type of game that Piaget was interested in was dramatic or "pretend" play.</a>
00:00:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h00m35s">How "pretend" play generally works is ... a child can do it alone,</a>
00:00:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h00m42s">but when it is teamwork, the kids usually come together,</a>
00:00:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h00m46s">in a small group, and they put on a short play.</a>
00:00:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h00m51s">It's like ... what would you call that?</a>
00:00:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h00m54s">Spontaneous improvisation.</a>
00:00:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h00m56s">Maybe they are imitating a family, and each one gets a part,</a>
00:00:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h01m01s">that would normally be "mom," "dad," and "baby,"</a>
00:01:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h01m06s">and maybe "pet," dog or cat.</a>
00:01:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h01m08s">"You are the cat, and you are the mother, and you are the father."</a>
00:01:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h01m12s">And then they create a scene.</a>
00:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h01m16s">Like a table with sheets, which children seem to like,</a>
00:01:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h01m21s">and then they play the game.</a>
00:01:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h01m24s">In a sense, what they do is imitate their parents, or their pet,</a>
00:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h01m30s">or the baby. But it's not exactly imitation, and that's important to note,</a>
00:01:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h01m35s">because imitation implies ... if you imitate someone, what you do</a>
00:01:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h01m40s">is copying what he just did.</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h01m43s">For example, there are robots nowadays,</a>
00:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h01m45s">if you want to teach the robot to do something, maybe the robot has an arm, it has,</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h01m50s">you can take his arm and do this.</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h01m59s">And then if you put a can there, he'll do just that, exactly.</a>
00:01:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h02m03s">So you teach him ... he has the ability to imitate movements he has performed before.</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h02m10s">But if you're a kid and you're reenacting a family, and you're the mother,</a>
00:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h02m13s">then you do not copy the precise movements with your body</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h02m19s">your mother made the last time you saw her, or looked at her.</a>
00:02:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h02m24s">What you seem to be able to do instead is watch your mother for extended periods of time,</a>
00:02:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h02m29s">and distill something you could describe as her "spirit."</a>
00:02:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h02m34s">I know that's not really a psychological or scientific word, but it's a useful word,</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h02m40s">because ... you might say her "personality", but it's not exactly her personality,</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h02m45s">for it is her personality as a mother, which is not really her personality.</a>
00:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h02m49s">It's the "mother personality," and that mother personality is something that has already been practiced</a>
00:02:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h02m55s">by mothers from time immemorial.</a>
00:02:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h02m58s">And what the child seems to do when, in this example, she looks at her mother,</a>
00:02:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h03m05s">is distilling what is the spirit of motherhood and then embodying it.</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h03m10s">So you can think of the spirit of motherhood as those elements of behavior and perception</a>
00:03:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h03m15s">and emotion and cognition, that too ... but all those things are embodied and simultaneously,</a>
00:03:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h03m24s">the common elements of how a mother acts in different situations.</a>
00:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h03m29s">So you can say, "That's 'mother-like' behavior." And who knows what that is.</a>
00:03:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h03m35s">What you do is produce the stereotype of a mother, so to speak.</a>
00:03:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h03m40s">People don't like stereotypes, especially in psychology, but almost everything</a>
00:03:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h03m45s">what you think is in stereotypes. There is not much difference between a stereotype and a category.</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h03m52s">Categories are simplifications, and so are stereotypes.</a>
00:03:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h03m54s">Either way, imagine the stereotype of a mother, and the child physically embodies that.</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h04m00s">What she's trying to do is become the mother.</a>
00:04:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h04m04s">Why?</a>
00:04:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h04m06s">That is abundantly clear.</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h04m07s">There are obvious reasons why someone does that.</a>
00:04:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h04m10s">Because without mothers there would be no people. If we don't</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h04m14s">Successful mothers, we would be finished, and we wouldn't be here</a>
00:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h04m17s">to talk about it.</a>
00:04:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h04m18s">What Piaget observed was that this kind of drama was extraordinary</a>
00:04:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h04m24s">was important to children because that's how they learned how to act like them</a>
00:04:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h04m29s">would be older children, would be teenagers,</a>
00:04:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h04m33s">or young adults.</a>
00:04:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h04m34s">It is a "test case" in a relatively safe environment.</a>
00:04:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h04m41s">One of the things I've been thinking about ... It's not easy getting the role</a>
00:04:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h04m45s">of the father, but I think one of the things that dads do,</a>
00:04:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h04m48s">if they are good fathers is that they indicate a safe space</a>
00:04:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h04m53s">in the house, or in the family environment, where the children can play undisturbed.</a>
00:04:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h05m00s">Because play is also very sensitive behavior. By that I mean it's easy</a>
00:05:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h05m10s">to disrupt children's play.</a>
00:05:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h05m11s">If something is wrong with the child, it will not play.</a>
00:05:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h05m14s">You can see that your child is doing well when it plays.</a>
00:05:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h05m18s">You could say the same about your dog, or perhaps your partner.</a>
00:05:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h05m21s">If he's in a particularly playful mood, there might not be a specific problem</a>
00:05:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h05m26s">in the relationship, in the moment, and all needs in some sense</a>
00:05:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h05m31s">are more fundamental, are fulfilled.</a>
00:05:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h05m34s">So in order for children to play properly, you must indicate a safe area where you can</a>
00:05:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h05m38s">should take care of.</a>
00:05:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h05m39s">And then they can experiment with different ways of being, and they do that on their own,</a>
00:05:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h05m43s">but also in the company of other children.</a>
00:05:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h05m45s">And of course what they do is practice for roles for later.</a>
00:05:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h05m50s">You see these things in children in different ways, because</a>
00:05:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h05m55s">they don't just play a parental role, that's a very common part of children's play,</a>
00:05:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h06m00s">but they also get fixated on slightly older kids, maybe a year older,</a>
00:06:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h06m06s">or two years older. Who then idolize, follow and imitate,</a>
00:06:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h06m12s">even more direct than they would with a parent.</a>
00:06:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h06m15s">The child has reasons for that, and the reason is that he</a>
00:06:15</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h33m38s">He started to think about it, "How can we get the plastic out of the ocean?"</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h34m11s">He made some calculations and found that it wouldn't be effective.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h34m56s">So he built a prototype, not too big, and he collected quite a bit of plastic.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO6NvcGKZ20#t=00h35m15s">Then he had a number of engineers evaluate his idea, and they said:</a>
