<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h00m12s">We've discussed the big five traits: extroversion, that's sensitivity to positive emotion.</a>
00:00:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h00m18s">Neuroticism: it's sensitivity to negative emotion.</a>
00:00:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h00m21s">Not all negative emotions. Mostly fear, anxiety, and emotional pain seem to load on neuroticism.</a>
00:00:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h00m28s">Disgust, which is another negative emotion.</a>
00:00:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h00m31s">It seems to be more associated [COUGHS] with conscientiousness, particularly its orderliness aspect.</a>
00:00:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h00m40s">Agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness.</a>
00:00:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h00m43s">We're going to talk about agreeableness today.</a>
00:00:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h00m45s">Agreeableness is a very difficult personality dimension to understand, I think.</a>
00:00:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h00m50s">Partly because it's difficult to dissociate from neuroticism, and as well from extroversion.</a>
00:00:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h00m57s">Because agreeable people like you, and so that kind of sounds like extroversion.</a>
00:00:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h01m01s">And disagreeable people sound like they're hard to get along with. And they sort of are.</a>
00:01:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h01m06s">But people who are high in neuroticism are hard to get along with too.</a>
00:01:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h01m09s">And they tend to be volatile and irritable.</a>
00:01:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h01m12s">And so most of the time, if you're engaged in a contentious issue with someone, and emotions flare, it usually has more to do with trait neuroticism than with disagreeableness per se.</a>
00:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h01m23s">So what I'm going to do is try to describe to you what the agreeable trait is, on both of its dimensions.</a>
00:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h01m29s">And also to lay out the pros and cons of existence on that normal distribution trait at more or less every point.</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h01m39s">Because I think, the way I look at it anyways, is, of all the traits, agreeableness is the one that seems to come with the most marked positive and negative aspects.</a>
00:01:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h01m50s">Features, let's say, so we don't confuse it with aspects.</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h01m52s">The most positive and negative features at each point on the distribution.</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h01m56s">It seems to be a very, very complex dimension.</a>
00:01:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h01m59s">So, I'll read you some of the questions from the Big Five Aspects Scale and that will give you an initial rule-of-thumb estimate about whether or not you're agreeable or disagreeable.</a>
00:01:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h02m09s">And so here are some of the questions.</a>
00:02:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h02m12s">Imagine that you're answering these for yourself on a scale from one to five, strongly disagree to strongly agree.</a>
00:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h02m19s">So the first question is:</a>
00:02:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h02m22s">I'm not interested in other people's problems.</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h02m25s">So, if you are interested in other people's problems, that tilts you towards agreeableness.</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h02m31s">Agreeableness is divided into compassion and politeness.</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h02m34s">Which also sound like very positive things, right?</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h02m36s">Because everyone wants to be compassionate, and everyone wants to be polite.</a>
00:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h02m39s">And so you might say, "Well, is that a virtue? Are those virtues, with the other end being actually negative, to be not compassionate, not polite."</a>
00:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h02m49s">It's certainly worded that way.</a>
00:02:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h02m51s">And that's actually a mistake, because we know that these traits are normally distributed, roughly speaking, right?</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h02m56s">And that that means that there has to be positive and negative features at every single position on the distribution.</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h03m04s">And so to make the pre-supposition, for example, that being extroverted is better than being introverted, or that being emotionally stable is necessarily better than being neurotic, is to make a kind of confusion of moral obligation with trait position.</a>
00:03:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h03m24s">You have to assume that there's advantages and disadvantages all the way along, or the distribution wouldn't have set itself up that way.</a>
00:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h03m30s">Especially because these things seem to be biologically instantiated traits.</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h03m35s">So</a>
00:03:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h03m35s">Anyways</a>
00:03:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h03m37s">If you're interested in other people's problems, they like to unburden themselves to you, you care about them: that's a mark of compassion.</a>
00:03:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h03m44s">If you're more or less indifferent to other people's stupid problems and you wish they'd just get on with it, then you're less compassionate.</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h03m51s">You're harsher and more, well, at the extreme, more callous.</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h03m58s">Ah, let's see.</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h04m02s">Respect authority.</a>
00:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h04m03s">That's politeness.</a>
00:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h04m05s">That's part of agreeableness.</a>
00:04:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h04m16s">Feel others' emotions.</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h04m18s">Compassion.</a>
00:04:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h04m21s">Inquire about others' wellbeing.</a>
00:04:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h04m23s">Compassion.</a>
00:04:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h04m29s">Can't be bothered with others' needs.</a>
00:04:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h04m32s">Take advantage of others.</a>
00:04:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h04m34s">That's disagreeable, obviously.</a>
00:04:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h04m37s">Sympathize with others' feelings.'</a>
00:04:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h04m39s">Avoid imposing my will on others.</a>
00:04:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h04m43s">Wait for others to lead the way.</a>
00:04:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h04m46s">Okay, I think all of those are associated with the trait agreeableness or disagreeableness.</a>
00:04:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h04m50s">So let's think about this for a minute.</a>
00:04:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h04m52s">So I'm going to tell you how I conceptualize agreeableness.</a>
00:04:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h04m56s">The first thing you want to know is that women are more agreeable than men.</a>
00:04:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h04m58s">About half a standard deviation.</a>
00:04:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h05m01s">And that's approximately enough so that if you took a random male and a random female out of the population, and you tried to guess who was more agreeable, and you guessed the female, you'd be right about 60% of the time.</a>
00:05:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h05m12s">But what's interesting about that, and this is something also to keep in mind, about normal distributions, you know.</a>
00:05:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h05m19s">Imagine you have normal distribution, so that most people are in the middle.</a>
00:05:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h05m22s">And then you have another normal distribution, male and female, and mostly they overlap.</a>
00:05:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h05m27s">But, you see, out here, and out here, they don't overlap at all.</a>
00:05:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h05m32s">And so, even though on average, men and women aren't that much different in terms of their levels of agreeableness by the group,</a>
00:05:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h05m40s">if you go out and you look at the extremes, they're very different.</a>
00:05:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h05m43s">So all of the most agreeable people are women, and all of the most disagreeable people are men.</a>
00:05:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h05m48s">And the thing is, the extremes are often what matter, rather than what's in the middle.</a>
00:05:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h05m52s">And so one of the ways that's reflected in society, by the way, is there's way more men in prison.</a>
00:05:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h05m58s">And the best personality predictor of being in prison is to be low in agreeableness.</a>
00:05:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h06m02s">It makes you callous.</a>
00:06:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h06m04s">Now, you might think, "What's the opposite of compassion and politeness?"</a>
00:06:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h06m07s">And the answer to that is, I think it's best conceptualized as a trading game.</a>
00:06:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h06m14s">So let's say that we're going to play repeated trading games.</a>
00:06:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h06m18s">And if you're very agreeable, then you're going to bargain harder on my behalf than you're going to bargain on your own behalf.</a>
00:06:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h06m25s">Whereas if you're very disagreeable, you're going to do the reverse.</a>
00:06:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h06m27s">You're going to think, "I'm in this trading game for me, and you're going to take care of your own interests."</a>
00:06:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h06m32s">Where an agreeable person is going to say, "No, no, at worst this has to be 50-50, but I'd like to help you every way I can."</a>
00:06:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h06m41s">Okay, so you kind of understand that.</a>
00:06:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h06m43s">Now the advantage to being agreeable, then, is that you're good in teams and you're very much likely to give other people credit.</a>
00:06:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h06m49s">The down side of being agreeable is that you're not good at putting forward your own interests.</a>
00:06:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h06m54s">And so one of the things that predicts salary across time, for example, is agreeableness, and it predicts it negatively.</a>
00:06:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h07m00s">And so it's part of the reason why women get paid less than men, and this is something for the women in the class to really listen to.</a>
00:07:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h07m07s">Because how you get paid across time depends on a very large number of things, right?</a>
00:07:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h07m12s">It depends on your skills and your abilities and your position and your social network and all of that.</a>
00:07:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h07m17s">But the other thing it depends on is whether or not you actually go ask for money.</a>
00:07:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h07m20s">Or maybe that you don't even ask.</a>
00:07:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h07m22s">Because actually, you don't ask for money.</a>
00:07:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h07m24s">You tell people that you need to be paid more or something they don't like will happen.</a>
00:07:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h07m28s">And I don't mean as a threat.</a>
00:07:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h07m29s">I mean that you have to be willing, when you're negotiating, to have an alternative.</a>
00:07:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h07m34s">You go talk to your boss, who isn't going to give you money, because everyone wants money, right?</a>
00:07:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h07m38s">It's a competitive game.</a>
00:07:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h07m40s">You're going to have to go there and say, "Look, here's what I do. Here's why it's useful. Here's why you have to give me more money. And this is my opportunities if you don't."</a>
00:07:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h07m50s">And then, you're not taking your boss's money anyway, because it's very frequently the case that he's working for a whopping big company.</a>
00:07:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h07m57s">But he needs an excuse to give you money because everyone's asking for money all the time.</a>
00:07:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h08m03s">And so you have to put your case forward powerfully and disagreeably.</a>
00:08:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h08m08s">Now, you don't want to do it too disagreeably because then he's gonna think that you're a son of a bitch and maybe he's not gonna give you anything and maybe you'll get fired for being mouthy, and all of that.</a>
00:08:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h08m16s">And that certainly happens to people who are too disagreeable.</a>
00:08:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h08m19s">You gotta get the balance right.</a>
00:08:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h08m21s">But it's definitely the case.</a>
00:08:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h08m22s">And the other thing that happens to women that's also worth noting, and this is probably because they're higher in negative emotion, is they tend to underestimate their own utility in business settings.</a>
00:08:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h08m31s">Right, because if you're trying to evaluate what you're like, and you're more tilted toward negative emotion, then the things that you do that are wrong are gonna stand out more on the foreground than the things that you do that are right.</a>
00:08:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h08m43s">So if you go into a negotiation, and you're uncertain already, because you have self doubts, and then you're agreeable in the negotiation, what's going to happen is that you're not going to win as often.</a>
00:08:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h08m55s">And winning, in a business setting, or in a career development setting, means more opportunity for promotion and more revenue generated.</a>
00:08:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h09m02s">Now, the downside of that, of course, is as you climb the business hierarchy, you also have to take on more responsibility, and that responsibility is sometimes unpleasant as well, especially to people who are agreeable.</a>
00:09:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h09m13s">Because you're not necessarily liked if you're in a position of authority.</a>
00:09:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h09m17s">And agreeable people really like to be liked.</a>
00:09:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h09m19s">It's their primary motivator because they're concerned about the maintenance of intimate, positive relationships.</a>
00:09:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h09m27s">That also makes them conflict avoidant.</a>
00:09:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h09m30s">Okay so now, you guys can think about this, but I'll tell you why I think the personality differences between men and women exist.</a>
00:09:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h09m39s">Now, these are speculative hypotheses, but they're reasonably well documented by the relevant literature.</a>
00:09:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h09m46s">So let's think about it.</a>
00:09:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h09m47s">The first thing we might think about is: what's the difference between men and women?</a>
00:09:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h09m51s">How do they differ?</a>
00:09:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h09m53s">Well the first thing we might observe is that if you look at personality differences between pre-pubescent boys and girls, they're not very large.</a>
00:09:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h10m01s">Boys and girls don't differ in terms of their trait neuroticism, for example.</a>
00:10:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h10m06s">What happens is that, when puberty kicks in, women's trait neuroticism rises and it stays higher than men for the rest of their life.</a>
00:10:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h10m13s">And this is why you see this reflected in the different kinds of psychopathology that beset the two sexes.</a>
00:10:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h10m19s">So men are over-represented in alcoholism, drug abuse, anti-social personality, and a host of learning disorders as well as attention deficit disorder.</a>
00:10:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h10m27s">And women are over-represented in depression and anxiety, primarily.</a>
00:10:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h10m31s">That seems to be tightly associated with higher levels of trait neuroticism.</a>
00:10:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h10m34s">Because if you're at the 95th percentile or higher, let's say, in trait neuroticism,</a>
00:10:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h10m40s">there isn't much difference between that and being somewhat prone to depression and anxiety.</a>
00:10:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h10m45s">And because the curves overlap, the curves aren't identical,</a>
00:10:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h10m51s">the normal distributions aren't identical for men and women, you tilt the women's curve to the right towards higher levels of neuroticism.</a>
00:10:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h10m59s">You go out and you look for the person in twenty who has the highest levels of negative emotion.</a>
00:10:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h11m04s">It's much more likely to be female than male.</a>
00:11:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h11m06s">Okay, so let's see if we can figure out why.</a>
00:11:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h11m08s">So, we're gonna tell you some basic differences between men and women and you can tell me what you think about it, if you agree or disagree.</a>
00:11:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h11m15s">Okay, first.</a>
00:11:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h11m17s">Size differential emerges between men and women at puberty, right?</a>
00:11:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h11m21s">Because boys and girls are roughly the same size and roughly the same strength.</a>
00:11:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h11m24s">But men get bigger at puberty, when testosterone kicks in.</a>
00:11:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h11m27s">And more importantly, not only do they get taller and heavier, but their upper body strength is much higher.</a>
00:11:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h11m33s">And that's a real issue for combat, because human beings punch, and there's other animals that do that.</a>
00:11:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h11m39s">Kangaroos do that too, so we're not the only people that punch.</a>
00:11:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h11m43s">But we have clubs on the ends of our arms, and so that's how we defend ourselves.</a>
00:11:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h11m47s">And so if you have a lot of upper body strength, especially across the shoulders, and you're heavier, then you can step into the punch and it's a lot more devastating.</a>
00:11:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h11m55s">Now it is the case that, if you look at the statistics for physical altercations in marriage, women attack their husbands more often than husbands attack their wives.</a>
00:11:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h12m04s">Well, you think, "Why is that?"</a>
00:12:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h12m06s">Well, let's assume that there isn't any reason, other than both people in a relationship can get upset, and the women know that if they hit their husbands, nothing's really going to happen.</a>
00:12:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h12m16s">Right, because if you're a woman about that high, and your husband is, say, my height,</a>
00:12:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h12m22s">unless you hit me with an object or something that's sharp, the probability that you're going to do me any serious damage is pretty low.</a>
00:12:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h12m28s">You might hurt me.</a>
00:12:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h12m29s">But if I do the reverse, and hit you, and I really hit you then I might kill you.</a>
00:12:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h12m33s">And so, at least one of the reasons why women can be more physically aggressive in minor ways in a relationship</a>
00:12:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h12m40s">is because everyone knows, the wife and the husband equally, that the consequence of the physical aggression is much more limited.</a>
00:12:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h12m47s">So, men do more serious damage to women.</a>
00:12:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h12m50s">But women are more aggressive in relationships.</a>
00:12:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h12m53s">So that's interesting.</a>
00:12:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h12m54s">So ok, so there's a body size difference that's important,</a>
00:12:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h12m57s">a strength differential that's important.</a>
00:12:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h12m59s">Next thing, I think...</a>
00:12:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h13m02s">So let's assume that the reason that women are higher in sensitivity to negative emotion</a>
00:13:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h13m05s">is because the world is actually more dangerous to women, right?</a>
00:13:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h13m09s">Because that would be the most logical reason why there would be a</a>
00:13:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h13m12s">sex difference in something like fear sensitivity and punishment.</a>
00:13:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h13m17s">Well first there's the danger of physical altercation.</a>
00:13:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h13m20s">Second, there's the sexual danger.</a>
00:13:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h13m23s">So women become sexually vulnerable at puberty.</a>
00:13:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h13m26s">And why do I say vulnerable?</a>
00:13:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h13m27s">Well it's straightforward.</a>
00:13:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h13m29s">It's because the cost of sex for women is way higher than it is for men.</a>
00:13:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h13m32s">Or it certainly has been throughout our evolutionary history.</a>
00:13:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h13m35s">Because if a man has an unwanted sexual encounter,</a>
00:13:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h13m39s">well then he walks away and maybe he is persecuted by the the state or prosecuted by the state for it.</a>
00:13:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h13m43s">But if a woman has an unwanted, unwarranted, or incautious sexual encounter,</a>
00:13:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h13m48s">and she ends up pregnant,</a>
00:13:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h13m50s">then, well, in traditional societies, you're just done.</a>
00:13:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h13m54s">And even in modern societies that are rich like ours,</a>
00:13:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h13m56s">you're... it's a... I don't have to go into that.</a>
00:13:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h14m01s">It's big trouble.</a>
00:14:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h14m02s">No matter what you do about it, it's big trouble.</a>
00:14:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h14m04s">So being more nervous about that makes perfect sense.</a>
00:14:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h14m08s">But then, here's the last thing.</a>
00:14:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h14m11s">I think that women's nervous systems are not adapted to women.</a>
00:14:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h14m16s">I think women's nervous systems are adapted to the  mother-infant dyad.</a>
00:14:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h14m21s">Because you are not the same creature when you have an infant.</a>
00:14:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h14m24s">Not at all.</a>
00:14:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h14m24s">You're way more vulnerable.</a>
00:14:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h14m26s">And it's partly because you have to express the vulnerability of the infant.</a>
00:14:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h14m30s">And you also have to care for it.</a>
00:14:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h14m32s">Right, so, you think about an infant, especially under nine months.</a>
00:14:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h14m35s">So let's say, how are you going to be wired up if you're going to optimally care for an infant under nine months?</a>
00:14:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h14m41s">And I'm saying under nine months because women generally do the bulk of child care for infants who are under nine months old.</a>
00:14:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h14m47s">And part of the reason for that, there's a whole host of reasons, but part of the reasons for that, obviously,</a>
00:14:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h14m51s">is that they breast-feed.</a>
00:14:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h14m53s">But imagine what you need to be wired up biologically in order to care for an infant.</a>
00:14:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h14m57s">First of all, they're very demanding.</a>
00:14:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h15m00s">Right?</a>
00:15:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h15m00s">Because they're completely helpless.</a>
00:15:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h15m02s">And they're demanding twenty-four hours a day.</a>
00:15:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h15m05s">And it's quite an emotional load.</a>
00:15:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h15m10s">And an infant under nine months is never wrong.</a>
00:15:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h15m13s">Right?</a>
00:15:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h15m13s">What you do to an infant under nine months, is, when they're in distress, you always respond.</a>
00:15:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h15m18s">You never tell the infant, "Get your act together and stop whining."</a>
00:15:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h15m22s">Right?</a>
00:15:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h15m23s">Which you can do to a child that's eighteen months old.</a>
00:15:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h15m26s">You can start having that sort of conversation.</a>
00:15:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h15m28s">But under nine months, it's like, nothing is the infant's fault,</a>
00:15:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h15m33s">it's surrounded in an extraordinarily threatening world,</a>
00:15:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h15m36s">and you have to be responsive to what it needs, regardless of what you want.</a>
00:15:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h15m39s">And you have to be very sensitive to the threats that emerge in the environment.</a>
00:15:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h15m43s">And so I think the price that women pay for that ability to have an intimate relationship with infants in the very earliest stages of development</a>
00:15:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h15m51s">is that their nervous systems are actually wired so that they can perform that role optimally.</a>
00:15:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h15m56s">And the disadvantage to that is that having a temperament like that doesn't work that well when you're dealing with adult men.</a>
00:15:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h16m03s">Especially when you're dealing with them in a business environment.</a>
00:16:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h16m06s">Because it's not the same thing.</a>
00:16:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h16m08s">Not at all.</a>
00:16:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h16m09s">It's a competitive environment.</a>
00:16:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h16m10s">So agreeable people are compassionate and polite.</a>
00:16:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h16m13s">What are disagreeable people like?</a>
00:16:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h16m15s">They're tough-minded, they're blunt, they're competitive, and they won't do a damn thing they don't want to do.</a>
00:16:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h16m21s">So it isn't exactly that they're aggressive, although they will push you the hell out of their way if you're in the way.</a>
00:16:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h16m26s">They're not volatile like you are if you're high in neuroticism.</a>
00:16:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h16m31s">It isn't defensive aggression, it's more like predatory aggression.</a>
00:16:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h16m35s">It's dominance behavior.</a>
00:16:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h16m37s">And so for someone who's highly disagreeable,</a>
00:16:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h16m41s">they look at the world as a place in which they can compete and win.</a>
00:16:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h16m45s">And I'll tell you a story.</a>
00:16:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h16m46s">I have a friend.</a>
00:16:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h16m48s">I gave him my personality test, the Big Five Aspect Scale that Colin DeYoung developed, in my lab.</a>
00:16:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h16m56s">I knew he was a disagreeable guy.</a>
00:16:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h16m58s">By interacting with him.</a>
00:16:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h16m59s">I mean, he's even rude to people sort of spontaneously on the street.</a>
00:16:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h17m03s">I actually like him quite a bit.</a>
00:17:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h17m04s">He's very, very funny.</a>
00:17:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h17m05s">He's also very conscientious, so you can trust him.</a>
00:17:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h17m07s">But he's disagreeable as hell.</a>
00:17:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h17m10s">So I gave him this test because I thought it would be funny, and he came out as the most disagreeable person in ten thousand.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h17m18s">Reasonable in compassion, about thirtieth percentile, but point zero-zero-one in politeness.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h17m25s">So he's extraordinarily blunt.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h17m30s">And he was often brought into corporations to sort of clean them up.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h17m33s">So if a corporation was tilting and not doing well, they'd bring him in to find out who the useless people were and fire them.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h17m40s">And I talked to him about that, because I had the mis-opportunity to have to not have graduate students in my lab, for example, that weren't performing well.</a>
00:17:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h17m47s">And I find it very, very difficult, to, you know, to dress someone down, and certainly difficult to fire them.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h19m53s">It's complicated for people who are agreeable AND conscientious.</a>
00:19:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h19m57s">And actually, I think often, that large corporations, large institutions of any sort, run on the un-heralded labor of people who are high in agreeableness and high in conscientiousness.</a>
00:19:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h20m09s">And they're disproportionately women.</a>
00:20:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h20m11s">My experience in large institutions has been that if you want to hire someone to exploit appropriately,</a>
00:20:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h20m18s">No, not appropriately..</a>
00:20:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h20m19s">If you want to hire someone to exploit productively, you hire middle-aged women who are hyper-conscientious and who are agreeable.</a>
00:20:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h20m26s">Because they'll do everything.</a>
00:20:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h20m27s">They won't take credit for it, and they won't complain.</a>
00:20:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h20m30s">And that's nasty.</a>
00:20:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h20m31s">And I think that happens all the time.</a>
00:20:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h20m33s">And so one of the things you have to be careful of, if you're agreeable, is not to be exploited.</a>
00:20:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h20m38s">Because you'll line up to be exploited.</a>
00:20:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h20m40s">And I think the reason for that is because you're wired to be exploited by infants.</a>
00:20:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h20m45s">And so, that just doesn't work so well in the actual world.</a>
00:20:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h20m49s">One of the things that happens very often in psychotherapy,</a>
00:20:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h20m52s">you know, people come to psychotherapy for multiple reasons.</a>
00:20:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h20m55s">But one of them is they often come because they're too agreeable.</a>
00:20:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h20m58s">And so what they get is so-called "assertiveness training."</a>
00:20:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h21m00s">Although it's not exactly assertiveness that's being trained.</a>
00:21:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h21m03s">What it is the ability to learn how to negotiate on your own behalf.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h21m07s">And one of the things I tell agreeable people, especially if they're conscientious, is</a>
00:21:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h21m12s">Say what you think. Tell the truth about what you think.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h21m15s">There's gonna be things you think that you think are nasty and harsh.</a>
00:21:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h21m18s">And they probably are nasty and harsh.</a>
00:21:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h21m21s">But they're also probably true.</a>
00:21:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h21m23s">And you need to bring those up to the forefront and deliver the message.</a>
00:21:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h21m25s">And it's not straightforward at all because agreeable people do not like conflict.</a>
00:21:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h21m31s">Not at all.</a>
00:21:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h21m32s">They smooth the water.</a>
00:21:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h21m33s">And you can see why that is, in accordance with the hypothesis that I've been putting forward.</a>
00:21:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h21m39s">You don't want conflict around infants.</a>
00:21:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h21m41s">It's too damn dangerous.</a>
00:21:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h21m42s">You don't want fights to break out.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h21m48s">If you're also more prone to being hurt, physically, and perhaps emotionally, you're also maybe loathe to engage in the kind of high intensity conflict that will solve problems in the short term.</a>
00:21:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h21m58s">Because it takes a lot of conflict to solve problems in the short term.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h22m03s">And if that can spiral up to where it's dangerous, which it can, it gets uncontrolled,</a>
00:22:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h22m08s">it might be safer in the short term to keep the waters smooth,</a>
00:22:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h22m12s">and to not delve into those situations where conflict emerges.</a>
00:22:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h22m16s">The problem with that is it's not a very good medium to long-term strategy.</a>
00:22:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h22m19s">Right, because lots of times there's things you have to talk about.</a>
00:22:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h22m23s">Because they're not going to go away.</a>
00:22:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h22m25s">And so partly what you do with agreeable people is, you get them to figure out- and they have a hard time with this too.</a>
00:22:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h22m31s">If you ask a disagreeable person what he wants, say, or she wants, they'll tell you right away.</a>
00:22:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h22m35s">They go, "This is what I want, and this is how I'm going to get it."</a>
00:22:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h22m38s">Agreeable people, especially if they're really agreeable, are so agreeable, that they often don't even know what they want.</a>
00:22:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h22m44s">Because they're so accustomed to living for other people, and to finding out what other people want, and to trying to make them comfortable, and so forth,</a>
00:22:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h22m51s">that it's harder for them to find a sense of their own desires as they move through life.</a>
00:22:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h22m56s">And that's not... look, there's situations where that's advantageous, but it's certainly not advantageous if you're going to try to forge yourself a career.</a>
00:22:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h23m06s">That just doesn't work at all.</a>
00:23:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h23m08s">So...</a>
00:23:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h23m11s">All right.</a>
00:23:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h23m13s">What else do I want to tell you about agreeableness?</a>
00:23:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h23m16s">Well, I can tell you a little bit about the regulation of aggression.</a>
00:23:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h23m20s">One of the things I studied, especially when I was in Montreal, was the development of antisocial behavior in children and in adolescents.</a>
00:23:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h23m30s">Antisocial children, so they tend to be aggressive, antisocial children tend to turn into antisocial...</a>
00:23:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h23m36s">It's conduct disorder, technically speaking.</a>
00:23:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h23m38s">Conduct disordered children tend to turn into conduct disordered adolescents.</a>
00:23:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h23m41s">And then they tend to turn into antisocial and criminal adults.</a>
00:23:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h23m45s">And so I can tell you little bit about how that progresses, I think, because it's quite interesting.</a>
00:23:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h23m49s">And it isn't what people generally think.</a>
00:23:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h23m51s">So, the first thing is, if you want to be criminal, the best way to do it is to be really low in agreeableness and really low in conscientiousness.</a>
00:23:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h23m58s">Because low in agreeableness means, "Things are for me and not for you.</a>
00:23:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h24m02s">And you're not going to get me to do a damn that I don't want to do, and I'll stand my ground."</a>
00:24:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h24m07s">And low in conscientiousness means you can do all the work and I'll sit back and take the benefits.</a>
00:24:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h24m11s">And so if you have someone who's really disagreeable, and really unconscientious, you have someone who's starting to border on psychopath.</a>
00:24:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h24m19s">And if you add high intelligence and high emotional stability to that, then you have someone who won't work but will reap the benefits, who doesn't give a damn about you, who is assertive as hell and who's smart.</a>
00:24:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h24m29s">And a person like that's also going to be charismatic because extroverted disagreeable people are kind of narcissistic.</a>
00:24:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h24m36s">But they're... they'll put themselves forward strongly.</a>
00:24:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h24m39s">And if they don't show any signs of fear, that also indicates that they're confident.</a>
00:24:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h24m43s">And it's easy for people to confuse that with competence.</a>
00:24:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h24m46s">And that's how psychopaths get away with what they're doing.</a>
00:24:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h24m48s">Although they have to move from person to person because their reputation will track them.</a>
00:24:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h24m53s">So anyways, back to the development of aggression in children, the development of criminality in adults.</a>
00:24:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h24m59s">Here's how it seem to work, at least in part.</a>
00:24:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h25m01s">It's more complicated than this, but I'll put in some of the sociological elements as well.</a>
00:25:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h25m05s">So</a>
00:25:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h25m06s">If you take</a>
00:25:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h25m08s">children</a>
00:25:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h25m09s">and you group them together in groups defined by age,</a>
00:25:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h25m16s">So let's say you have 30 two year olds, 30 three year olds, 30 four year olds, all the way up to eighteen.</a>
00:25:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h25m22s">And then you watch them interact, and you code their behavior for kicking, biting, fighting, and property theft,</a>
00:25:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h25m32s">then what you'll find is that the two year olds are by far the most aggressive of the lot.</a>
00:25:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h25m36s">So that's pretty interesting, you know, because you think,</a>
00:25:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h25m39s">"Well, children are naturally peaceful, and if they're aggressive it's because they learn it."</a>
00:25:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h25m42s">It's like, no, that's true for a small minority of children.</a>
00:25:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h25m47s">But there's a substantial number of children who are aggressive at two, by nature.</a>
00:25:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h25m53s">Most of them are male.</a>
00:25:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h25m54s">Now that doesn't mean most children are like that, because they're not, even if you look at two year olds, who are the most aggressive human beings.</a>
00:25:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h26m01s">Most two year olds aren't aggressive.</a>
00:26:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h26m03s">But some of them are.</a>
00:26:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h26m04s">And most of those are male.</a>
00:26:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h26m06s">Okay, so then let's say you identify this cohort of aggressive two year olds.</a>
00:26:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h26m10s">And you track them across time.</a>
00:26:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h26m12s">Track them for the next 2-4 years. Track them until they're four years old.</a>
00:26:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h26m17s">What you find is the vast majority of the hyper-aggressive male two year olds get socialized perfectly well.</a>
00:26:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h26m25s">So by the time they're four, they're temperamentally probably still more aggressive, but they become civilized little monsters.</a>
00:26:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h26m31s">So other people can tolerate them.</a>
00:26:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h26m32s">And that means that they've had parents, or peers, or educational experiences, that enabled them to learn how to interact productively with other kids.</a>
00:26:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h26m41s">And to bring their aggressive nature under control.</a>
00:26:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h26m44s">Some of that seems to be mediated by the opportunity to engage in rough-and-tumble play.</a>
00:26:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h26m48s">And that's one of the things that we know that that helps socialize rats, for example.</a>
00:26:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h26m52s">It's vital to them, but it also seems to really be good for socializing young kids.</a>
00:26:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h26m57s">And rough-and-tumble play, which is something that adult males particularly like to do with young kids, by the way,</a>
00:26:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h27m03s">not before nine months, because they're just too little,</a>
00:27:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h27m06s">but once they become ambulatory, and kind of puppy-like so that they're a little bit more robust, then you can play a lot with them.</a>
00:27:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h27m13s">And you can play with them right at the edge of danger, too, which kids, they absolutely go nuts for that.</a>
00:27:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h27m18s">They love that.</a>
00:27:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h27m20s">When I had little kids, I made this kind of wrestling ring out of these two couches that we had that would hook together.</a>
00:27:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h27m25s">And I'd bring them on there and, you know, toss them up in the air and catch them, you know.</a>
00:27:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h27m29s">Eight, ten feet- no, no.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h27m31s">[STUDENT LAUGHTER]</a>
00:27:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h27m33s">A foot in the air and catch them, and they'd go like this, and then, you know, I'd catch them, and they'd laugh,</a>
00:27:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h27m38s">and I'd throw them up and they're all freaked out and then they'd laugh.</a>
00:27:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h27m41s">So they're learning trust with that in the bodied way, and they're also learning,</a>
00:27:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h27m45s">and this is from stretching them out, and wrestling them, and twisting them around, and letting them pull on your hair and hit you, and all of those things,</a>
00:27:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h27m51s">they learn deep in their bones exactly what can hurt them and what doesn't.</a>
00:27:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h27m56s">And you want to kind of push them to the edge, you know, so that they can tell the difference between what hurts and what's still within the realm of the game.</a>
00:27:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h28m03s">And you do the same thing when they're wrestling with you.</a>
00:28:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h28m05s">So they learn not to, you know, awkwardly stick their thumb in your eye.</a>
00:28:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h28m08s">Or do things that are actually painful like grab your lip and pull it.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h28m13s">It's like, no, no, you let go of my lip, you know?</a>
00:28:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h28m17s">And so, that seems to help regulate the aggressive impulses.</a>
00:28:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h28m21s">And help the child find a more appropriate embodiment.</a>
00:28:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h28m25s">You can think that what you're doing, in some sense, when you're rough-and-tumble playing with kids is teaching them how to dance.</a>
00:28:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h28m30s">Because that is what you're doing.</a>
00:28:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h28m31s">You know? You're making them comfortable in their bodies in all of its extension.</a>
00:28:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h28m36s">And building in that kind of body fluency that you see in people who are well-situated inside themselves.</a>
00:28:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h28m42s">And so that's something to really think about, you know?</a>
00:28:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h28m43s">And it's appalling.</a>
00:28:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h28m45s">We know that the ability to engage in rough-and-tumble play among rats inhibits aggression, impulsive aggression, among rats.</a>
00:28:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h28m51s">We also know that if you deprive rats of the opportunity to engage in rough-and-tumble play, they show pre-frontal cortical developmental deficits.</a>
00:28:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h29m00s">And manifest behaviors that are akin to attention deficit disorder, which you can then treat with Ritalin.</a>
00:29:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h29m05s">And so one of the things that's happening with boys, because they're way more dosed with attention deficit disorder medication than girls is that their natural proclivity to engage in robust and troublesome active play isn't appropriate for a school environment</a>
00:29:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h29m20s">where you're supposed to sit down and shut up.</a>
00:29:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h29m23s">And so the kids get hyperactive.</a>
00:29:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h29m25s">And instead of letting them out to run around until they fall over half exhausted, which is exactly what you should do,</a>
00:29:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h29m30s">you know, and you medicate them, so that their exploratory systems, the activity of which is facilitated by the dopaminergic agonist,</a>
00:29:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h29m40s">that's the ADHD medication, suppresses the play function.</a>
00:29:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h29m44s">It's absolutely appalling. There's no excuse for it.</a>
00:29:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h29m47s">You know, but it's a good indictment of the education system, because why in the world would you take six year old kids</a>
00:29:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h29m54s">and get them to sit without moving for five hours, unless you want them to grow up fat and stupid?</a>
00:29:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h30m00s">Why in the world would you train them to do that?</a>
00:30:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h30m02s">Well it's easier. That's one thing.</a>
00:30:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h30m04s">And when they're sitting there, there's nothing disruptive about the rough-and-tumble play, and that can be quite disruptive.</a>
00:30:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h30m11s">So anyways, most of these kids</a>
00:30:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h30m13s">are reasonably well socialized by the time they're the age of four,</a>
00:30:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h30m17s">using one mechanism or another.</a>
00:30:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h30m18s">They learn how to regulate their aggression and they learn how to engage in fictional play structures with other kids.</a>
00:30:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h30m24s">They learn how to cooperate and compete.</a>
00:30:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h30m26s">And the advantage to having a well-socialized disagreeable person is that they really don't let much get in their way.</a>
00:30:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h30m32s">So if you can get a kid who's disagreeable socialized, that person can be quite the creature, you know?</a>
00:30:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h30m38s">Because they're very forward-moving in their nature and very difficult to stop.</a>
00:30:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h30m43s">But if you don't get them successfully "domesticated," tamed, roughly speaking, by the time they're four,</a>
00:30:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h30m51s">their peers reject them.</a>
00:30:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h30m53s">And that's a big problem because</a>
00:30:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h30m55s">your job as a parent is to make your child socially desirable by the age of four.</a>
00:30:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h31m00s">You want to burn that into your brain.</a>
00:31:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h31m03s">Because people don't know that.</a>
00:31:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h31m05s">That's your job.</a>
00:31:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h31m06s">And here's why, it's easy if you think about it carefully.</a>
00:31:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h31m10s">So you imagine, you've got a three year old child, so halfway through that initial period of socialization,</a>
00:31:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h31m16s">and you take that child out in public.</a>
00:31:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h31m19s">Okay, what do you want for the child?</a>
00:31:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h31m21s">Who care about you?</a>
00:31:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h31m22s">What do you want for the child?</a>
00:31:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h31m24s">You want the child to be able to interact with other children and adults,</a>
00:31:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h31m29s">so that the children are welcoming and smile and want to play with him or her, and the adults are happy to see the child and treat him or her properly.</a>
00:31:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h31m37s">And if your child's a horrible little monster because you're afraid of disciplining or you don't know how to do that properly,</a>
00:31:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h31m43s">then what they're going to do is, they're going to experience nothing but rejection from other children, and false smiles from other parents and adults.</a>
00:31:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h31m51s">So then you're throwing the child out there into a world where every single face that they see is either hostile or lying.</a>
00:31:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h31m59s">And that's not something that's going to be particularly conducive to the mental health or the wellbeing of your child.</a>
00:31:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h32m04s">If your child can learn a couple simple rules of behavior, like don't interrupt adults when they're talking too much,</a>
00:32:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h32m10s">and pay attention, and try not to hit the other kids over the head with the truck any more than is absolutely necessary,</a>
00:32:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h32m15s">and share and play properly, then when they meet other kids, the kids are going to try out a few little play routines on them,</a>
00:32:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h32m22s">and that's going to go well, and then they're going to go off, and socialize each other for the rest of their lives.</a>
00:32:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h32m27s">Because that's what happens, is that from four years old onwards, the primary socialization with children takes place among other children.</a>
00:32:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h32m35s">And so if the kids don't get in on that early,</a>
00:32:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h32m38s">they don't move into that developmental spiral upwards and they're left behind.</a>
00:32:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h32m42s">And you can imagine how terrible that is, because a four year old will not play with another four year old who's two.</a>
00:32:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h32m49s">But a five year old certainly will not play with a five year old who's two.</a>
00:32:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h32m53s">Right, because the gap is just starting to become unbelievably large.</a>
00:32:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h32m56s">And so the kids start out behind, and then the peers leave them behind,</a>
00:32:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h33m00s">and then those kids are alienated and outside the peer group for the rest of their life.</a>
00:33:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h33m06s">Those are the ones that grow up to be long-term anti-social.</a>
00:33:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h33m09s">They're already aggressive. It doesn't dip down.</a>
00:33:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h33m12s">Now what happens to normal boys, roughly speaking,</a>
00:33:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h33m15s">imagine the aggressive two year old types,</a>
00:33:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h33m18s">they get socialized, so their level of aggression goes down, and then they hit puberty, and testosterone kicks in, and bang!</a>
00:33:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h33m24s">Levels of aggression go back up.</a>
00:33:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h33m26s">And so that's why males are criminals between the ages roughly of sixteen and about twenty-five.</a>
00:33:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h33m31s">And it matches the creativity curve, by the way. It's so cool.</a>
00:33:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h33m34s">If you look at the spike of creativity among men, sixteen to twenty-five, it starts to go down,</a>
00:33:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h33m40s">criminality matches that absolutely perfectly.</a>
00:33:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h33m42s">So that's quite cool.</a>
00:33:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h33m44s">So the testosterone levels raise the average level of aggression among men,</a>
00:33:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h33m50s">more dominance than aggression, actually, and testosterone is by no means all bad,</a>
00:33:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h33m54s">and then it starts to decrease around age twenty-five or twenty-six, which is usually, with men,</a>
00:33:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h33m59s">stop staying up late at night, stop drinking as much, develop a full time career, and take on the burdens and responsibilities and opportunities that are associated with a long-term partner and family.</a>
00:33:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h34m13s">So that's the development of what I would call predatory aggression, because I also think that the agreeableness distribution is probably something like predatory aggression,</a>
00:34:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h34m26s">versus maternal sympathy.</a>
00:34:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h34m27s">It's something like that.</a>
00:34:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h34m29s">So if you look at other mammals that are predators, because we're predators as well as prey animals,</a>
00:34:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h34m35s">if you look at other animals like bears,</a>
00:34:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h34m37s">the male bear has absolutely nothing to do with the raising of the infants.</a>
00:34:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h34m40s">In fact, the female bears will keep the male the hell away because he's likely to kill the infants,</a>
00:34:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h34m45s">and maybe even to eat them.</a>
00:34:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h34m47s">So there's no maternality at all in solitary, male, mammalian predators.</a>
00:34:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h34m54s">Now it depends on how social they are, but roughly speaking, that's the situation.</a>
00:34:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h34m58s">Whereas with human beings, males are quite maternal.</a>
00:34:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h35m02s">So, but anyways, I think the extreme of agreeableness,</a>
00:35:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h35m07s">on the low end, so disagreeableness, is predation.</a>
00:35:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h35m11s">And the extreme on the upper end is maternal caring.</a>
00:35:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h35m14s">And those two things compete, right?</a>
00:35:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h35m16s">Obviously, it's very difficult to be both of those at the same time.</a>
00:35:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h35m21s">And so men, of course, in the wild, so to speak, are...</a>
00:35:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h35m24s">Very, very few women hunt</a>
00:35:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h35m27s">in modern societies or in archaic societies.</a>
00:35:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h35m29s">And you can also understand why that it because hunting actually requires hurting something, killing it.</a>
00:35:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h35m35s">And it's usually something that's not very impressed about being hurt or killed, and it will emit a lot of distress while it's happening.</a>
00:35:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h35m41s">And so for anybody who's compassionate, who's got compassion as one of the fundamental elements of their temperament,</a>
00:35:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h35m48s">that's something they're just not going to be able to tolerate at all.</a>
00:35:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h35m51s">In the evolutionary landscape, because that's really what we're talking about,</a>
00:35:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h35m55s">there's tension behind the development of different modes of being in the world.</a>
00:35:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h36m00s">And if you're good at one thing, that sometimes means that you can't be good at the other thing at the same time.</a>
00:36:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h36m06s">So...</a>
00:36:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h36m08s">I was going to have a guest speaker for you last week, but the person I had invited in had some familial trouble,</a>
00:36:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h36m13s">so that didn't work out.</a>
00:36:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h36m14s">She's a graduate student of mine and one of the things that we'd be working on in my lab, generally speaking,</a>
00:36:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h36m20s">is the delineation of the relationship between personality traits and political belief.</a>
00:36:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h36m26s">And so I told you a little bit about the things that distinguish liberals from conservatives, right?</a>
00:36:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h36m30s">The conservatives are high in conscientiousness, especially orderliness,</a>
00:36:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h36m34s">and low in trait openness.</a>
00:36:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h36m37s">And so that means a conservative is someone who puts someone in boxes, puts the boxes in order,</a>
00:36:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h36m42s">and doesn't like them to be messed up.</a>
00:36:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h36m45s">So they like the borders between things to remain determinate and what would you say,</a>
00:36:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h36m53s">inviolable.</a>
00:36:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h36m54s">And I think that's true at every level from the conceptual all the way up to the political.</a>
00:36:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h36m58s">I think that the fundamental political question</a>
00:36:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h37m02s">and I think this is why the temperaments align across these political dimensions,</a>
00:37:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h37m06s">is whether the borders between things should be open or closed.</a>
00:37:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h37m09s">We see this reflected worldwide right now in then arguments about immigration, right?</a>
00:37:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h37m14s">Because the liberal types are saying, "Open the gates."</a>
00:37:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h37m16s">And the conservatives are saying, "Wait, you don't know what you're inviting in."</a>
00:37:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h37m20s">And you might say, "Well, who's right?"</a>
00:37:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h37m22s">And the answer is you don't know.</a>
00:37:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h37m25s">That's the thing.</a>
00:37:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h37m26s">Because sometimes the right answer is, "Open the gates, these are interesting people, we could trade with them, we could learn from each other."</a>
00:37:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h37m32s">And sometimes the answer is, "Don't bother. What's going to come in is going to wipe you out and kill you, and really do it."</a>
00:37:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h37m38s">I mean, so, here's an example.</a>
00:37:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h37m41s">This is why I think orderliness is associated with disgust sensitivity.</a>
00:37:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h37m45s">And it's one of the determining factors of conservative political belief.</a>
00:37:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h37m49s">What happened when the Europeans came to North America?</a>
00:37:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h37m51s">What happened when the Spaniards came to North America?</a>
00:37:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h37m55s">95% of the Native Americans died.</a>
00:37:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h37m58s">Why?</a>
00:37:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h38m00s">Because the Spaniards brought illness.</a>
00:38:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h38m02s">Smallpox, measles, chicken pox, all these things that the Native Americans had absolutely no resistance to.</a>
00:38:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h38m08s">There were hardly any diseases at all in North and South America.</a>
00:38:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h38m12s">The Spaniards showed up, within 15-20 years, 19 out of 20 of the Native Americans were dead.</a>
00:38:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h38m18s">You never know what people are bringing with them.</a>
00:38:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h38m21s">And so what that means is that how should you respond to people who are outside of your circle of familiarity?</a>
00:38:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h38m28s">Well the answer is</a>
00:38:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h38m30s">One, they might kill you, in all sorts of ways .</a>
00:38:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h38m33s">Two, they might bring with them things to trade that are of inestimable value.</a>
00:38:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h38m38s">So you're stuck. It's like, how the hell are you going to reconcile that problem?</a>
00:38:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h38m42s">And the answer is, well we reconcile it temperamentally, roughly speaking.</a>
00:38:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h38m46s">So half the people are temperamentally wired up to say, "No, no, no! Let's keep the damn boxes closed. Took a long time to pack everything in there and to get it into order."</a>
00:38:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h38m56s">And the liberals say, "Well wait a minute. You don't know if you've got things in the right boxes to begin with. The things that you're keeping in there were getting stale and old. And maybe we need some new ideas and new people to rejuvenate the situation."</a>
00:38:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h39m09s">That's political discussion.</a>
00:39:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h39m11s">And the political discussion has to proceed because there's no way of solving that problem except by discussing it.</a>
00:39:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h39m18s">Well, how does that relate to agreeableness?</a>
00:39:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h39m20s">We also looked at political correctness.</a>
00:39:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h39m23s">And so here's an interesting thing.</a>
00:39:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h39m25s">Purely from a scientific perspective.</a>
00:39:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h39m27s">You might ask yourself,</a>
00:39:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h39m29s">If you talk about political correctness, one of the things that the people who tend to be labeled as politically correct say is</a>
00:39:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h39m36s">there's no such thing as political correctness.</a>
00:39:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h39m38s">It's just a pejorative label that people who are opposed to those views impose on a set of beliefs to demonize it.</a>
00:39:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h39m46s">Perfectly reasonable objection, and you never know, it might be true.</a>
00:39:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h39m49s">But the thing is, psychometrically, you can solve that problem,</a>
00:39:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h39m52s">and you solve it the same way that you solve the problem of what constitutes human personality.</a>
00:39:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h39m57s">So this is the way we tried to solve it.</a>
00:39:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h39m58s">You can think about it methodologically, because that's how you should think about it.</a>
00:39:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h40m02s">The first thing we did was collect a very large number of statements from press accounts that seemed to indicate what people generally referred to as political correctnes.</a>
00:40:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h40m11s">So we had a small team of people combing media reports</a>
00:40:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h40m15s">to come out with opinions or attitudes that looked like they were characteristic of the differentiation between politically correct people and people who aren't politically correct.</a>
00:40:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h40m24s">So we got about four hundred statements like that.</a>
00:40:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h40m27s">And what you want to do is, you imagine that there's a core set of beliefs and statements that people are defining in a particular way.</a>
00:40:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h40m35s">And you're trying to get a handle on what that is, and even if it exists.</a>
00:40:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h40m39s">What you do is over-sample it.</a>
00:40:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h40m41s">If you can find questions that might even tangentially be related to the phenomena in question,</a>
00:40:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h40m48s">you include those.</a>
00:40:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h40m50s">Because the statistics will take care of the excess.</a>
00:40:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h40m53s">Okay, so then what you do is you take your four hundred items, roughly speaking,</a>
00:40:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h40m56s">and you get people to register the degree to which they agree or disagree with them, get a thousand people to do that.</a>
00:40:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h41m03s">And then you subject that to a factor analysis.</a>
00:41:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h41m05s">And what the factor analysis does is tell how those questions clump.</a>
00:41:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h41m10s">Now, they might not clump.</a>
00:41:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h41m12s">So for example, you could do a factor analysis of a set of questions, and you could find that there are</a>
00:41:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h41m17s">two hundred factors, let's say you have four hundred items.</a>
00:41:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h41m20s">There's two hundred factors.</a>
00:41:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h41m21s">And none of them... there's no big set of questions that are clumping together.</a>
00:41:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h41m25s">And you say, "Well, there's no evidence here that there is a single, underlying phenomena that unifies those questions that you can reasonably characterize with a name."</a>
00:41:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h41m35s">Well that isn't what we found.</a>
00:41:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h41m37s">We found that there were two dimensions of political correctness.</a>
00:41:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h41m40s">One of them looked like liberalism,</a>
00:41:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h41m43s">except that the people who were politically correct, in addition to being liberal, were very high in trait agreeableness.</a>
00:41:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h41m51s">And agreeableness has almost nothing to do with the classic liberal-conservative divide.</a>
00:41:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h41m55s">It's weakly related in that conservatives are more compassionate than liberals,</a>
00:41:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h41m59s">Sorry, liberals are more compassionate than conservatives, the difference isn't huge,</a>
00:41:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h42m03s">and conservatives are more polite than liberals, and the difference isn't huge.</a>
00:42:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h42m08s">So those are the two aspects of agreeableness.</a>
00:42:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h42m09s">If you put them together, they cancel each other out.</a>
00:42:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h42m12s">And so on average, conservatives and liberals don't differ in agreeableness.</a>
00:42:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h42m15s">But political correctness did clump together into two categories,</a>
00:42:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h42m22s">PC liberalism, we call it PC authoritarianism.</a>
00:42:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h42m25s">The PC liberals were high in openness,</a>
00:42:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h42m28s">high in verbal intelligence, and high in agreeableness.</a>
00:42:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h42m32s">And the second group was PC authoritarians.</a>
00:42:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h42m34s">And they were also high in agreeableness, but they were high in orderliness, and the correlation with that was negative in relationship to verbal intelligence.</a>
00:42:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h42m41s">So we found that there were two categories of political correctness, that it does in fact exist,</a>
00:42:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h42m47s">but that it's a very unstable construct because</a>
00:42:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h42m50s">factor one, which was PC liberalism, and factor two, which was PC authoritarianism, were only correlated at 0.1.</a>
00:42:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h42m58s">And so what it indicates, and this is our prediction, roughly speaking, from the lab, is to the degree that there's unity, so to speak, on the politically correct left,</a>
00:42:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h43m05s">it'll fragment into two groups.</a>
00:43:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h43m07s">One will be the PC liberals, and the other will be the PC authoritarians, because although they're united by their tendency to agreeableness, they're not united by other temperamental traits, nor in their core beliefs.</a>
00:43:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h43m18s">So the PC authoritarian types, for example, are very obsessed with language control.</a>
00:43:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h43m24s">And it's funny that it's agreeableness. I've really been thinking about that.</a>
00:43:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h43m27s">You know, again, this is a hypothesis in development, but I think what's happening is that</a>
00:43:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h43m33s">you know, your temperamental proclivity allows you to lay out a kind of radical simplification on the world.</a>
00:43:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h43m40s">That's part of the advantage of having a temperament.</a>
00:43:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h43m42s">So if you're a conscientious person, the world is a place to go out there and work.</a>
00:43:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h43m46s">If you're an open person, the world is a place to go out there to discover new ideas and do artistic things.</a>
00:43:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h43m50s">If you're an agreeable person, the world's a place to go out there and establish intimate relationships.</a>
00:43:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h43m55s">So they're simplifying</a>
00:43:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h43m59s">perspectives, and simplifying personalities.</a>
00:43:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h44m02s">They're the manner in which you're adapted to a particular niche.</a>
00:44:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h44m09s">I think what you see in agreeableness in relationship to political belief is a proclivity for people to divide the world into defenseless infants and predatory oppressors.</a>
00:44:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h44m21s">And that that's blasted forward onto the political landscape, and things are conceptualized along that temperamental variable.</a>
00:44:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h44m29s">Anyways, that's where we're at with regards to the analysis of political belief.</a>
00:44:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h44m35s">Well, we've got three minutes left, and I'm wondering if anyone has a particularly intelligent question or failing that, any question at all?</a>
00:44:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h44m43s">Because I told you a lot of things that are, I would say contentious.</a>
00:44:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h44m46s">But I also think they're very much worth knowing.</a>
00:44:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h44m49s">So I, yes?</a>
00:44:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h44m51s">Did you say that high in agreeableness is the simplified perspective of the mother-infant dynamic?</a>
00:44:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h44m58s">Yeah, that's what it looks like to me, yeah.</a>
00:44:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h45m02s">Projected onto the world, period. Yeah.</a>
00:45:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h45m06s">So what would you say is the best way to go about, knowing that we have these simplified ways of looking at the world, what then?</a>
00:45:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h45m13s">It's really useful to investigate the viewpoints of people who have opposing views to yours.</a>
00:45:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h45m20s">Because they'll tell you things, not only will they tell you things you don't know,</a>
00:45:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h45m24s">they'll also tell you how to see the world in ways that you don't see it.</a>
00:45:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h45m28s">And they'll also have skills that you don't have, that you could develop.</a>
00:45:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h45m32s">So for example, if you're an introverted person, it's very useful to watch an extroverted person, because the extroverted person has ways of being in the social world that aren't natural to you,</a>
00:45:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h45m40s">that you can use to improve your toolkit.</a>
00:45:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h45m43s">And if you're disagreeable, one of the best things to do with disagreeable people, especially if that's alienating them from other people, for example, because it can,</a>
00:45:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h45m51s">you know, people treat you like you're a selfish, arrogant son-of-a-bitch, and maybe that's because you are.</a>
00:45:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h45m55s">It's like, okay, so what do you do about that?</a>
00:45:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h45m57s">One of the most promising "treatments," let's say,</a>
00:45:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h46m03s">is get the person to do something for someone else once a day.</a>
00:46:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h46m06s">Just as a practice, and learn how to do it.</a>
00:46:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h46m09s">Maybe you can wake the circuit up, you know, if you think that it's lying dormant in you, which is probably right.</a>
00:46:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h46m14s">You know, I think we have a very wide range of propensities within us.</a>
00:46:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h46m18s">Some are switched on.</a>
00:46:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h46m20s">Genetic propensity. </a>
00:46:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h46m22s">But I think that if you put yourself in the right situation or walk yourself through the right exercises, you can switch some of these other things on as well.</a>
00:46:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h46m28s">But it takes work and dedication and discipline to do it.</a>
00:46:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h46m31s">So actively confront the things which are not a part of our personality?</a>
00:46:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h46m35s">Yes. Well, I would say, generally speaking, if you want to adapt yourself properly to life, you should find a niche in the environment that corresponds with your temperament.</a>
00:46:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h46m43s">Right? You shouldn't work at cross-purposes to your temperament, because it's just too damn difficult.</a>
00:46:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h46m48s">But having done that,</a>
00:46:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h46m50s">then you should work on developing the skills and viewpoints that exist in the space opposite to your personality.</a>
00:46:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h46m58s">Because that's where you're fundamentally underdeveloped.</a>
00:46:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h47m00s">That way you can extend out your temperamental capability across a wider range, and to me that's roughly equivalent as bringing a richer toolkit to each situation.</a>
00:47:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h47m11s">You know, so if you're hyper-extroverted, you should probably learn to shut up at parties now and then.</a>
00:47:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h47m14s">And listen just to see what's going on, to see if you can manage it.</a>
00:47:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h47m18s">And if you're introverted, well then you should learn how to speak in public, and to learn how to go to parties without hiding in the corner and saying nothing to anyone.</a>
00:47:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h47m27s">And if you're agreeable, then you need to learn how to be disagreeable, so people can't push you around.</a>
00:47:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h47m31s">And if you're disagreeable, you need to learn how to be agreeable so that you're not an evil son-of-a-bitch, you know?</a>
00:47:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h47m36s">And the same thing applies even in the conscientious domain.</a>
00:47:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h47m40s">If you're too conscientious, you need to learn to relax and let go a little bit.</a>
00:47:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h47m46s">And if you're unconscientious, it's time, like, get out and Google "calendar," man, and start scheduling your day, right, and beat yourself on the back of the head with a stick until you're disciplined enough so that you can actually stick to something for some length of time.</a>
00:47:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h47m59s">And not living in absolute squalor, which is something that would characterize someone who is very disorderly, for example.</a>
00:47:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h48m05s">Because they just don't notice. It doesn't bother them, disorder.</a>
00:48:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h48m10s">It's like, maybe they can see it, but it doesn't have any emotional valence and so it doesn't have any motivational significance.</a>
00:48:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h48m18s">The other thing you might want to think about, too, if you're choosing a partner, is try not to choose someone who's too distant from you on the temperamental variables.</a>
00:48:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h48m26s">Because you're going to have a hard time bridging the gap.</a>
00:48:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h48m28s">You know, it's hard for an introverted person and an extroverted person to co-exist.</a>
00:48:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h48m33s">And it's really hard for an orderly person and a disorderly person to co-exist because they will drive each other nuts.</a>
00:48:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h48m39s">Why don't you pick up?</a>
00:48:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h48m40s">Why are you so obsessed by it?</a>
00:48:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h48m42s">That's the basic argument.</a>
00:48:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h48m45s">So it's useful to know about your temperament so that you can negotiate the space with your partner as well, and I don't think you should try to find someone who's exactly the same as you,</a>
00:48:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h48m54s">because then you don't have the benefits of the alternative viewpoint.</a>
00:48:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h48m58s">But you've gotta watch it because you may hit irreconcilable differences of various sorts.</a>
00:48:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h49m02s">And I've seen that most particularly among couples who are high and low in openness, that's a rough one.</a>
00:49:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h49m09s">And also high and low in conscientiousness, that's another rough one, because they just cannot see how the other person sees the world at all.</a>
00:49:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eHJ9DdoEA#t=00h49m18s">Okay, I'll see you on Tuesday.</a>
