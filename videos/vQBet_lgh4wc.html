00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h00m03s">Well that's a good one</a>
00:00:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h00m04s">Let's do a little review of Jungian Psychology.</a>
00:00:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h00m06s">The first thing is, if you want to know about this</a>
00:00:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h00m09s">The proper source is Carl Jung's collected works volume 9</a>
00:00:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h00m15s">And there's two parts to volume 9
A and B published as separate texts</a>
00:00:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h00m20s">And volume 9 is called "archetypes of the collective unconscious"</a>
00:00:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h00m26s">The other one is called Ion</a>
00:00:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h00m30s">In archetypes of the collective unconscious there's a good discussion of the persona and the shadow</a>
00:00:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h00m35s">The persona you could say is...</a>
00:00:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h00m38s">A good way of thinking about it
You know, you watch all those romcoms</a>
00:00:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h00m42s">Where there's always some kind of a beta male guy who is being real friendly</a>

00:00:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h00m52s">He's a persona</a>
00:00:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h00m54s">And a persona is the face you show to the world when you're trying to pretend</a>
00:00:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h01m01s">To convince yourself and other's that, I'd say, harmless, but we could say a good person</a>
00:01:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h01m07s">But a good person isn't harmless, a good person is capable of</a>
00:01:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h01m14s">Well, maybe a good person is capable of anything</a>
00:01:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h01m17s">But is willing to hold that in abeyance</a>
00:01:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h01m21s">I read this interesting commentary a little while ago on a statement by christ in the new testament</a>
00:01:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h01m27s">The statement generally interpreted is that the meek shall inherit the earth</a>
00:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h01m31s">I was looking up the multiple translations of the word meek</a>
00:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h01m35s">Meek is actually derived from a Greek word of course</a>
00:01:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h01m39s">Because the bible, at least some of the original forms of the original bible were in Greek</a>
00:01:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h01m45s">And that word didn't exactly mean meek, it meant something like</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h01m53s">Those who have weapons and the ability to use them but determine to keep them sheathed will inherit the world</a>
00:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h02m01s">And that means that people who are capable of force, let's say</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h02m07s">But decide not to use it are in the proper moral position</a>
00:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h02m12s">Nietzsche commented a fair bit on that too</a>
00:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h02m15s">He thought of most morality as cowardes
Not because morality itself was cowardes</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h02m21s">But because most people who are cowards disguise their cowardes as morality</a>
00:02:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h02m27s">And they claim that their harmlessness, which is actually a consequence of their fear</a>
00:02:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h02m33s">And inability to be harmfull, say, or to be dangerous is actually a sign of their moral integrity</a>
00:02:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h02m40s">And that's a really bad idea</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h02m43s">If you're an ex-murderer but you don't have an axe, that doesn't mean that you're moral</a>
00:02:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h02m50s">So that's the persona</a>
00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h02m53s">And the persona is the mask that you wear, and that's what persona means</a>
00:02:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h02m56s">It's the mask that you wear to convince yourself and the world that you're not a terrible monster</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h03m01s">So that when you look at yourself in the mirror you don't have to run away screaming</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h03m04s">And you might think, well, that's a bit of an overstatement</a>
00:03:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h03m07s">But Jung was very interested in phenomena such as</a>
00:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h03m13s">The psychological phenomena that would characterise the actions of someone who might be</a>
00:03:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h03m19s">An Auschwitz camp guard for example</a>
00:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h03m23s">That's a pretty monstrous form of behaviour</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h03m27s">The thing about Auschwitz camp guards is that there's no reason to assume</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h03m31s">Really, that they were much different than normal people</a>
00:03:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h03m34s">Now there would have been exceptions obviously</a>
00:03:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h03m37s">And what that means is that, perhaps you too can be an Auschwitz camp guard</a>
00:03:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h03m42s">And perhaps you would even derive some enjoyment out of it</a>
00:03:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h03m44s">And you might think not, but you shouldn't think not so quickly</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h03m48s">What that also implies is that if you could see what that meant</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h03m51s">When you looked in the mirror and looked at yourself</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h03m53s">You might run away screaming</a>
00:03:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h03m55s">Because you'd have a revelation of just exactly what a human being is capable of</a>
00:03:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h03m59s">And that's a very unpleasant revelation and also one of the things that stops people from being enlightened</a>
00:03:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h04m04s">Because that revelation of the evil of the self is part of the journey to enlightenment, and an early part</a>
00:04:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h04m11s">Now the shadow would be all the parts of the personality that the persona rejects</a>
00:04:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h04m16s">And that might be the aggressive elements</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h04m18s">Certainly that's the case for people who are hyper agreeable</a>
00:04:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h04m26s">There's two pathways to the development of the shadow</a>
00:04:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h04m28s">And they're tightly allied with one another</a>
00:04:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h04m31s">The fundamental pathway is truth</a>
00:04:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h04m33s">And that's to face the bitter truth about yourself</a>
00:04:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h04m36s">To break that down more particularly you might think about that</a>
00:04:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h04m39s">As the capacity to observe your own resentment</a>
00:04:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h04m43s">You're going to be resentful and bitter in many situations</a>
00:04:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h04m46s">Because you don't get what you want</a>
00:04:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h04m48s">And if you watch that resentment and bitterness you'll see that</a>
00:04:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h04m50s">It produces fantasies that can be unbelievably dark</a>
00:04:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h04m54s">And that can be very frightning</a>
00:04:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h04m55s">You might not want to admit to yourself that you're actually capable of having fantasies like that</a>
00:04:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h05m00s">Or impulses like that or aggressive feelings like that</a>
00:05:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h05m04s">If those aggressive feelings and impulses and fantasies are integrated into your character</a>
00:05:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h05m11s">It's like you're opening up a dialogue with a part of yourself that can be very forceful and strong</a>
00:05:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h05m16s">And dangerous
And it's really usefull to be dangerous</a>
00:05:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h05m20s">Because if you can be dangerous, you often don't have to be</a>
00:05:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h05m24s">And it's often weak people, for example it's weak men who generally rape</a>
00:05:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h05m29s">That's a very common occurrence</a>
00:05:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h05m31s">And it's a very violent act, but it's borne out of weakness not out of strength, that's for sure</a>
00:05:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h05m37s">You attend to your resentment honestly</a>
00:05:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h05m40s">And you observe yourself and what you're actually like</a>
00:05:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h05m42s">You gotta pay attention as if you don't know yourself</a>
00:05:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h05m44s">As if you might harbor hidden devils
And then maybe they'll emerge</a>
00:05:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h05m49s">Jung also felt that sort of embedded inside the shadow were the contrasexual tendencies</a>
00:05:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h05m53s">And so for example</a>
00:05:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h05m55s">Sometimes you see people are well developed</a>
00:05:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h05m57s">Men, let's say, and we can also talk about women in this regard</a>
00:05:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h06m02s">Men who've integrated their shadow also often develop a kind of peculiar grace</a>
00:06:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h06m06s">That would be a consequence of not only allowing their aggressive side to step forward</a>
00:06:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h06m11s">But also their feminine and compassionate side</a>
00:06:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h06m15s">That they may have kept squelcht because of embarrassment about it</a>
00:06:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h06m18s">Or because they may have been harassed for being weak or any number of things</a>
00:06:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h06m21s">But the practical approach for developing your shadow, I would say</a>
00:06:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h06m24s">Is to contemplate and consider your resentment</a>
00:06:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h06m29s">And notice what it says</a>
00:06:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h06m30s">Because your resentment will also tell you what you have to say</a>
00:06:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h06m34s">So look at what happened at Google this weekend</a>
00:06:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h06m37s">Jame Damore wrote that memo and you can imagine he was pretty angry</a>
00:06:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h06m41s">And perhaps even some what resentful</a>
00:06:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h06m43s">at having to attend that diversity seminar</a>
00:06:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h06m45s">I am really just using it as an example</a>
00:06:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h06m48s">But, what he did was to decide that that man</a>
00:06:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h06m50s">he had something he had to say</a>
00:06:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h06m53s">Look at the consequences of that, man</a>
00:06:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h06m55s">It is absolutely unbelievable</a>
00:06:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h06m56s">And so you know if you are feeling oppressed at work or</a>
00:06:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h06m58s">You are oppressed in your life</a>
00:06:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h07m01s">Or you are oppressing yourself</a>
00:07:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h07m03s">Then you gonna notice that you are feeling oppressed</a>
00:07:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h07m05s">Then you have to notice that you are feeling resentful and angry</a>
00:07:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h07m09s">and bitter and maybe even like Cain</a>
00:07:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h07m11s">The story of Cain enable</a>
00:07:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h07m12s">Because Cain is the sort of archetypal  bitter man</a>
00:07:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h07m15s">And you have to decide what is you need to do in order to remove from yourself that bitterness</a>
00:07:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h07m20s">And that usually means that there is something you have to say</a>
00:07:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h07m23s">And you have to say it</a>
00:07:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h07m24s">Because your soul depends on it</a>
00:07:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h07m26s">And it is not only your soul that depends on it</a>
00:07:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h07m28s">I would like to say the fate of the world depends on it</a>
00:07:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h07m30s">Because you might be wrong and then you should be straight out, or maybe you are just being wining,</a>
00:07:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h07m35s">You have to talk to somebody about that</a>
00:07:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h07m37s">Or maybe you are actually detecting something wrong</a>
00:07:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h07m40s">Some tearing is directed towards you and another people</a>
00:07:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h07m42s">And it is like your moral obligation to speak up about it</a>
00:07:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h07m45s">And so many world places become toxic used the terrible cliche</a>
00:07:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h07m50s">Because the people in them won't speak up for what they actually want</a>
00:07:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h07m53s">Or they speak up too late and then they are all twisted up about it</a>
00:07:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h07m57s">And you know they torturing other people</a>
00:07:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h07m58s">Because they are so unhappy and so forth and so on</a>
00:07:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h08m01s">So</a>
00:08:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h08m02s">Practical approach for developing shadow fundamentally is radical honesty</a>
00:08:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc#t=00h08m07s">Jung said that genuine moral effort was a good substitute for psychotherapy.</a>
