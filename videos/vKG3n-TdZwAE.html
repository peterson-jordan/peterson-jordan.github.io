00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h00m09s">then there is the possibility that you can sort things out again,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h00m21s">You can imagine this symbolically as the existence of the deceased father at the bottom of the Landscape of Chaos,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h00m31s">That's the right way, as far as I'm aware, of thinking about it.</a>
00:00:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h00m35s">It is as if there is something down there that has the capacity to recover and rise again.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h00m41s">It is as if this entity incorporates the previous state of affairs yet takes it further.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h00m45s">And you ain't gonna find that unless you descend into the chaotic valley,</a>
00:00:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h00m49s">where you feel that all order is gone.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h01m24s">It is chaotic because you have not quite found your place in the world yet.</a>
00:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h01m28s">And I don't mean career only</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h01m31s">- not that it is completely irrelevant, because it does matter -,</a>
00:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h01m33s">but it is more important than just the fact that you have not yet completed a career;</a>
00:01:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h01m35s">for you are a historical creature, for you are a result of history.</a>
00:01:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h01m40s">Unless you've been properly incubated,</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h01m44s">which means that you have a deep understanding of your past,</a>
00:01:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h01m47s">in the sense that the humanities can arm you with that concept,</a>
00:01:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h01m50s">then you have not been able to incorporate the wisdom of your ancestors into your daily activities.</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h02m01s">And that's going to make you weak.</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h02m02s">At least that's the idea.</a>
00:02:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h02m04s">So when you come to college ...</a>
00:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h02m07s">This is the aim of the university:</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h02m09s">it exists so that you can throw yourself into chaos and extrapolate something valuable from it.</a>
00:02:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h02m15s">And you can incorporate that into your own personality,</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h02m18s">and that makes you immensely more unruly.</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h02m20s">"More unruly" as in literally more unruly, not simply "higher educated".</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h02m29s">'Better' means: you can do many more things, you can articulate yourself better ...</a>
00:02:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h02m32s">That is something that is crucial, that you can articulate yourself properly.</a>
00:02:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h02m37s">That's more convenient than anything you could possibly achieve.</a>

00:02:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h02m43s">with the skills to formulate coherent arguments and use language correctly,</a>
00:02:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h02m49s">then you own the toolkit to be so influential it's bizarre.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h02m52s">Regardless of the circumstances ...</a>
00:02:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h02m55s">You can always draw up a strategy and implement it successfully.</a>
00:02:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h02m59s">And maybe the strategy is oriented towards something good, something that will work seriously.</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h03m03s">Working for you, and working for others at the same time.</a>
00:03:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h03m05s">I don't really understand why people aren't told this when they come to college.</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h03m11s">Your goal is to make yourself as articulate in writing, and thinking, and speaking as you can get.</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h03m19s">Because that opens the door to everything you want to do in the future, no matter what it is.</a>
00:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h03m25s">The better-discussed individual always ascends.</a>

00:03:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h03m43s">Moreover, it does not convince people thoroughly.</a>
00:03:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h03m46s">No one can deal effectively with potential that lies in the perspective.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h03m51s">No one can defend himself against criticism.</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h03m56s">So that all goes to the past - to the chaos of the past, you could even say -,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h04m18s">And that's not so good, because if you are powerless in the face of the Tragedy of Life,</a>
00:04:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h04m25s">then you will be harmed much more than you would have been if it had turned out differently,</a>
00:04:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h04m27s">and ditto for the people around you.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3n-TdZwAE#t=00h04m29s">And then the likelihood that you will get resentful and bitter about that is very high,</a>
