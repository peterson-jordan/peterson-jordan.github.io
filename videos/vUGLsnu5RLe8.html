00:00:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h00m15s">I'm going to start by giving you an overview of</a>
00:00:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h00m19s">the content of the lecture. Then I will give you an overview of the requirements</a>
00:00:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h00m25s">at the end. But let's just start with the content right away.</a>
00:00:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h00m30s">There is a website, I don't like "blackboard," so I have my own website.</a>
00:00:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h00m37s">You can go to jordanbpeterson.com, and there you will find a menu that lists all courses</a>
00:00:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h00m45s">and displays the full study guide. So all the information you will need</a>
00:00:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h00m50s">about the lecture you can find there, including most of the reading material.</a>
00:00:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h00m55s">But there is also a book, I assume the majority of you have already purchased it.</a>
00:00:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h01m02s">It also lists the other things you need to know, such as which days the tests will take place,</a>
00:01:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h01m07s">what the assignments are, but I'll cover that at the end of the lesson.</a>
00:01:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h01m14s">To begin with, I will tell you what the college is about so that you can decide</a>
00:01:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h01m18s">whether that is something for you or not.</a>
00:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h01m24s">Personality theory is a peculiar domain within psychology because it has a number</a>
00:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h01m35s">includes sub-disciplines that are not particularly well matched.</a>
00:01:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h01m45s">For example, it includes clinical psychology and experimental psychology.</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h01m56s">It also includes an approach that is fundamentally individual, and an approach that is</a>
00:01:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h02m06s">analyze individual traits in large groups, which is what you usually have to do in experimental psychology.</a>
00:02:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h02m12s">It's also a strange hybrid of philosophy,</a>
00:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h02m22s">architecture, medicine and science. You could think of medicine as a science</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h02m30s">but it is not, because it is about promoting health,</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h02m35s">and health is not a scientific category. It is a necessary category</a>
00:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h02m40s">determined by values. For you have to decide what constitutes health, and what constitutes disease.</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h02m47s">Or what constitutes well-being, and what constitutes pathology. And you can't possibly do that</a>
00:02:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h02m51s">without making value judgments.</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h02m53s">That's especially true of psychology, because when you think about what's healthy</a>
00:02:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h02m59s">personality, you usually don't just think about the absence of pathology.</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h03m04s">You think about the presence of positive characteristics. Someone who is completely healthy,</a>
00:03:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h03m09s">Mentally and physically. The psychologists, especially the humanistic psychologists</a>
00:03:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h03m14s">from the 1960s, see a person as truly mentally healthy when he has realized himself.</a>
00:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h03m19s">That means he is full</a>
00:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h03m23s">has developed positive potential, whatever that may be. Because of these idiosyncrasies, personality theory,</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h03m32s">a lecture on personality theory should cover a great deal.</a>
00:03:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h03m38s">So this college is very broad. Elements of cultural history are treated,</a>
00:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h03m47s">elements of moral philosophy, and elements that I believe are almost entirely biological.</a>
00:03:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h03m55s">That way, it gives you a multidimensional view of what it means to</a>
00:03:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h04m01s">to be human.</a>
00:04:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h04m02s">I also have some other guidelines that I follow while teaching this lecture.</a>
00:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h04m06s">One of them is that I don't want to tell you anything that I think is</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h04m11s">is not useful to you. There is a difference between a fact and a useful fact.</a>
00:04:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h04m17s">There are many facts, you can drown in facts with Google.</a>
00:04:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h04m21s">Undoubtedly you do that every day. But a useful fact transforms the way</a>
00:04:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h04m28s">you see the world, or the way you act, in a way that you</a>
00:04:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h04m33s">helpful. So another way of describing useful is as relevant.</a>
00:04:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h04m41s">One of the guidelines I follow is that I don't want to teach you anything</a>
00:04:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h04m44s">that is irrelevant. And my criteria for being relevant, first: does it help you</a>
00:04:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h04m51s">in person? Are the things you learn immediately meaningful to how</a>
00:04:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h04m56s">you act in your life? And second: are there any indications that the facts you</a>
00:04:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h05m01s">will be provided, be of social benefit,</a>
00:05:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h05m06s">or political or economic usefulness? So that your knowledge makes a difference</a>
00:05:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h05m10s">in the way you act, and that, that also affects the people around you.</a>
00:05:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h05m16s">For those various reasons, I have compiled this material.</a>
00:05:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h05m26s">That means you have to take into account a number of things,</a>
00:05:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h05m34s">before you enroll in this college. And there is another lecture on personality theory,</a>
00:05:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h05m40s">at the same time. At least in this semester. It could be that, that college</a>
00:05:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h05m44s">suits you better than this college. But I can tell you how this college will be</a>
00:05:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h05m48s">expired. So if that's not what you want, or if you're not there</a>
00:05:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h05m52s">interested, you should not attend this lecture. First</a>
00:05:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h05m56s">you have to read a lot. It's less than what it used to be</a>
00:05:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h06m00s">but it is still a lot. And much of it is original</a>
00:06:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h06m06s">material, both from the personality theorists and</a>
00:06:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h06m13s">of the empirical pieces. So it's not just a lot of reading,</a>
00:06:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h06m17s">but it is quite difficult reading. I think it is useful, according to</a>
00:06:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h06m23s">the definition I have given. I think read what I offer you</a>
00:06:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h06m28s">will be good for you. But if you don't have time to read a lot</a>
00:06:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h06m34s">you will find college frustrating.</a>
00:06:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h06m37s">Because of its emphasis on clinical theorists, that's important</a>
00:06:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h06m45s">is part of personality theory, in particular classical personality theory,</a>
00:06:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h06m50s">the elements of personality theory that students are generally most interested in,</a>
00:06:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h06m54s">there is a lot of philosophical material. And it is philosophical</a>
00:06:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h07m00s">because it's about how a person should live. And that's one</a>
00:07:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h07m06s">very different question than what a person is. How someone should live</a>
00:07:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h07m10s">or how someone can transform themselves, or act to transform themselves</a>
00:07:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h07m16s">so that his personality becomes, so to speak, "better." You can use "healthier"</a>
00:07:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h07m22s">instead of better, but in the context we are talking about,</a>
00:07:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h07m26s">is that difference trivial.</a>
00:07:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h07m29s">The last thing I want to warn you about is that I don't lecture on the basis of</a>
00:07:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h07m35s">the reading material. Often I will not know exactly what I am going to tell you</a>
00:07:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h07m42s">when I come to class. I know the material, but I don't want to get stuck on a prescribed schedule.</a>
00:07:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h07m50s">I want to talk to you about things that are important to me. With a bit of luck</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h07m55s">the lectures will therefore be worthwhile to attend and listen to. But if you need more</a>
00:07:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h08m02s">have the need, from your temperament, for a college where things hurt</a>

00:11:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h11m38s">I would say it is as important as language.</a>

00:11:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h12m05s">because once you can imitate, you can use your body as a means of representation</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h12m10s">to represent the world and other people. You can even use your body as a representation</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h12m16s">of yourself. For example, what you do when you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h12m31s">to construct models of the world that are well articulated, that you can exchange with other people, and that makes it possible to think.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h12m37s">To have self-awareness you must be able to recognize that you exist</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h13m09s">of each other and the world, but we can also store those articulated representations</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h13m25s">which are, in a sense, an articulate representation of bodily action. Because you can see a story</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLsnu5RLe8#t=00h13m31s">like drama. A drama is behavior that represents behavior. And a story is</a>
