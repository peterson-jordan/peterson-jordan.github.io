<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dwsYWF7TXI#t=00h03m45s">Hitler comes along and he's he's a very powerful emotional orator, and he's watching the crowd</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dwsYWF7TXI#t=00h03m51s">And he listens and when he says thing eh nothing happens</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dwsYWF7TXI#t=00h03m56s">When he says thing B</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dwsYWF7TXI#t=00h03m58s">Everybody roars and so he takes note of that and it's not even</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dwsYWF7TXI#t=00h04m01s">Conscious exactly right because he's being molded by the crowd and so they roar and so II think so that's a reinforcement</a>
00:04:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dwsYWF7TXI#t=00h04m08s">That's a reward and so then he goes down that line a little bit farther</a>
00:04:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dwsYWF7TXI#t=00h04m12s">And they roar some more and then he tries something else and it's silent</a>

00:04:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dwsYWF7TXI#t=00h04m21s">So he becomes the embodiment of the dark desire of the mob, and that's partly that's partly why he had the charisma</a>
00:04:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dwsYWF7TXI#t=00h04m28s">It's right because there's this unconscious</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dwsYWF7TXI#t=00h04m48s">he he embodied that fully you know and you could say so what happened was a</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dwsYWF7TXI#t=00h04m53s">Collaboration between him and the people it wasn't Hitler turned everyone into Nazis. It's like no that's not how it worked</a>
00:04:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dwsYWF7TXI#t=00h05m00s">I'm sure there was a lot of good people still left over who got just overrun by the mania - well, we're disgusted</a>
