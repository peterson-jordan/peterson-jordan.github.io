00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h00m05s">Physically and so you look at this you've got wall number one, and then you have wall number two</a>
00:00:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h00m09s">But then inside the walls you have walls around everything. All these houses are walls and inside the houses</a>
00:00:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h00m15s">There are walls as well</a>
00:00:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h00m16s">And so everything is and what you do when you put walls around things as you make part of the world simpler, right?</a>
00:00:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h00m23s">Constantly if the reason you have house is so that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h00m29s">You just want those few people that you can barely tolerate in your house</a>
00:00:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h00m33s">And not all those other strangers and god only knows what they're gonna do.</a>
00:00:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h00m36s">You'll still invite people in now and then?</a>
00:00:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h00m39s">Because maybe you're sick and tired and bored of the people that are in your house</a>
00:00:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h00m42s">And so you want a little bit of new information, but you want those barriers to be there so that you can</a>
00:00:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h00m48s">voluntarily modulates the information flow</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h00m51s">Okay, so that's the first thing you do and you know then you set up rules with everybody else it says, "well</a>
00:00:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h00m56s">I'm gonna have some walls so you can't come in, but what I'm gonna</a>
00:00:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h01m00s">do is pay you for that privilege by letting you have some walls where people can't come in" and</a>
00:01:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h01m05s">so I think that's analogous I was thinking about</a>
00:01:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h01m09s">The issue of discrimination in relationship to sex because I've been thinking a lot about discrimination lately because everybody thinks discrimination is a bad idea</a>
00:01:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h01m16s">which is a very stupid proposition because you're</a>
00:01:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h01m19s">discriminating all the time and the most fundamental form of discrimination is choice of sexual partner and so you might say, "well</a>
00:01:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h01m27s">Why should that even be allowed?"</a>
00:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h01m28s">Because it is the most fundamental form of discrimination so for example</a>
00:01:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h01m32s">almost everyone is racially prejudiced when it comes to sexual partners</a>
00:01:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h01m37s">So you think well is that right is that a what about are you to use age as an exclusionary criteria?</a>
00:01:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h01m44s">Probably. to use physical attractiveness only insofar as you're able</a>
00:01:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h01m49s">Right you use it completely if you could get away with it, roughly speaking</a>
00:01:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h01m53s">But you can't because the most attractive people aren't going to be anywhere near you so you can't do it</a>
00:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h01m58s">but you'd like to. Health? yes. Strength? Yes. Wealth? yes. Education?</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h02m03s">definitely!</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h02m05s">So you it's unbelievably discriminatory, and so you might say well. Why is that?</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h02m10s">Justifiable, and it seems to me that it's something like</a>
00:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h02m15s">Well you get to say no to me if I get to say no to you, it's something like that</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h02m20s">We've agreed that everybody gets to discriminate on that basis and because everybody can do it then it's fair</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h02m26s">It's something like that. It's very much worth thinking about</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h02m30s">You know, I don't know if you know this but, in Huxley's book brave new world where the family had been completely demolished rated</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h02m37s">children were</a>
00:02:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h02m38s">conceived in</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h02m39s">bottles and given and produced in factories so the whole idea of the relationship between</a>
00:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h02m45s">sex and procreation had become a taboo</a>
00:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h02m48s">one of the</a>
00:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h02m51s">mantras, the slogans of the society was everyone belongs to everyone else and</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h02m56s">so it was actually a social faux pas to</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h03m00s">Refuse to sleep with someone just as it was a social faux pas to have any exclusionary relationship</a>
00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h03m06s">Because another thing that you might notice is that there's nothing more discriminatory than falling in love with someone. It's like, you're</a>
00:03:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h03m12s">special and all the rest of you? Hahaha, No! So it's the ultimate</a>
00:03:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h03m17s">exclusionary act right and yet we presume that that's an acceptable</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h03m21s">Not only acceptable. We demand that as a as a right and well. That's we're thinking about a lot.</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h03m28s">Anyway, it's okay, so what you're doing is</a>
00:03:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h03m32s">by by agreeing to this</a>
00:03:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h03m35s">segregation and boxing what you're doing is</a>
00:03:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h03m37s">carving off little bits of the world that are simple enough so that someone like you can live for some amount of time there without</a>
00:03:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h03m43s">too much danger and everyone agrees to do that, roughly speaking, because everybody needs to engage in that process</a>
00:03:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h03m50s">of simplification and</a>
00:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h03m52s">safety provision and so so we have towns and the towns are nothing but boxes inside boxes</a>
00:03:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h03m59s">So there's a good, you know, a good schematic of a little</a>
00:03:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h04m03s">house, and you can see that even inside the same place we segregate off rooms for different purposes</a>
00:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h04m09s">and then what's interesting too is that we set up those rooms as</a>
00:04:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h04m13s">Little dramatic spaces right so you furnish them and you furnish them with things that tell you how to behave in that room</a>
00:04:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h04m20s">So the table and chairs tells you that's where you're going to eat</a>
00:04:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h04m23s">And that's where people are going to sit and they're roughly going just they're going to sit facing each other that has certain implications</a>
00:04:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h04m29s">Because the chairs don't face the walls, they face each other and you have a living room where it's comfortable</a>
00:04:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h04m33s">And there's a fire and you know you're setting up little stages basically</a>
00:04:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h04m37s">So that just like kids do when they pretend you know they all assign each other roles</a>
00:04:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h04m41s">And then they lay out a little drama, and that's what you do when you invite someone over or well</a>
00:04:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h04m46s">Let's sit in the living room well</a>
00:04:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h04m48s">you probably get a drink if you sit in the living room, and hypothetically you're gonna have some conversation and</a>
00:04:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h04m53s">,so, it's a bounded place</a>
00:04:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h04m54s">There are rules that apply, and then you get to have a little exploration inside that set of bounded rules</a>
00:04:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h05m00s">And if you're open you're gonna discuss all sorts of things and if you're conservative</a>
00:05:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h05m05s">and closed, then you're gonna discuss a very very small subset of things and so hopefully everyone will agree on that</a>
00:05:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h05m13s">So that's one form of binding, then another is, well,</a>
00:05:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h05m17s">we we put boxes around each other when it comes to groups and so this is a I think this is a picture from the</a>
00:05:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h05m24s">from the Democratic convention</a>
00:05:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h05m26s">When Obama was elected, if I remember correctly</a>
00:05:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h05m31s">But anyways what happens is that people segregate themselves into little micro groups like Democrats and Republicans</a>
00:05:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h05m37s">And they basically do that on a temperamental grounds, right? fundamentally. And they and then they produce these</a>
00:05:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h05m44s">these games that everyone knows how to play and that's another form of</a>
00:05:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h05m50s">simplification so when you bring all these people</a>
00:05:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h05m53s">together at a political convention</a>
00:05:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ0EU5gpqIQ#t=00h05m56s">It's not like they all have the same ideas ,they don't, and it could degenerate into chaos and sometimes that happens you get big</a>
00:05:56</p>
