<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3XYHPAwBzE#t=00h00m07s">societies, I believe pretty much everywhere it is being studied. Now,</a>
00:00:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3XYHPAwBzE#t=00h00m12s">you can calculate an index called the Gini Coefficient, and the Gini Coefficient is a number that represents</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3XYHPAwBzE#t=00h00m23s">geographical area. So, you could calculate a gini coefficient for a street, or</a>

00:00:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3XYHPAwBzE#t=00h00m35s">what you find is --you always hear this idea that poverty causes crime:</a>
00:00:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3XYHPAwBzE#t=00h00m39s">that's a classic left-wing idea-- but it's wrong. It's seriously wrong, and it's importantly wrong, and it's</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3XYHPAwBzE#t=00h00m48s">definitively wrong not only that. So there's no argument about this, it's already been established.</a>
00:00:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3XYHPAwBzE#t=00h00m53s">What causes crime -especially aggressive crime- is relative poverty.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3XYHPAwBzE#t=00h00m58s">Relative poverty is not the same thing as Poverty, at all;</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3XYHPAwBzE#t=00h01m01s">It's seriously not the same thing. Poverty is when you don't have enough to eat</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3XYHPAwBzE#t=00h01m05s">Relative poverty is when the guy next door has a much better car than you.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3XYHPAwBzE#t=00h01m09s">So, there's lots of relative poverty in the United States, and there's some absolute poverty; but even the absolute poverty in the United States</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3XYHPAwBzE#t=00h01m17s">is nothing like the absolute poverty in places like India or in sub-Saharan Africa, where absolute poverty means you have nothing.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3XYHPAwBzE#t=00h01m24s">Now, what's really interesting about the Gini Coefficient, Is that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3XYHPAwBzE#t=00h01m54s">then there's almost no crime; but if you go places where there are poor people,</a>
