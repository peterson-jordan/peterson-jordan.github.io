00:00:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h00m17s">Especially the cartoon bear named SMOKEY, he always wanted to prevent forest fires</a>
00:00:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h00m22s">Because the fire will burn the forest, which is not a good thing</a>
00:00:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h00m27s">But if you blindly avoid forest fires, the price is</a>
00:00:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h00m31s">The forest has a lot of dry branches, right</a>
00:00:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h00m35s">Because the branches will wither</a>
00:00:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h00m37s">The wood fell on the woodland, the more piles, the more</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h00m49s">But if it’s piled up too much and dry</a>
00:00:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h00m54s">It burns again, that's a big problem</a>
00:00:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h00m57s">The temperature of the forest fire is so high that the topsoil is completely burned by the fire.</a>
00:00:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h01m03s">This kind of fire made the forest no longer exist, leaving only a desert</a>
00:01:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h01m07s">Many tree species have evolved and can resist low-intensity fires</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h01m20s">Can prevent the fire from destroying all the forest</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h01m22s">This is also a very useful metaphor of life, a metaphor about sacrifice, observed from nature</a>
00:01:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h01m29s">It’s much easier when you sacrifice something voluntarily</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h01m34s">Because you have judged that it is a weakness and want to get rid of it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h01m43s">It’s also much easier than being forced, because you’re likely to resist</a>
00:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h01m48s">There is also a very interesting motive, which is implemented throughout the Bible, a powerful motive</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h01m55s">Is the concept of walking with God or living according to God’s will</a>
00:01:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h02m00s">In the New Testament, Christ mentioned</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h02m10s">I may not be as accurate as the scripture, but it is roughly the same</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h02m16s">Besides, the "personality" that many people are proud of</a>
00:02:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h02m21s">The ones they are proud of are not their own personalities at all</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h02m24s">It's just some unnecessary weird actions</a>
00:02:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h02m27s">Make them look slightly different from others</a>
00:02:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h02m32s">Those "characteristics" have no value, they seem to be funny</a>
00:02:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h02m36s">I thought of trying to teach a stubborn student to write before</a>
00:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h02m42s">She wrote many short essays in college</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h02m45s">As a result, every article after correction was terrible</a>
00:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h02m50s">The reason is that she can't write articles</a>
00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h02m52s">She really doesn’t know how to write articles, really, really bad</a>
00:02:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h02m56s">I was sitting and trying to explain to her where she was wrong</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h03m02s">She is very bored, she does not follow the rules, very unwilling to listen</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h03m07s">Somewhat similar to the situation in the Bible where the pearl was ruined by a pig</a>
00:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h03m11s">Later, she said, "There is nothing wrong with my article, but the professors in the university don't like my style."</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h03m17s">I can feel my hands reaching out to pinch her neck</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h03m24s">It’s funny enough even if it’s me, but it really happened</a>
00:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h03m28s">I thought, "What's wrong with you?"</a>
00:03:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h03m30s">"You can't even write, still think you have a style?"</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h03m34s">Not just that</a>
00:03:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h03m41s">Not being able to write doesn’t mean you have style, this is another important point, right?</a>
00:03:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h03m46s">So you know</a>
00:03:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h03m48s">Not only is she not humble, it is necessary and reasonable for freshmen</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h03m53s">Of course you can't write, when will you learn? At school?</a>
00:03:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h03m56s">I don't think so</a>
00:03:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h04m03s">Well, she has this kind of problem</a>
00:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h04m06s">"Style" issue and no progress at all</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h04m10s">right now</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h04m12s">Let me think about it, I forgot what I just wanted to say, it was all the jokes</a>
00:04:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h04m17s">By the way, it’s about burning things, that’s right</a>
00:04:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h04m21s">She is proud of her shortcomings</a>
00:04:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h04m23s">This is arrogance, right, not modesty, self-deception, and arrogance</a>
00:04:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h04m27s">It is foolish to be proud of one's shortcomings</a>
00:04:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h04m29s">It's like reluctant to let go of my dead part</a>
00:04:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h04m32s">There is a truth, to implement the whole Bible, which is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h04m42s">That’s it, I’ll tell you another story, I read Socrates in the morning</a>
00:04:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h04m46s">I read the story of Socrates' trial</a>
00:04:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h04m50s">He was tried by the Athenians</a>
00:04:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h04m52s">Because he broke it, because he worshiped the wrong god</a>
00:04:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h04m56s">He was accused of taking the young man in Athens</a>
00:04:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h04m58s">Because he teaches them and asks students questions</a>
00:04:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h05m02s">Stimulating people to think is indeed easy to bring bad people</a>
00:05:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h05m04s">He knew the court day was getting closer</a>
00:05:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h05m07s">Athens is not big, about 25,000 people</a>
00:05:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h05m11s">Everyone knows each other and everyone knows who is the big one</a>
00:05:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h05m13s">Everyone, including Socrates knows</a>
00:05:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h05m17s">The news of the trial is more like a warning</a>
00:05:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h05m19s">I want you to flash people now</a>
00:05:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h05m21s">You will be summoned in half a year and you may be sentenced to death</a>
00:05:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h05m26s">Like this, understand</a>
00:05:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h05m28s">So, Socrates talked with his friends</a>
00:05:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h05m32s">They helped Socrates think of some ways to defend</a>
00:05:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h05m37s">Or help him escape so that he won’t be judged and killed</a>
00:05:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h05m42s">Then Socrates decided he didn’t want those</a>
00:05:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h05m46s">He doesn't even want to think about defense</a>
00:05:46</p>

00:05:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h05m55s">He told a friend</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h05m59s">There is a voice in his head that will speak to him</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h06m02s">A devil or god, or something</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h06m07s">He always listens to that voice</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h06m09s">This is one of the reasons why he is so outstanding, because he listens to this voice</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h06m12s">It doesn’t tell him what to do, it tells him not to do</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h06m16s">If the voice tells him not to do something, he will not do it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h06m18s">If he is talking</a>
00:06:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h06m20s">And the little voice said, "No, stop talking."</a>
00:06:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h06m23s">Then he will shut up and try to say something else</a>
00:06:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h06m26s">He is very decisive about this</a>
00:06:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h06m28s">He said that when he planned to avoid trial, even just to defend himself</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h06m35s">The voice said, "No."</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h06m40s">He thought, what the hell is this</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h06m45s">The trial is coming, I will be killed</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h06m48s">Finally he concluded that he is an old man</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h06m59s">Maybe the gods are giving him a chance to exit</a>
00:06:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h07m03s">So that he can arrange his funeral and say goodbye to his friends and family</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h07m27s">Of course, Socrates is an amazing man</a>

00:07:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h07m41s">When you improve your goals</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h07m55s">Even if it is such a concept</a>
00:07:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h07m57s">This thing will become a judge</a>
00:07:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h07m59s">It's higher than you, right</a>
00:07:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h08m01s">Maybe you're scared to death</a>
00:08:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h08m04s">The same reason you are afraid when you start a new job</a>
00:08:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h08m07s">Because it's above you</a>
00:08:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h08m09s">So you are afraid of it and it is criticizing you</a>
00:08:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h08m11s">But this is very useful because the judge you created with ideals</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h08m16s">It can tell you what are your useless parts</a>
00:08:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h08m19s">You can give them up</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h08m21s">You have to repeat this step, every time you create a higher judge</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h08m25s">More useless selves must be discarded</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h08m28s">Finally you create the ultimate judge, a classic example imagined by humans</a>

00:08:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h08m36s">Because even if Christ has no divinity, at least he is a typical, perfect person, the highest judge</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h08m42s">The judge said</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h08m47s">Of course this is what God said to Abraham</a>
00:08:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h08m51s">He wants him to be perfect, to set a high enough ideal</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h08m55s">I think this thing is interesting because you can do this by yourself</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h08m59s">Cooperating with other people is inevitable, but you don’t have to treat outsiders as your ideals</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h09m19s">Then you will have a judge</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h09m23s">Why don’t people raise the standard and be aggressive</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUywkaYTQ8Y#t=00h09m44s">Far better than getting rid of it</a>
