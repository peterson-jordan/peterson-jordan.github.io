00:00:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h00m07s">That is why I sent a link in my email to the other lecture I would be teaching,</a>
00:00:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h00m12s">but I have to go to a conference Thursday and Friday, so I will give the final talk today.</a>
00:00:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h00m17s">And you can check out last year's penultimate lecture, which hopefully gets the material right</a>
00:00:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h00m24s">enough treats.</a>
00:00:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h00m27s">I usually use the last lesson to summarize what we have discussed, and also to talk about ...</a>
00:00:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h00m34s">let me open this… about my more specific thoughts about it</a>
00:00:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h00m44s">personality.</a>
00:00:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h00m48s">So that's, I guess, what I'm going to do today.</a>
00:00:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h01m28s">I'll start with what we've covered.</a>
00:01:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h01m40s">I started by discussing mythological representations of personality,</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h01m53s">and I had several reasons for this, but the most important was for the rest of the profession</a>
00:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h02m00s">in a thorough historical context.</a>
00:02:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h02m05s">Because personality is the result of many things.</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h02m11s">And many of them are anchored in our biology and thus in evolution.</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h02m19s">And I think social science in general doesn't take evolution seriously enough.</a>
00:02:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h02m27s">They don't take the fact that we are three and a half billion years old seriously enough.</a>
00:02:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h02m34s">This is important.</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h02m37s">And for some things that is evident in a, conceptually, quite simple way,</a>
00:02:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h02m45s">namely that we share a large part of our biological soil with other creatures.</a>
00:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h02m50s">There was a genetic analysis of gorillas recently.</a>
00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h02m57s">And I don't remember what percentage of our DNA we share with gorillas,</a>
00:02:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h03m01s">but it's something like 99.2 percent, which is pretty shocking. Until you realize</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h03m05s">that we share about seventy of our genetic makeup with yeast.</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h03m10s">So yes, of course we are much closer to gorillas than yeast, but we are still standing</a>
00:03:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h03m16s">particularly close to yeast.</a>
00:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h03m18s">And it also indicates, not only how much we resemble gorillas, but also</a>
00:03:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h03m26s">how small genetic modifications bring about substantial changes. Because as much as we look like gorillas</a>
00:03:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h03m32s">we also differ significantly.</a>
00:03:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h03m38s">So there is the biological aspect, which is very important.</a>
00:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h03m44s">But then there is something you can describe as a “quasi-biological” element,</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h03m48s">that seems to operate in the space between biology as evolutionarily determined and culture.</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h03m56s">Those things are often ... we have an archetypal tendency to think of culture as</a>
00:03:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h04m02s">something opposite to nature.</a>
00:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h04m06s">And that is useful from a heuristic perspective.</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h04m09s">You can do a lot with that distinction from a conceptual perspective.</a>
00:04:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h04m13s">But it is misleading in many ways.</a>
00:04:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h04m18s">Because some of the fundamental elements of culture are biological.</a>
00:04:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h04m23s">I think the most striking example of that… there are two striking examples.</a>
00:04:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h04m31s">One is the existence of power structures, or authority structures, or structures of influence:</a>
00:04:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h04m39s">hierarchies that are incredibly old, at least four hundred million years old.</a>
00:04:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h04m48s">And which have subsequently been present for so long that you are also part of it</a>
00:04:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h04m54s">must consider the environment, part of nature.</a>
00:04:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h04m58s">For we tend to view the hierarchical structure as cultural, and</a>
00:04:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h05m05s">in a sense as easy to change.</a>
00:05:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h05m07s">But we have no reason to think that way since, as I noted in another lesson,</a>
00:05:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h05m12s">is present longer than trees.</a>
00:05:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h05m16s">It is a very constant element of the environment in which people find themselves.</a>
00:05:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h05m23s">Such that… you can think of a social hierarchy as the prototype</a>
00:05:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h05m27s">of culture. But since it has been a constant factor of the environment since time immemorial,</a>
00:05:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h05m34s">our nervous systems are set up to function within a hierarchy, and that's how they are actually built.</a>
00:05:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h05m39s">It's not an afterthought.</a>
00:05:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h05m41s">Because the serotonin system that regulates our emotions, that's what</a>
00:05:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h05m47s">The serotonin system essentially does, which is also the system that our brains make up during fetal development.</a>
00:05:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h05m53s">The serotonin system is perhaps above all concerned with tuning your nervous system</a>
00:05:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h06m00s">in accordance with your position in a hierarchy.</a>
00:06:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h06m03s">And the basic rule is: the higher you are in a hierarchy, the less negative emotions you need to feel.</a>
00:06:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h06m11s">And the lower you are in the hierarchy, and the more difficult your life actually is</a>
00:06:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h06m17s">(because there is a direct relationship between how hard your life is and your position</a>
00:06:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h06m21s">in the social hierarchy), the more negative emotions you will feel.</a>
00:06:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h06m25s">And that has drastic consequences, which are clearly visible in life expectancy.</a>
00:06:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h06m32s">There was a famous survey called the “Whitehall Survey,” conducted in Great Britain.</a>
00:06:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h06m37s">And what they looked at was health, including death rates, among English officials.</a>
00:06:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h06m47s">The first survey was conducted fifty years before the second.</a>
00:06:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h06m51s">I think the second study was done in the 1980s.</a>
00:06:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h06m54s">Either way, in the first survey, there is a power hierarchy, with the senior officials at the top</a>
00:06:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h07m00s">and the lower officials below.</a>
00:07:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h07m03s">You can ask yourself what is high and low, and you can partly understand it</a>
00:07:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h07m11s">as the autonomy to make choices.</a>
00:07:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h07m15s">That is part, you can make choices that give you more control</a>
00:07:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h07m19s">about what will happen to you.</a>
00:07:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h07m21s">It is also the case that you are more likely to have a stable and productive workplace</a>
00:07:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h07m26s">when you go up, and get smaller when you go down.</a>
00:07:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h07m29s">And the result of that, all in all, was the officials at the bottom</a>
00:07:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h07m33s">the social hierarchy died younger and more often than the senior officials.</a>
00:07:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h07m40s">You could attribute that to poverty, because the people at the bottom, certainly in</a>
00:07:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h07m46s">the 1930s, were materially disadvantaged compared to the people at the top.</a>
00:07:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h07m51s">Although they were not disadvantaged compared to Britons a hundred years earlier</a>
00:07:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h07m57s">were alive, or compared to most people in the world at the time.</a>
00:07:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h08m01s">So it's hard to say it was a matter of poverty, but it's easier to say it was a matter of relative poverty.</a>
00:08:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h08m07s">But fifty years later, Britain was much richer, and the actual level of welfare</a>
00:08:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h08m14s">of the entire hierarchy rose significantly, making the people at the bottom richer</a>
00:08:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h08m20s">than the people at the center of the previous study.</a>
00:08:20</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h17m51s">to talk about reality is the presence of something that represents the hierarchy.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h18m18s">I think that's probably because ... men are more like group animals.</a>

00:19:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h19m42s">We see that in several ancient myths.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h19m52s">There is this dance of the individual with the hierarchy.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h19m54s">Hierarchy structures and disciplines the individual, producing a cultural being,</a>
00:19:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h20m00s">but then the cultural being hopefully appears “above” the hierarchy</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h20m06s">to change it. Hopefully relatively minimal, if necessary.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h20m12s">It is closely related to Piaget's idea that as children reach higher levels of moral development ...</a>
00:20:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h20m19s">First they play alone, then they can play with others, then they learn the rules,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h20m23s">and then morality is following the rules. And after that, and not every child gets to that point</a>
00:20:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h20m28s">(according to Piaget at least), the child begins to see itself</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h20m33s">as something that can make rules.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h20m37s">You can see that as the culmination, and that's how Piaget saw it, of ethical development.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h20m42s">Whether or not that's the highlight is debatable, as I think Jung ...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h20m48s">Jung elaborated on that idea, although people never take it as a variation of Piagetian thinking.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h20m53s">For Piaget, when you achieve individual status, when you don't coincide with the group and are an individual ...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h21m02s">it's not that you're rebellious, because you can follow the rules and usually you do,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h22m19s">Okay, Jung assumed that when you were socialized, you developed a “persona”.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h44m49s">is that you have to discover which archetypal forces direct you.</a>
00:44:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h44m55s">Because they are there whether you know it or not.</a>
00:44:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h44m57s">We have discussed that in some detail.</a>
00:44:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h44m59s">You can see it… from a biological perspective it is more mechanical.</a>
00:44:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h45m05s">You are an instrument of hunger and anger and fear and love and lust,</a>
00:45:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h45m12s">and those ancient forces that make up your domain of experience.</a>
00:45:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h45m20s">That is a purely biological way of thinking about it.</a>
00:45:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h45m23s">A more archetypal way to think about it is that those things are actually characters,</a>
00:45:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h45m27s">or personalities.</a>
00:45:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h45m28s">And they are organized in hierarchies, which are also characters and personalities.</a>
00:45:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h45m34s">And anger and fear and resentment and hatred and the bloodthirsty soul of man,</a>
00:45:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h45m42s">and all those things merge into a kind of "meta-personality."</a>
00:45:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h45m46s">And all the things that are the contrary of that merge into another.</a>
00:45:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h45m53s">And then the last battle for integration is the battle between those two things.</a>
00:45:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h45m58s">That is a very common mythological theme.</a>
00:45:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h46m01s">That is the battle between good and evil in heaven.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h46m04s">And that's incredibly old… it's been around since people had ideas.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h46m18s">to that ultimate contradiction, it is still a battle between titanic forces</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h46m45s">because he tried ... and many of the thinkers we've covered during this series,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h47m05s">You can call it mental health, but that is a description that falls seriously short,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h47m11s">because it is not just the absence of pathology, but something much more complex.</a>

00:47:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h47m47s">Nietzsche's idea was that the modern world had run into trouble,</a>
00:47:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h48m00s">because its tendency to seek truth had undermined belief in traditional axioms.</a>
00:48:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h48m09s">Good.</a>
00:48:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h48m10s">That seems to be correct.</a>
00:48:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h48m13s">And his solution to that was for people to become “übermenschen”, often translated</a>
00:48:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h48m20s">as “superhumans,” people who create their own values ​​to fill the void left by</a>
00:48:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h48m26s">the absence of traditional values.</a>
00:48:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h48m28s">But that idea is problematic.</a>
00:48:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h48m31s">First, individuals probably aren't able to do it because they don't live long enough.</a>
00:48:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h48m35s">And second, it is very difficult.</a>
00:48:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h48m36s">I mean, from this perspective: you are going to be the best philosopher</a>
00:48:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h48m41s">all time? because that's what it actually requires.</a>
00:48:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h48m43s">And the third problem: why do you think you create values?</a>
00:48:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h48m49s">Phenomenologically it is not clear that this is the case.</a>
00:48:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h48m52s">You experience them, and sometimes you don't even know where they come from.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h48m57s">You get angry.</a>

00:48:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h48m59s">Maybe you should think about it for three days.</a>
00:48:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h49m02s">So it is not clear how you created it yourself.</a>
00:49:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h49m09s">Jung's idea was that the forces we saw as traditional sources of values</a>
00:49:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h49m15s">were actually spontaneous constructions of the human psyche.</a>
00:49:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h49m20s">They weren't arbitrary control systems.</a>
00:49:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h49m23s">It went much deeper than that.</a>
00:49:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h49m25s">And I think if you are even a little biologist you read that and you think:</a>
00:49:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h49m32s">"Of course."</a>
00:49:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h49m35s">Even the social rules of a social hierarchy are anchored in you.</a>
00:49:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h49m40s">You know them.</a>
00:49:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h49m41s">You are in your body.</a>
00:49:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h49m42s">And so there is a biological basis for our understanding of culture.</a>
00:49:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h49m47s">It's almost in your marrow.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h49m50s">Jung's second thesis, and this one is very interesting, is that you are paying attention</a>
00:49:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h49m57s">your fantasies and your dreams, and your daydreams, can come into contact</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h50m03s">with some of the ancient psychic powers that used to be religious revelation</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h50m13s">And that's basically what Jungian psychotherapy is all about.</a>
00:50:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h50m16s">Why I focus on Jung is because people like Rogers</a>
00:50:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h50m24s">and the phenomenologists think in a similar way,</a>
00:50:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h50m30s">but they didn't get as far as Jung.</a>
00:50:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h50m32s">They did not come to the most far-reaching conclusions.</a>
00:50:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h50m35s">Maslow, for example, spoke of a hierarchy of needs,</a>
00:50:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h50m41s">and the person who developed himself was someone who had met all those basic needs and then moved up.</a>
00:50:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h50m48s">It's more or less true, but somewhat simplistic.</a>
00:50:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h50m52s">Because it is not clear that you have to satisfy all your basic needs first,</a>
00:50:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h50m56s">before you can act morally.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h51m27s">no, it is not a consequence of the satisfaction of needs, that is too materialistic,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BpUHDO4a_o#t=00h51m41s">Jung developed the idea of ​​personal development, in my opinion, to its most far-reaching consequences,</a>
