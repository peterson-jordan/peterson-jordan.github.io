00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h00m07s">Okay well, I wanna take issue with the formulation of that question, although I think it's a perfectly reasonable question. That's Jan Swan.</a>
00:00:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h00m14s">Don't be thinking, that a blue-collar lifestyle is necessarily subservient.</a>
00:00:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h00m18s">I mean - first of all, you can be a tradesperson. And that's a really good career choice, as far as I'm concerned.</a>
00:00:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h00m23s">It's very, very valuable.
I mean, you know...</a>
00:00:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h00m26s">Good plumbers are rare,
and good carpenters are rare,
and good bricklayers are rare.</a>
00:00:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h00m31s">And, they're so useful.
I mean, I do a lot of renovation work.</a>
00:00:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h00m34s">I've done an awful lot of renovation work,
on all the places that I- I've lived in.</a>
00:00:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h00m37s">And I've learned to do a fair bit of
construction and automotive bodywork,</a>
00:00:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h00m40s">and all those sorts of things,
and I really like doing it.</a>
00:00:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h00m43s">And you know, there's-
Blue-collar life is not necessarily subservient at all.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h00m48s">Because you can be master of your trade's domain, and be unbelievably economically useful, and productive, and creative, and independent, and autonomous and...</a>
00:00:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h00m56s">So, there's- There's nothing necessarily subservient about that.</a>
00:00:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h01m00s">Um... Now, you know, if you're thinking more about,
about let's say, life at the low end of a restaurant.</a>
00:01:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h01m06s">But even there, if you're a conscientious person,
and you're careful, and you're awake,</a>
00:01:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h01m11s">and you treat the people around you well, and you do your job properly - there's also room for advancement in the private sphere.</a>
00:01:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h01m17s">There's no reason to assume whatsoever, that merely because you don't have the intellectual horsepower</a>
00:01:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h01m24s">to work well [stutter] in the domain of rapidly shifting abstractions,</a>
00:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h01m29s">that your life has to be of secondary quality or opportunity. I don't see that at all.</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h01m35s">And there's endless opportunity in the trades.</a>
00:01:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h01m38s">And, I can- In Toronto for example,
there's a chronic shortage of tradespeople,</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h01m43s">and there's always a shortage of...
qualified people for every occupation.</a>
00:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h01m48s">So, um...</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h01m50s">If I have to tell someone, that they're best suited to a blue-collar lifestyle, I wouldn't feel bad about it!</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h01m55s">I might say to them: "Well look, y'know, um, you..."</a>
00:01:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h01m58s">You know, let's assume you talk to someone who has an IQ of a 100.</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h02m00s">Which is the IQ of the average high school graduate.</a>
00:02:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h02m03s">You might say: Well look, you know,
unless you're super conscientious,</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h02m08s">uh, a career in something like law
is probably not your best bet.</a>
00:02:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h02m11s">Because you're gonna be competing with people, who have IQs that are like, 30 points higher than yours, or 25 points higher than yours.</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h02m17s">And, if you really work yourself to death, you might be able to main- maintain competitiveness in that domain.</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h02m22s">But you're gonna be working at a powerful disadvantage,
because the people that you're competing with,</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h02m26s">for example, are going to be way faster than you verbally.</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h02m29s">They're gonna be able to read faster,
and to reason verbally faster, and all of that.</a>
00:02:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h02m33s">And, it might be better to pick up an ambition,</a>
00:02:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h02m38s">that's more in keeping with... the quality of your temperament, and your intelligence,</a>
00:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h02m42s">to put it bluntly. So that you can be...</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h02m44s">But that doesn't mean, that your success has to be limited!</a>
00:02:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h02m47s">And it also doesn't mean, that I'm elevating intelligence to a platform of the ultimate moral ideal.</a>
00:02:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h02m54s">Because, the relationship between intelligence and moral ideal is 0. There's no relationship between them, at all.</a>
00:02:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h03m01s">Intelligence is a capacity, let's say, that can be
put to ill use, just as well as to good use.</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h03m07s">And there's nothing intrinsically better about smart people.</a>
00:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h03m11s">They might be more useful for certain things,
if they're oriented towards the Good.</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h03m15s">But, um... there's absolutely-</a>
00:03:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h03m17s">There's no shortage of opportunity,
in the working class end of the World.</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h03m23s">And I can certainly understand, often why
people might prefer that, too to the endless...</a>

Chaotic miasma of complex, abstract jobs.</a>
00:03:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h03m36s">One of the problems with those sorts of jobs,
is that you've never done.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl7_pwO7R0w#t=00h03m39s">You're never finished.
There's always more work, than you can possibly do.</a>
