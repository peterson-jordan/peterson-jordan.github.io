<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h06m02s">And you think, well, that's exactly what happens to you when you grow up, right?</a>
00:06:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h06m06s">If you're reasonably well-socialized and properly looked-after, then your curiosity gets the better of you</a>
00:06:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h06m11s">and you keep going out into the world until...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h06m13s">what your parents have established for you is no longer sufficient for you.</a>
00:06:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h06m18s">And as a consequence of that movement out into the world, you find out all sorts of things--</a>
00:06:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h06m22s">characteristic of your own life--that not only your parents can't precisely explain to you</a>
00:06:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h06m28s">but even the broader formal structures of your culture have a very difficult time handling</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h06m34s">and when you finally do encounter such realities and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h06m38s">ALLOW their effect on you to fully manifest itself, well then, you're finally independent.</a>
00:06:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h06m43s">And you no longer can return home, but from that point forward</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h06m47s">you're also burdened--as Adam is burdened when he loses his paradisal unselfconsciousness--with the</a>
00:06:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h06m54s">full revelation of what it means to be limited and alive.</a>
00:06:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h06m58s">So, what happens to Buddha as a consequence of this revelation?</a>

00:07:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h07m05s">chronicles of the Buddhist adventure are careful to say that he becomes the world's most proficient</a>
00:07:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h07m12s">practitioner of samkhya, which was a philosophical precursor to yoga, and then to yoga.</a>
00:07:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h07m18s">So he masters all the positions in the asanas until he's disciplined physically to an almost unlimited degree</a>
00:07:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h07m24s">and then he decides that he'll adopt a stance of world renunciation,</a>
00:07:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h07m28s">which is also something he's remarkably good at,</a>
00:07:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h07m31s">and he starves himself until the chroniclers say he resembles nothing so much as a pile of dust.</a>
00:07:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h07m36s">And then having exhausted all the disciplinary structures that his sophisticated culture has to offer him</a>
00:07:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h07m43s">but still not precisely finding the answer that he's looking for</a>
00:07:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h07m47s">he retreats into the forest, a place of the unknown, and sits himself at the base of a tree.</a>
00:07:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h07m53s">Underneath the tree,</a>
00:07:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h07m55s">he's visited by visions and temptations. The first vision is an essentially erotic one:</a>
00:07:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h08m00s">life itself tempts him back out of his self-conscious state into the domain of pure physical pleasure.</a>
00:08:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h08m07s">A perfectly reasonable temptation, right? And one that's powerful enough so that Hindu philosophers say--</a>
00:08:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h08m13s">as their churches and cathedrals are covered with erotic drawings--</a>
00:08:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h08m17s">"If you can't get past the erotic drawings into the church, that's the domain that you should still inhabit," right?</a>
00:08:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h08m23s">In the dawning phases of life, at least till middle age,</a>
00:08:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h08m26s">that's the appropriate mode of being: to be enticed and seduced by the physical pleasures that life has to offer.</a>
00:08:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h08m33s">But in the final analysis, those are not sufficient to solve the problem of emergent self-consciousness.</a>
00:08:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h08m39s">And so the angel of death visits him and offers him the opportunity</a>
00:08:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h08m43s">to exist...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h08m45s">permanently in a state of Nirvana. A very, very interesting twist on the story because you have to wonder,</a>
00:08:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h08m51s">given the association, say, between</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h08m53s">suicidality and the notion of paradise that exists underneath that,</a>
00:08:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h08m58s">if what Buddha isn't being offered by the angel of death is in fact death</a>
00:08:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h09m02s">and the cessation of all the problems of being.</a>
00:09:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h09m05s">Regardless, he rejects that, attains enlightenment briefly,</a>
00:09:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h09m08s">and then decides to return to the world to share what he's discovered with all of suffering humanity.</a>
00:09:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h09m14s">The idea being that the Buddha, who is the awakened or enlightened one,</a>
00:09:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h09m19s">is capable of attaining a transcendent state, but also knows fully that...</a>
00:09:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h09m25s">because human beings have a shared social aspect,</a>
00:09:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h09m29s">it is not possible for any one person to attain redemption until all people attain redemption.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h09m34s">The reason being that it's very difficult to be transcendent and enlightened</a>
00:09:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycIAW0M2-NQ#t=00h09m39s">when you see someone, who's sick, lying in a ditch.</a>
