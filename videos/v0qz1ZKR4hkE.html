paradise as it’s presented in Genesis.</a>
00:00:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h00m39s">So the first aspect of the initial paradaisal
state is un-selfconsciousness.</a>
00:00:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h00m44s">Now if you look and factor analytic studies
of human personality you note that self-consciousness</a>
00:00:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h00m50s">although it is arguably our greatest gift
also loads almost entirely on the factor that</a>
00:00:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h00m56s">defines negative affect.</a>
00:00:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h00m58s">And you might also notice that when you say,
I became self-conscious you generally put</a>
00:00:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h01m03s">a negative cast on that in that I was talking
before a group of people and suddenly I was</a>
00:01:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h01m07s">seized by self-consciousness.</a>
00:01:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h01m09s">And as a consequence of that I was flooded
by negative emotion and was fundamentally</a>
00:01:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h01m14s">immobilized.</a>

state of being, our highest rational gift</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h01m22s">say, and the only on that clearly distinguishes
us from animals is also that which, when manifested,</a>
00:01:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h01m29s">makes us almost unbearable anxious</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h01m36s">characterized by an animal-like unselfconsciousness.</a>
00:01:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h01m40s">Adam and Eve, whatever they are, are not clearly
segregated from the rest of the world.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h01m45s">They have no idea, for example, of their own
nakedness.</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h01m49s">And if you think about what nakedness means,
you immediately understand that that’s also</a>
00:01:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h01m53s">a very profound, dramatic representation.</a>
00:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h01m57s">You know with children around the age of 3
or 4, many of them regardless of their mode</a>

about privacy, say with regard to bodily functions</a>
00:02:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h02m07s">and also very concerned about ever showing
themselves without clothing</a>
00:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h02m11s">and it’s perfectly reasonable to presume
that that’s a consequence of their emergent</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h02m18s">self-consciousness, an event that takes place
somewhere between the ages of 2 and 5 and</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h02m22s">that’s a defining moment that makes them
segregatable, say from their mother.</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h02m27s">And so you also have images of Paradise that
flow through Western history that are characterized</a>
00:02:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h02m34s">by the image of the unconscious union between
the mother and child</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h02m39s">which is an imagistic representation that
eradicates the tension of self-consciousness</a>
00:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h02m46s">both for the mother and for the child.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h02m49s">So the notion that the child is living in
a paradaisal condition that is somehow lost</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h03m02s">It’s also a place where order and chaos
are in perfect balance</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h03m07s">and you know that because what paradise means
is para – around, daisa – a wall, while</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h03m14s">Eden means delight or a place of delight.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h03m23s">and a garden is precisely that place where
the forces of nature or chaos and the forces</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h03m32s">That’s what a garden is.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h03m34s">It’s nature given form by culture and it’s

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h04m10s">the place of craziest stability can be regarded

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h04m14s">So if you remember the story of Moses leading
his people through the desert, it’s clearly</a>
00:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h04m19s">the case that when the Israelites were in

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h04m31s">So it’s perfectly reasonable and expectable
for people who are caught in a crisis to look</a>

00:04:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h04m47s">So the story that’s laid out in Genesis
has its structure something like this.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qz1ZKR4hkE#t=00h05m27s">banal forms of conservatism which are always
