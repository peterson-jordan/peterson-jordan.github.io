<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h00m20s">much of their thinking was motivated by what happened during World War II.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h00m25s">The last time I gave you lecture, I described the summary of Nietzsche and Dostoevsky</a>
00:00:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h00m32s">about the situation of the world and the psychological situation of the world at the end</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h00m36s">of the nineteenth century. And that was that our new ways of thinking had undermined our faith,</a>
00:00:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h00m42s">and our old ways of thinking. And that was a problem because people need something</a>
00:00:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h00m46s">on which they can build, and to orient themselves and move forward. Nietzsche and Dostoevsky</a>

00:00:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h00m59s">Dostoevsky wrote about this quite extensively in a book entitled "Notes from the Underground."</a>
00:00:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h01m03s">If any of you are interested in it, especially in clinical psychology,</a>
00:01:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h01m07s">you should really read this book because it is one of the most brilliant psychological studies</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h01m17s">It is very precise, and there are parts of “Guilt and Penance” that are also true.</a>
00:01:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h01m21s">I think the way they depict psychological phenomena is unsurpassed.</a>
00:01:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h01m28s">I don't know how he did it ... I mean Dostoevsky was epileptic, I don't know if</a>
00:01:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h01m33s">you know, but he was arrested by the Tsar's men in the late nineteenth century for being a revolutionist student.</a>
00:01:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h01m40s">They threw him in jail in Moscow, and one day they put him</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h01m48s">in front of a firing squad and shot him six in the morning, but they used blanks,</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h01m52s">which of course he didn't know.</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h01m54s">He was so shocked by this that he developed epilepsy (which is possible, by the way).</a>
00:01:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h02m00s">Then he had epilepsy for the rest of his life, but he had a peculiar kind of epilepsy,</a>
00:02:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h02m04s">which is actually not very rare. Some people who have epilepsy</a>
00:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h02m09s">experience a phenomenon they call an “aura” which is an altered form of consciousness,</a>
00:02:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h02m13s">before the seizure starts, and those auras can be very strange.</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h02m16s">I once read about a man, his aura was that his hand was possessed by demons</a>
00:02:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h02m23s">from hell and he could feel the possession creeping up his arm, to his shoulder,</a>
00:02:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h02m28s">and when it got to his head, he had an epileptic fit.</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h02m30s">There is another case, this man had an aura where a double appeared behind him,</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h02m38s">But when he turned to look, he had a seizure,</a>
00:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h02m43s">but if he didn't turn to look, then he didn't.</a>
00:02:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h02m46s">Such brain disorders are strange things, because the system is disrupted</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h02m51s">lives, and is capable of many extremely remarkable deviant behavior.</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h02m57s">Either way, Dostoevsky's aura was an aura that revealed the world. What Dostoevsky experienced</a>
00:02:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h03m04s">was that the meaning of things got deeper and deeper and deeper,</a>
00:03:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h03m09s">and the moment he would discover the secret of all things,</a>
00:03:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h03m12s">he had an epileptic fit.</a>
00:03:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h03m14s">But he said the quality of his experience during the aura was so high, so overwhelming,</a>
00:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h03m20s">and so deep that he would have exchanged all his normal experiences</a>
00:03:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h03m24s">for those experiences. And he had them repeatedly.</a>
00:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h03m27s">I really think this broadening of his vision and concepts is due to epilepsy</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h03m34s">transformed him, among other things.</a>
00:03:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h03m36s">He had been through some damn tough things as he spent a long time in prison with rapists</a>
00:03:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h03m41s">and murderers in Siberia, although he was some kind of aristocrat.</a>
00:03:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h03m46s">He had a rough time, and I imagine that expanded his thinking too,</a>
00:03:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h03m52s">since he survived. But I really think his epileptic insight was essential</a>
00:03:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h03m58s">for his unsurpassed genius, so his aura ... Other people also experience epileptic auras,</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h04m06s">such symptoms, and some people are so fascinated with the aura</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h04m10s">that they are not taking drugs for epilepsy because they do not want to miss the experience</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h04m15s">that precedes the aura, or the epileptic seizure.</a>
00:04:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h04m20s">And Dostoevsky's experiences, the awesome element of the aura, is also relevant to</a>
00:04:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h04m27s">what we're going to talk about today. Because both Binswanger and Boss were very interested in</a>
00:04:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h04m32s">how meaning manifests itself in the world.</a>
00:04:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h04m35s">And they had opposite explanations.</a>
00:04:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h04m38s">I actually think they are parallel statements, but the meaning that Dostoevsky experienced</a>
00:04:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h04m45s">is an enlargement of the normal way in which meaning is revealed in the world.</a>
00:04:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h04m53s">And people experience things like that in different forms of altered consciousness.</a>
00:04:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h04m59s">Anyway, Binswanger and Boss mainly worked in the 1950s, and like I said, they were</a>
00:04:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h05m05s">very concerned about what happened in World War II.</a>
00:05:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h05m08s">In fact, Dostoevsky and Nietzsche predicted that it would become nihilism, or</a>
00:05:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h05m13s">ideological totalitarianism, which is exactly what happened. By the time 1930 appeared,</a>
00:05:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h05m20s">the Germans had gone through a terrible First World War.</a>
00:05:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h05m28s">And then they got insane hyperinflation.</a>
00:05:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h05m32s">In the 1920s, Germany underwent that, in part because they had to pay such large debts for it</a>
00:05:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h05m37s">the first World War.</a>
00:05:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h05m39s">German inflation reached the point where it literally exceeded one hundred million marks</a>
00:05:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h05m46s">had to pay for a loaf of bread.</a>
00:05:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h05m48s">They took wheelbarrows with money to the grocer.</a>
00:05:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h05m53s">What happened was the value of their money fell to zero, and it does</a>
00:05:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h05m58s">more often than you think with economies.</a>
00:05:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h06m00s">The value is zero, and that was it, then a reboot has to be done, as it were.</a>
00:06:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h06m05s">The war was terrible, and hundreds of thousands of men had been killed</a>
00:06:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h06m09s">or damaged.</a>
00:06:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h06m10s">Then their economy collapsed.</a>
00:06:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h06m13s">And at the same time, or a little earlier, the Russian revolution took place,</a>
00:06:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h06m19s">at the end of the First World War, and communism was</a>
00:06:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h06m24s">came to power, and the communists stirred all over Europe, and in North America.</a>
00:06:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h06m28s">And their goal was to bring about a worldwide communist revolution.</a>
00:06:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h06m34s">So the Germans went crazy because the communists would take over the country, which is a great deal</a>
00:06:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h06m39s">was reasonable anxiety. And instead, fascism arose, and fascism was</a>
00:06:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h06m46s">a form of totalitarianism, and I think the Germans were desperate for order at the time.</a>
00:06:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h06m52s">And that's what the fascists offered, at least in theory.</a>
00:06:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h06m57s">Unfortunately it turned out that they offered them a little too much order,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h07m20s">And those practices were difficult to understand in several ways.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h08m13s">This was often the case, especially at the end of the war, and the Nazis always opted for persistence</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h12m02s">I'll give you an explanation.</a>
00:12:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h12m05s">Let's assume a few things.</a>
00:12:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h12m08s">The first assumption is that there were many hateful Germans.</a>
00:12:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h12m13s">Why?</a>
00:12:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h12m14s">They had lost World War I, that was not good. There were many</a>
00:12:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h12m18s">hardened men about, for they had been in the trenches, and shot</a>
00:12:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h12m21s">and fought under truly ghastly conditions for years.</a>
00:12:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h12m26s">So there were a lot of damaged men.</a>
00:12:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h12m29s">And then their whole economy collapsed, because they were forced to one,</a>
00:12:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h12m35s">what historians see as a very punitive, peace treaty to sign. Everything fell apart</a>
00:12:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h12m41s">in a way that we cannot imagine.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h12m43s">In the 1930s, the Germans started to get up, and then Hitler</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h12m50s">came to power, he began not only to re-arm but also to re-industrialize the economy.</a>
00:12:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h12m54s">And he did that well.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h12m56s">Hitler was a good orator, although he was not a coherent one</a>

00:13:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h13m10s">He certainly wasn't stupid.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h13m11s">I wouldn't say he was very well educated, but he had developed a lot</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h13m16s">sense of aesthetics. And he spent a lot of time designing the cities he would build</a>
00:13:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h13m21s">when the war was over.</a>
00:13:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h13m26s">And he designed those cities as places where art, or at least the Nazi version of art, would flourish.</a>
00:13:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h13m30s">There is no evidence that what was wrong with the Nazis was a lack of civilization.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h13m36s">In fact, there is more evidence that they were, I think, too civilized.</a>
00:13:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h13m40s">I will discuss that later.</a>
00:13:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h13m42s">Anyway, you think, "How did Hitler manage to bewitch all those people?"</a>
00:13:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h13m47s">This is a hypothesis based on Jungian thinking.</a>
00:13:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h13m51s">I'm letting you know because Jung has been accused of being an anti-Semite.</a>
00:13:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h13m56s">There are several reasons for this, partly because of what happened during World War II,</a>
00:13:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h14m00s">and partly because his theory borrowed much from Christianity, though</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h14m06s">to other sources. And he believed there were differences in the psychology of people with diabetes</a>
00:14:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h14m10s">different ethnic backgrounds.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h14m12s">Whether that's racist depends on whether or not you like the person you're talking to.</a>
00:14:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h14m17s">Because political leftists think that there are cultural differences, and that they are important,</a>
00:14:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h14m21s">but if you bring that up in the wrong way, you are a racist.</a>
00:14:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h14m24s">And politically right people just think there are ethnic differences.</a>
00:14:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h14m27s">It's a tricky issue.</a>
00:14:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=00h14m30s">If there are no differences that are important, then what about multiculturalism?</a>
00:14:30</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h12m39s">His wife came to visit him.</a>
01:12:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h12m40s">He couldn't remember anything that had happened.</a>
01:12:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h12m42s">He was shocked to see her because he didn't see his memories.</a>
01:12:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h12m47s">He said, "It's like seeing you for the first time."</a>
01:12:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h12m50s">And it was, he saw her for the first time.</a>
01:12:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h12m54s">Access to the restrictive structures that used to direct his attention was gone.</a>
01:12:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h12m58s">It was an interesting case because now and then he played the piano.</a>
01:12:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h13m03s">He had an epileptic fit and then he could play like he used to play.</a>
01:13:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h13m09s">It was as if he had to switch brain modes and the switching mechanism was damaged.</a>
01:13:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h13m13s">He had to get a little attack and then he could play Beethoven sonatas like crazy.</a>
01:13:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h13m19s">Then he had a minor seizure and came back:</a>
01:13:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h13m23s">"As if I see everything for the first time."</a>
01:13:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h13m26s">I think psychedelics were so attractive to people in the 1960s,</a>
01:13:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h13m31s">and for people since the beginning of time, because in a sense they take care of it.</a>
01:13:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h13m37s">Suddenly the representations of your memory are gone.</a>
01:13:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h13m40s">What do you see then?</a>
01:13:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h13m41s">God knows, but it's not what you expect.</a>
01:13:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h13m45s">And maybe that's what's there, but maybe that's not.</a>
01:13:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h13m55s">I'm going to summarize this.</a>
01:13:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h14m10s">What do you think drives people to extreme forms of pathology?</a>
01:14:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h14m13s">That could be your pathology: your misery, your suffering, and all that.</a>
01:14:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h14m17s">Or it could be your social psychopathology, your murderous desire to destroy.</a>
01:14:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h14m25s">Now a phenomenological theory.</a>
01:14:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h14m32s">The “terror management” theory is that you have to build these structures in your head</a>
01:14:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h14m36s">to protect yourself from agony. So what the terror management theorists are basically saying is that</a>
01:14:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h14m40s">the more blind you are, the better off you are.</a>
01:14:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h14m43s">That is also what the “positive illusion” thinkers think.</a>
01:14:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h14m46s">The phenomenologists approached this in a different way.</a>
01:14:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h14m48s">They said that the meaning that constantly manifests itself is nourishing and revitalizing,</a>
01:14:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h14m55s">although it is also so powerful it can blow you over.</a>
01:14:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h14m59s">It's dangerous to mess around with it.</a>
01:14:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h15m01s">It's like the burning bush.</a>
01:15:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h15m04s">You have to build a structure to deal with it because you have to</a>
01:15:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h15m07s">limit it to something you can handle.</a>
01:15:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h15m10s">But you have to build this structure correctly and precisely so that the meaning manifests itself</a>
01:15:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h15m16s">can be shaped by you into a world, conceptually and practically. Which ensures that</a>
01:15:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h15m22s">the remaining meaning can appear in a way that is revitalizing enough,</a>
01:15:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h15m29s">so that you don't get corrupted in such a way that you become genocidal.</a>
01:15:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h15m33s">That's a good theory, and that's what the phenomenologists were all about.</a>
01:15:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h15m39s">That's why the existentialists and phenomenologists say:</a>
01:15:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h15m46s">“Don't lie to yourself about what is manifesting to you.</a>
01:15:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h15m50s">Don't use language instrumentally. ”</a>
01:15:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h15m53s">Why?</a>
01:15:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h15m55s">Because if you do that and twist the structures you use to interpret the world,</a>
01:15:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h16m01s">the world will become twisted for you and what will reveal itself is horror.</a>
01:16:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h16m07s">And if nothing but horror appears to you all the time, you will not be okay.</a>
01:16:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h16m15s">Because you can't handle such pressure.</a>
01:16:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h16m18s">You will become bitter and resentful.</a>
01:16:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h16m23s">Everything around you will fall apart because you are not modeling reality</a>
01:16:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h16m28s">in a way that positive meaning can appear.</a>
01:16:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h16m30s">You will fail and become resentful.</a>
01:16:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h16m33s">And you will become bitter.</a>
01:16:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h16m35s">Then you will look for someone to hurt, and you will have plenty of justifications there</a>
01:16:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h16m39s">have for.</a>
01:16:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h16m42s">And worse, and this is a Jungian contribution to this idea: this will not happen all at once,</a>
01:16:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h16m48s">it will happen as a consequence of a hundred thousand micro-decisions that you</a>
01:16:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h16m53s">hardly notices. Where you can be sincere about something or not, in a miniscule way that seems almost irrelevant.</a>
01:16:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h17m00s">But the consequence of doing that for a longer period of time, for example three hundred thousand decisions,</a>
01:17:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h17m06s">is that you make yourself a kind of monster that you couldn't face in the mirror.</a>
01:17:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h17m11s">And one of the things the phenomenologists would tell you too,</a>
01:17:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h17m14s">and Jung also said this is, "You probably are that kind of monster too."</a>
01:17:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h17m20s">If you want to deal with that, you have to start taking things seriously.</a>
01:17:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h17m25s">There are two things you should take seriously.</a>
01:17:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h17m29s">One is the meaning that appears to you, and the other is whether you are sincere</a>
01:17:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h17m38s">when you interact with that meaning.</a>
01:17:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h17m41s">The ultimate consequence of that is your health, the health of your family</a>
01:17:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h17m47s">and your society, the health of the whole society rests on it.</a>
01:17:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h17m56s">The way the world develops is the end result of the choices we all make,</a>
01:17:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h18m00s">all those little micro-decisions.</a>
01:18:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h18m01s">They are like ripples of water in a lake. So if you do something small that isn't right</a>
01:18:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h18m08s">that you know you shouldn't do, you are actually distorting the fabric of reality.</a>
01:18:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h18m13s">And that's very interesting because we now know what happens when you do that.</a>
01:18:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h18m18s">What happens is we end up with the Nazis and the Communists and the hydrogen bombs.</a>
01:18:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h18m23s">And we have not yet escaped that.</a>
01:18:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7a1RXMbHI#t=01h18m26s">Hopefully it will, but it won't happen if people don't learn anything from the twentieth century.</a>
