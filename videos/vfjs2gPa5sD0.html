<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h00m42s">But you can get an estimate of your intelligence then</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h00m48s">and the reason for that is, well obviously,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h01m01s">but your crystallized IQ remains more or less intact</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h01m04s">So even though they're not different,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h01m15s">so, then at least that's how it looks to me</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h01m18s">Okay so how smart do you have to be to be different things in life? Well...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h01m51s">That's not the high-end for IQ, by the way</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h01m54s">You know, it can go up</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h01m55s">Well it can go up indefinitely,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h01m57s">Although there's fewer and fewer people as it goes up.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h02m04s">Then having an IQ of above 145 is a necessity</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h02m07s">And maybe you're pushing 160 in some situations</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h02m10s">and maybe that's making you one person in 10,000 or even in 100,000</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h02m15s">And then also,</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h02m16s">To really be good at it you probably have to be reasonably stress tolerant and also somewhat conscientious</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h02m22s">So people, and you think well</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h02m24s">Why is it that smart people are at the top of dominance hierarchies?</a>
00:02:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h02m28s">And the answer to that, in part, is because they get there first.</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h02m30s">Right? And everything's a race, roughly speaking</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h02m34s">And the faster you are, the more likely you are to be at the forefront of the pack</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h02m41s">So if you're moving towards something difficult rapidly,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h08m51s">(Peterson) Yes. Drugs!</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h08m53s">Yea, drugs of abuse.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h08m55s">(student) <em>inaudible</em> ...15% of the population falling out of society</a>
00:08:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h08m59s">well that's what is happening to a large degree is people drop out of the employment race</a>
00:08:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h09m03s">they get very depressed,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h09m07s">because chronic pain and depression are very much the same thing,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h09m10s">and then they subsist on opiates, which are subsidised by Medicaid in the US.</a>
00:09:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h09m14s">I'm not kidding about this, this is exactly what's happening!</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h09m23s">(student) how large will that stratum of people grow?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h09m51s">Yea, they're going to sit at home and, you know, be miserable with their wives and take opiates</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h09m56s">because they have chronic pain problems</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h09m58s">and you might think well - could they think up something else to do?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h10m07s">you know, that isn't how it works</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjs2gPa5sD0#t=00h10m09s">because you're more of a - you're an    'act' person, not a 'thinking' person.</a>
