00:01:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h02m00s">So, after considering it for a while,</a>
00:02:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h02m02s">I agreed to come speak at Linfield College.</a>
00:02:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h02m04s">On March 18th, I received a note from an inviting student, who said:</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h02m13s">"Good morning Dr. Peterson, I would be overjoyed to confirm a date."</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h02m17s">So we went about doing that.</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h02m18s">On April 7th, he replied to me again to update me. He said:</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h02m31s">I'm referring to the event simply as 'A Talk with Jordan Peterson' because his speaking style allows for a lot of fluidity in topic.</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h02m40s">However, the core theme to the event is the importance of Freedom of speech, especially in higher education</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h02m46s">Some of the administration/student government have begun to fret about the potential for people to feel 'offended and oppressed' by Peterson's talk.</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h02m57s">It's more pushback than I'd expected at Linfield, but I don't think it's a cause for concern.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h03m03s">I find it hard to keep their worries at bay.</a>
00:03:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h03m05s">And there's a very supportive group of students and community members who have my back.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h03m42s">Linfield College posted a picture of the ball on its instagram account, but it was later removed because of the frog's association with alt-right groups</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h03m49s">"As soon as it was pointed out that the photo included the image, the Instagram post was removed."</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h05m11s">Wells said his goals with the free speech ball were to get people thinking about the rights to free expression, and to bring more attention to the YAL group.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h05m20s">He said: "I understand that it's necessary to set the limits, but I don't think this cartoon frog is a limit to set for free speech.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h06m01s">Problematic because neither Peterson nor the film will be promoting dialogues about gendered inclusions,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h06m06s">but rather be promoting a dangerous and offensive logic of gendered exclusions.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h09m48s">And of course they've known about this for a long time.</a>
00:09:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h09m51s">"Dear Susan,</a>
00:09:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h09m53s">I received a copy of your letter to the Linfield community this morning,</a>
00:09:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h09m57s">as well as an indication that my long scheduled talk at Linfield has been canceled,</a>
00:09:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h10m02s">that is fine, I suppose,</a>
00:10:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h10m03s">except that the plane tickets have been booked and the hotel reservations have been made, as well as three days taken out of my schedule at my expense.</a>
00:10:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h10m12s">I think you are treating me and the student group who invited me in a manner that is absolutely reprehensible,</a>
00:10:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h10m19s">as well as cowardly and underhanded.</a>
00:10:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h10m22s">I have made arrangements to come to Linfield, which is extremely distant from me, and out of the way, in good faith.</a>
00:10:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h10m29s">Now you cancel it,</a>
00:10:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h10m30s">with a plethora of specious reasons including your anti-harassment policy,</a>
00:10:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h10m36s">although I have harassed no one, nor intimidated, exploited or threatened force.</a>
00:10:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h10m40s">Had I not previously received notice of the controversy of my arrival, which is in my opinion unwarranted,</a>
00:10:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h10m47s">I would not have tweeted my intent to 'violate safe spaces'</a>
00:10:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h10m53s">which is a satirical comment in case it needs to be said.</a>
00:10:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h10m56s">Obviously, you were looking for any excuse, no matter how trivial, to cancel this event.</a>
00:10:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h11m02s">You also note that 'This event no longer presents the possibility of academic inquiry within the Linfield community'</a>
00:11:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h11m11s">I might point out that Linfield is a college, not a community, and that ideas need to be discussed in a college.</a>
00:11:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h11m19s">You also state that 'Anti-harassment policies are not intended to limit the free exchange of opinions, or the vigorous debate of ideas'</a>
00:11:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h11m29s">and then precede to do exactly that.</a>
00:11:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h11m32s">You also mentioned that you have received support from 'like-minded supporters' from outside your community,</a>
00:11:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h11m40s">which is hardly surprising or informative given that they were like minded.</a>
00:11:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h11m45s">You also suggest that because the contract was delayed one day, that constitutes sufficient grounds for cancellation,</a>
00:11:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h11m52s">even though you knew perfectly well that the event was booked and finalized, and that such delays are by no means unheard of in such situations.</a>
00:11:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h12m00s">You might also note that a guest invited to your college might expect to be treated with a modicum of consideration and respect.</a>
00:12:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h12m08s">Here's what I plan to do:</a>
00:12:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h12m10s">I am going to make a video tomorrow morning at the latest, reading this letter on Youtube, explaining that my invitation has been revoked, what that means for me,</a>
00:12:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h12m19s">and the nature of the reasons given</a>
00:12:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h12m21s">I will also read this letter of response from me.</a>
00:12:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h12m26s">It should be watched by about a 150000 viewers, many of whom I imagine will be Linfield alumni supporters and students,</a>
00:12:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h12m33s">I am perfectly willing to see what they all have to say.</a>
00:12:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h12m36s">Then we can let the dust settle where it may.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h12m45s">I received absolutely nothing in response.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h12m48s">Got no, uh, they didn't even have the decency to send me a notification explaining their rationale, nothing.</a>
00:12:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h12m56s">So I was treated as far as I'm concerned with, well let's call it unprofessionally and leave it at that.</a>
00:12:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h13m03s">So what's the story now?</a>

00:20:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h20m16s">The first thing I'd like to say, is that...</a>
00:20:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h20m23s">Parker told me ten(10) minutes before the talk that he has very much enjoyed going to Linfield College</a>
00:20:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h20m31s">which I just had an opportunity to stroll through : it's absolutely spectacular and beautiful.</a>
00:20:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h20m38s">It looks like everyone's dream of a classic liberal arts college.</a>
00:20:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h20m43s">So, he wanted me to let everyone know he's had a great time and that he didn't want to bring any disrepute on the college</a>
00:20:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h20m51s">So, I thought I'd do that because, it's important to know that.</a>
00:20:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h20m56s">It's easy for things to be made black-and-white, because that's simple.</a>
00:20:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h21m01s">Things aren't a least bit simple. It's useful to keep that in mind.</a>
00:21:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h21m06s">So, I'm going to start this by reading you something that I wrote specifically for this talk.</a>
00:21:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h21m15s">I wanted / I always want to do something different in each talk because</a>
00:21:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h21m21s">-well pretty done in the previous talk- and partly the reason that you talk</a>
00:21:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h21m28s">is to get things clear in your mind. It's a good way of thinking. It's the best way of thinking.</a>
00:21:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h21m35s">So, I suppose in some sense, it's a / don't know if it's a poem.</a>
00:21:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h21m40s">Maybe that's what it is.</a>
00:21:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h21m42s">It's what I hope to cover tonight, so what I'm gonna do is read you the outline first. I guess it's an outline.</a>
00:21:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h21m47s">and then i'm gonna go through it, line by line, and see if I can clarify to you and also to me what I mean</a>
00:21:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h21m57s">So, I'm going to orient the talk tonight around the ethics of free speech.</a>
00:21:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h22m02s">We / you've talked a lot about or caught a lot about , let's say, the right to free speech.</a>
00:22:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h22m09s">And something you might want also consider the obligation to free speech.</a>
00:22:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h22m14s">Because I actually think it's deeper than a right.</a>
00:22:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h22m18s">I think you're obligated to speak freely.</a>
00:22:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h22m21s">Because otherwise, people don't have the benefit or your / whatever wisdom you possess.</a>
00:22:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h22m26s">And, at least you possess the wisdom of your own experience.</a>
00:22:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h22m31s">At the very least, you have that.</a>
00:22:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h22m33s">And that's as valid a form of thruth as any other form of truth.</a>
00:22:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h22m37s">And, it's often a truth that can be usefully communicated to other people.</a>
00:22:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h22m41s">So, it's to the community's benefit you say what your experience has caught on, because</a>
00:22:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h22m48s">There isn't anyone who has exprience like you and one of the things that I've learned.</a>
00:22:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h22m52s">from being a clinical psychologist -but I would say more specifically from being a very careful listener-</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h22m58s">is that if you listen to people AND they can talk to you, they tell you the most amazing things.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h23m08s">Even today, you know, I was speaking to four different people. They're supporters of mine (online).</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h23m29s">And that's something that you can do by listening to someone.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h23m33s">They open up and they're / it's as interesting as a [Fyodor] Dostoyevsky novel</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h23m42s">And it's important that they can speak freely about that, because then, they can tell you all the things they know that you don't know.</a>
00:23:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h23m50s">and you get to know them, and that's such a good deal.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h26m23s">One seems to have to do with the structure of being itself.</a>

00:26:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h26m44s">What I thought when my son was young, when he was, maybe three(3) years old.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h27m18s">and partly by the fact that they look at the world as if it's a new thing</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h27m55s">Well, as a liability, I suppose that's one way of thinking about it.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h27m59s">But then I thought, well, that's an interesting way of looking at it, that it's only a liability</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h28m03s">Because, maybe you would like your child not to be vulnerable, but</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h28m10s">in a practical manner, I suppose, I thought well</a>

00:29:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h29m07s">because realizations like this, of course, unfold over time</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h29m12s">when you deeply care for someone</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h29m22s">You care for the remarkable fact of their weakness and specificity</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h29m35s">And so, to love someone is to simultaneously accept their vulnerability as a valid part of their being</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h29m42s">and that's a necessary thing to do in life, because life is suffering</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h29m49s">but without it, without the vulnerability that brings suffering, then, there doesn't seem to be any possiblity of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h30m23s">The question was:</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h30m25s">What does a being with the classical attributes of God    -Omniscience, Omnipotence and Omnipresence-</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h30m33s">It's a very interesting question, because, of course, the obvious is, well, "nothing!"</a>
00:30:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h30m39s">but that's the wrong answer. The right answer is that being like that lacks limitation</a>
00:30:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h30m44s">The commentator was putting that argument forward as a justification for the creation of Man</a>
00:30:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h30m51s">And I thought that was a spectacularly brilliant insight</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h31m13s">great inventors of the late 19th century had made things increasingly easy for people</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h31m18s">His task was going to be to determine how it was that he could make life more difficult for people</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h31m25s">He knew he would be thanked as one of the benefactors of the age for doing precisely that.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h31m30s">Kierkegaard attempted to, I suppose, lay a heavy moral burden on his readers</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h31m36s">And he knew that was perhaps not something that people would appreciate immediately</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h49m26s">it's paradoxical because we often don't think of peace as something that's reached through conflict</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h52m27s">And so that's why we think - </a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h52m33s">And then, the reason that we speak is to learn from other people's thoughts, but more than that,</a>
00:52:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h52m41s">it's that thinking individually is a very limited process</a>
00:52:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h52m47s">because you're ignorant, which means you don't know everything</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h53m15s">And so what we do because of that is talk.</a>
00:53:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h53m19s">And so, if I talk, and I'm speaking truthfully, which means I'm telling you how things appear to be to me,</a>
00:53:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h53m26s">that does not mean that I possess the truth, that means I'm saying as articulate in my manner as I possibly can how things appear to me,</a>
00:53:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h53m35s">then you can tell me how things appear to you,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h53m37s">and I can listen to you and maybe you can tell me some things about how things appear that I don't already know,</a>
00:53:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h53m43s">and that's such a good deal because the purpose of thinking is to let our thoughts die instead of us,</a>
00:53:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h53m50s">and if you can kill one of my thoughts because it's stupid, then I don't have to act it out and die and so that's like a really good deal</a>
00:53:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h53m58s">So, the reason that we engage in dialogue is that we can take the thoughts that protect us from our own mortality</a>
00:53:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h54m06s">and improve them, and perhaps improve them erratically and there's just no loss in that,</a>
00:54:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h54m12s">and so what that means in some sense is that you can view everyone who disagrees with you as a source of potential wisdom</a>
00:54:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h54m18s">because if you talk to someone who agrees with you, all you're going to find out is what you already know and you already know that</a>
00:54:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h54m25s">and if you talk to someone who doesn't agree with you,</a>
00:54:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h54m27s">maybe one of the ten things they say or maybe one of a hundred things or God only knows, you know,</a>
00:54:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h54m33s">maybe they're as wise as you in their perverse way and you can discuss something with them</a>
00:54:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h54m38s">and they'll tell you something you've never really thought of before, and that'll just make some potentially miserable event in your like that much less likely</a>
00:54:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h54m48s">and how good for you can that possibly be?</a>
00:54:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h54m50s">I do believe that I've learned that, I've talked to a great variety of people, and I don't care if people agree with me,</a>
00:54:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h54m57s">in fact, generally speaking, I find it more interesting if they don't,</a>
00:54:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h55m01s">and I don't try to convince people because I don't believe I have any right to determine their destiny</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h55m08s">and I don't want to determine their destiny because I don't know what's best for them,</a>
00:55:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h55m13s">and so I do listen to all sorts of strange and unlikely people and they tell me things that I don't know all the time</a>
00:55:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h55m21s">and that is just a spectacularly good deal.</a>
00:55:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h55m24s">And I decided a long time ago that one of the fundamental choices you make in life is whether you're in love with what you know or in love with what you don't know,</a>
00:55:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h55m35s">and I would say there's a lot more of what you don't know than there is of what you know</a>
00:55:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h55m40s">and so it would be better to be in love with what you don't know because you don't know so much</a>
00:55:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h55m46s">that if you can make friends with what you don't know, then you're going to be continually enlightened.</a>
00:55:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h55m53s">And to be enlightened is to be engaged in the process of being enlightened, not to be enlightened in any final sense</a>
00:55:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h56m00s">because that's just not possible.</a>
00:56:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h56m02s">So it's to act in a manner that continually enlightens you and a huge part of that is humility,</a>
00:56:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h56m08s">and that's another word that's very difficult to use, I would say,</a>
00:56:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h56m12s">like love, because it's another word that's been mouthed to death in some sense</a>
00:56:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h56m18s">and it sounds like kind of cringing cowardliness.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h56m24s">That it has that connotation, but that's not what it means</a>
00:56:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h56m26s">what it means is that you know that there isn't enough to you,</a>
00:56:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h56m31s">and you can tell that there isn't enough to you because your life isn't everything it could be.</a>
00:56:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h56m36s">That's the evidence, right?</a>
00:56:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h56m37s">If your life is everything you could imagine it to be, then perhaps you don't need humility</a>
00:56:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h56m43s">but since your life isn't everything you could imagine it to be, then you're deeply wrong about a lot of things,</a>
00:56:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h56m49s">and so since you're wrong, then you should be in around for the opportunity to correct those errors</a>
00:56:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h56m56s">because why wouldn't you?</a>
00:56:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h56m58s">Except to protect your territory and that territory by definition, given the existence of your own suffering, is insufficient</a>
00:56:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h57m05s">so why are you clinging to it so desperately?</a>
00:57:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h57m09s">It doesn't provide what you need or what you want</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h57m13s">and a transformation of it, and the expansion, and the re-figuring of it might be everything that you can possibly want</a>
00:57:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h57m26s">and so then you start to envision yourself instead of, as the holder of a piece of territory, as the person who is attempting to expand their capacity,</a>
00:57:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h57m33s">and to act within all sorts of territories, and exposure to more people and to more viewpoints, especially if those people are telling you the truth,</a>
00:57:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h57m42s">which they will do if you actually listen to them,</a>
00:57:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h57m46s">then you can have your cake and eat it too.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h57m49s">That's a great deal.</a>
00:57:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h57m50s">It's another way of reducing unnecessary suffering in the world by,</a>
00:57:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h57m55s">certainly, reducing your suffering and perhaps, learning to be - how to be a greater use to people around you, which again, seems to be nothing but for the good.</a>
00:57:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h58m10s">So humility is recognition of personal insufficiency and the willingness to learn,</a>
00:58:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h58m15s">in order to overcome that insufficiency,</a>
00:58:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h58m17s">and then to learn is to die voluntarily and be born again, in great ways and small.</a>
00:58:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h58m23s">That's an archetypal idea at the basis of Western civilization,</a>
00:58:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h58m28s">is the idea that the logos, which is the capacity for truthful speech,</a>
00:58:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h58m33s">is somehow associated with the act of death and rebirth</a>
00:58:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h58m39s">and there's multiple ways of interpreting that idea,</a>
00:58:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h58m42s">and because I'm a psychologist, I tend to interpret it psychologically</a>
00:58:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h58m47s">and I don't claim that the psychological interpretation exhausts the concept,</a>
00:58:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h58m51s">because I don't believe it does, but you see, you are a certain way and some of that way is an error</a>
00:58:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h58m59s">and then when you learn that an error has taken place, you have to let go of the conceptions that produced that error,</a>
00:58:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h59m06s">and that could be very, very painful.</a>
00:59:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h59m09s">For example, you may have entered into a relationship that was pathological,</a>
00:59:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h59m14s">and you know it's pathological but you're hooked into it and you're emotions are hooked into it and you've configured you life around it</a>
00:59:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h59m19s">and then in order to move forward, you have to let go of that, you have to admit to all the errors you made</a>
00:59:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h59m25s">including the time that was wasted and you have to allow a large part of yourself to die,</a>
00:59:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h59m31s">let's say, and you experienced that in grief and misery and sorrow and anxiety and sleepless nights and all of that,</a>
00:59:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h59m38s">but it's better than dying completely,</a>
00:59:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h59m42s">and what that indicates is that every time you learn something, large or small,</a>
00:59:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h59m48s">the part of you that was in error prior to obtaining that bit of information has to deteriorate and disappear.</a>
00:59:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h59m56s">There's pain associated with that.</a>
00:59:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=00h59m58s">But then there's the possibility for regrowth and transformation,</a>
00:59:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h00m04s">and one of the most fundamental decisions that human beings made in their lives is whether or not they're going to identify with what they are or with what they could be,</a>
01:00:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h00m11s">and if they identify with what they could be, then they have to continually let what they are die</a>
01:00:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h00m17s">so that what they could be can come forward.</a>
01:00:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h00m20s">And so to learn is to die voluntarily and be born again in great ways and small.</a>
01:00:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h00m30s">So then I wrote that speech must be untrammeled, so that dialogue can take place.</a>
01:00:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h00m40s">I think of the discussions that I've had with my wife and my kids, but primarily with my wife,</a>
01:00:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h00m48s">who's a very honest person,</a>
01:00:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h00m50s">in fact, I don't - I've been married for 28 years</a>
01:00:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h00m57s">I've known her for 45 years</a>
01:00:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h00m59s">and I'm 55 - that's a very long time, we've been friends a very long time</a>
01:00:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h01m03s">and when she first came to being with me,</a>
01:01:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h01m07s">30 years ago, I was learning some of the things that I'm talking to you about tonight,</a>
01:01:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h01m13s">and I told her that if we were going to be together,</a>
01:01:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h01m19s">that she would have to tell the truth because if she didn't tell the truth and I wouldn't know who she was,</a>
01:01:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h01m23s">and I wouldn't know where we were, I wouldn't be able to solve any problems and neither would she,</a>
01:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h01m29s">cause we'd be living a fictional relationship with one another, and that struck me as a very bad idea.</a>
01:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h01m34s">And so, she took that to heart,</a>
01:01:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h01m37s">I would say,</a>
01:01:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h01m38s">and I would also say it's like the more honest person than me.</a>
01:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h01m43s">And I'm not claiming to be spectacularly morally virtuous in any particular manner, and I'm quite aware of my multitude of faults,</a>
01:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h01m54s">but the fact that she has gripped so tightly onto the truth means that if I ever have a problem,</a>
01:01:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h02m00s">that I can talk to her and I know what she thinks.</a>
01:02:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h02m03s">And she doesn't tell me that she's right, we've learned that,</a>
01:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h02m06s">you know, because to tell someone the truth does not mean to claim that you're correct,</a>
01:02:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h02m11s">It only is to claim that you're trying to communicate the way things look to you as clearly as possible and that you're open to the possibility of correction.</a>
01:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h02m20s">Right? Because if someone can tell you how you're wrong, precisely,</a>
01:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h02m24s">exactly how you're wrong, that's such a gift,</a>
01:02:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h02m26s">and if someone is willing to tell you the truth, then you have the possibility of learning from them,</a>
01:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h02m31s">and then you have two brains instead of one.</a>
01:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h02m33s">And that's a good deal and that's actually the spiritual purpose of marriage</a>
01:02:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h02m37s">I'd say - it's to produce an union between two people that's predicated upon the truth so that the information flow between them can maximize,</a>
01:02:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h02m45s">and so that they can both be elevated above the restrictions of their own solitary biased existence.</a>
01:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h02m56s">And that facilitates, that produces the proper environment for children,</a>
01:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h03m01s">because then the children don't face the father or face the mother, they face union of the father and the mother,</a>
01:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h03m08s">and that's an invaluable force and the children will attempt to play one person off against the other</a>
01:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h03m15s">because they're tricky, because they're human and they're full of trouble and they're very good that poking and prodding and manipulating and investing</a>
01:03:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h03m25s">but they want to get a wall, they want to get a wall that doesn't move because that makes them secure</a>
01:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h03m31s">and if you have a relationship that's based on truth,</a>
01:03:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h03m33s">then you can talk about how it is that you should be with your children, for example, and you can agree upon it,</a>
01:03:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h03m38s">and then when the children push the limits as they inevitably will, they don't find something spongy, decayed and weak</a>
01:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h03m45s">they find something that's strong and sturdy and it's a wall and, of course, they can't through the wall, that's frustrating</a>
01:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h03m53s">but then they're protected by the wall and that stops them from being anxious beyond their capacity to bear.</a>
01:03:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h04m00s">And so that structure that's brought about by truthful communication builds the walls around children that allow them to play freely</a>
01:04:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h04m07s">and expand themselves and exist properly in the world.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h04m11s">and so, speech must be untrammeled so that dialogue can take place,</a>
01:04:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h04m15s">means that, well if you talk to me I want to know what you think.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h05m08s">and also has the addition the remarkable talent of being able to straighten together a list of vicious insults one after the other like no one I've ever encountered in my life.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h05m24s">It's quite comical because sometimes when we're embroiled in conflict, she'll start to do that and she'll say something so outrageous and so absolutely beyond the pale that'll make me laugh</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h05m35s">and crack up and then, of course, that's very useful because, there is something ridiculous about fighting and that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h13m25s">perhaps since the development of empirical science, which is one of the contributing factors because it's undermined our faith and our traditional religious view points</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h14m04s">I would say well, we can take that, part of that is the fundamental truth is that the fact that life is suffering is a meaning,</a>
01:14:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h14m12s">and it's a meaning that no amount of rational argumentation will rescue you from,</a>
01:14:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h14m19s">in fact,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h14m19s">the more Nihilistic you become, the more the fact that life is suffering becomes self-evident,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h14m30s">it's trying to teach you that you can't argue your way out of suffering, and so then you might as well do something about it.</a>
01:14:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h14m37s">And then, I would say well that's where you can find the meaning, it's very straightforward, there's suffering in the world and much of it is abhorrent</a>
01:14:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h14m45s">and unacceptable to anyone who attends to it, anyone who looks at it and the right answer to a child who's been beaten and abused is not</a>

01:15:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h15m16s">and that seems to be, to me, close enough to self-evidently wrong so that it's an argument that can just be dispensed with</a>
01:15:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h15m24s">so I might say to people who are wondering where to look for the meaning in their life is to take the self-evident phenomenon of suffering seriously</a>
01:15:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h15m36s">and orient themselves as rapidly as possible towards its amelioration,</a>
01:15:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h15m41s">and to work diligently towards that for a number of years and then to re-evaluate their life at the end of that and see if they think any differently about the world,</a>
01:15:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h15m49s">because they certainly will.</a>
01:15:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h15m52s">And so, the Nihilistic argument to me seems remarkably weak</a>
01:15:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h15m57s">both on its base and in depth,</a>
01:15:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h15m59s">because there are things to be done, and the things that need to be done are obvious to anyone who would open their eyes and look at them,</a>
01:15:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h16m06s">so then I would say, well, open your eyes and look what needs to be done,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h16m31s">So that suffering can be ameliorated so that we can all stumble forward. Well, why stumble?</a>
01:16:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h16m38s">Well, that's because... we stumble when we move forward because we don't know everything and so we move forward in error constantly</a>
01:16:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h16m47s">which is why we need to speak with other people and listen so that we don't stumble and fall and be unable to arise.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h16m57s">And so we stumble forward because forward movement is necessary to human beings and forward movement implies that there is something better to go to.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h17m22s">And I would say that we have ameliorated a substantial amount of suffering in the 20th century, we're doing a very good job of doing such things as combating absolute poverty,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h17m57s">and that makes me wonder just how well we could do if everyone really put their shoulders to the wheel and push.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h18m04s">And so if we get that together, then perhaps we won't degenerate into absolute chaos which is certainly something that lurks now and is a real threat,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h18m15s">we're at a crisis point as far as I can tell.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h18m19s">And we need to determine whether we want everything to go to hell,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h18m22s">which it certainly could,</a>
01:18:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h18m24s">and I wouldn't recommend that,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h18m26s">or whether or not we can work together,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h18m28s">and that brings me to the last line which is that "so that we can all stumble forward to the Kingdom of God"</a>
01:18:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h18m37s">Why would I put it that way?</a>
01:18:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h18m39s">The reason I put it that way is because, well first of all, everybody does really know what that means,</a>
01:18:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h18m44s">even though they may not believe in it, but that doesn't really matter,</a>
01:18:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h18m48s">being I think that to believe is to act and not to spout a  set of statements</a>
01:18:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h18m53s">and it is certainly possible to act as if what you are attempting to do is to bring about the Kingdom of God,</a>
01:18:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h19m01s">and I would say that doing so is something that will radically justify your miserable existence and that's really what you need,</a>
01:19:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h19m08s">is radical justification for your miserable existence, and because human beings are so powerful,</a>
01:19:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h19m15s">really powerful beyond the limits of our imagination,</a>
01:19:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h19m18s">we have no idea where our ultimate destiny might be, that it's not clear what our limits are and then if we decided to improve the place, let's say,</a>
01:19:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h19m28s">and I would say, starting with ourselves,</a>
01:19:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h19m30s">because that is the safest and humblest way to begin,</a>
01:19:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h19m34s">that there's no telling where we might end up.</a>
01:19:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h19m36s">And since we're all fragile and vulnerable creatures, and we're going to lose everything anyway,</a>
01:19:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h19m42s">we might as well risk everything to obtain the highest possible good, and then that would make the misery that constitutes our life bearable as a consequence of our intrinsic nobility.</a>
01:19:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h19m54s">And there's nothing in that except the good.</a>
01:19:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h19m57s">And so then why not do it?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h20m00s">And so that's what I would enjoy and encourage,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h20m04s">encourage everyone to do because there's nothing better to do than that and we might as well all do that which there is nothing better than!</a>
01:20:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h20m16s"><em>applause</em></a>
01:20:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h20m28s">And so I'll repeat the outline and end:</a>
01:20:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h20m39s">Now I was talking about the boundaries of free speech, and I believe that speech should be untrammeled because it's too dangerous to encapsulate with it</a>
01:20:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h20m51s">does not mean that I believe that speech, free speech comes without responsibility.</a>
01:20:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h20m57s">I believe quite the contrary, that free speech carries with it the highest responsibility</a>
01:20:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h21m03s">because if you wish the right to speak, you wish to shoulder the responsibility of speaking.</a>
01:21:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h21m10s">Then you have to contend with the fact that your words are the force that shapes the world,</a>
01:21:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h21m16s">and with every word that you utter, things tilt slightly heaven-ward or slightly hell-ward</a>
01:21:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h21m24s">and that that responsibility rests firmly on your shoulders, and it's inescapable.</a>
01:21:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h21m29s">And that's a terrible thing to realize although it's a very meaningful thing to realize</a>
01:21:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h21m35s">and people say that they would like their life to be meaningful, but that's a questionable claim because</a>
01:21:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h21m41s">to recognize your life as meaningful is to understand that everything you do matters and that what it means for things to matter is that you're deciding, in some sense,</a>
01:21:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h21m51s">between Heaven on Earth and Hell on Earth with every decision that you make.</a>
01:21:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h21m55s">And the decisions that you make echo far beyond you in ways that are almost incomprehensible,</a>
01:21:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h22m01s">and that the destiny of the world is determined by the collective decisions of all the individuals that make up the world</a>
01:22:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h22m09s">and that we're all locked together deciding in which metaphysical direction our little planet will go.</a>
01:22:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h22m19s">So free speech carries with a heavy responsibility, but the responsibility is something you want because it justifies the suffering of existence.</a>
01:22:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h22m28s">I said that life is suffering; love is the desire to see unnecessary suffering ameliorated,</a>
01:22:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h22m37s">Truth is the hand maiden of love; dialogue is the pathway to truth</a>
01:22:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h22m46s">Humility, that's recognition of personal insufficiency and the willingness to learn; to learn is to die voluntarily and to be born again in great ways and small.</a>
01:22:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h23m02s">So speech must be untrammeled so that dialogue can take place, so that we can all humbly learn,</a>
01:23:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h23m09s">so that truth can serve love, so that suffering can be ameliorated,</a>
01:23:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h23m14s">so that we can all stumble forward towards the Kingdom of God.</a>
01:23:14</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h24m02s">Well now, we'd like to take the opportunity to open things up for question and answer,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h24m07s">and what we'd like to do is have a line from right up here, and I'll be sitting there with a microphone</a>

01:24:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h25m04s">and we're alone, and we're...we don't know how to bring people together,</a>
01:25:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h25m12s">it's like a death trap up there, bringing people together is monster building (?)</a>
01:25:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h25m18s">How...what is it that people are resonating to that we can use that can bring people together so that we can talk about solutions?</a>
01:25:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h25m43s">You know, I watch this Netflix special with Russel Peters,</a>
01:25:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h25m49s">and Russel Peters, for those of you who don't know, is a Canadian comic, he's of Indian decent,</a>
01:25:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h25m55s">he was raised in a suburb in Toronto , which makes him him, I would say, peculiarly Canadian</a>
01:25:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h26m02s">and he's very simile to the Canadian culture,</a>
01:26:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h26m07s">and Russel has made his living insulting every racial and ethnic group that he can possibly insult</a>
01:26:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h26m16s">and it's so interesting because he filled an entire arena in London, I think it's the most people that had ever gathered together to see a comedian before</a>
01:26:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h26m28s">and it was a United Nations in the arena</a>
01:26:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h26m32s">you know, the Arabs were there and the Jews were there and the Russians were there and the South Americans were there,</a>
01:26:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h26m40s">and every group was waiting with their tongues out so that Russel could insult their particular ethnicity</a>
01:26:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h26m48s">so that they can feel finally that someone was saying something that was truthful,</a>
01:26:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h26m53s">and not hiding, and to say it openly in some sense and to make light of it</a>
01:26:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h26m58s">And I would say, you bring people together by telling them what you think.</a>
01:26:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h27m10s">Without manipulation and without care for the outcome and people can handle very rough truths if they trust who is stating them</a>
01:27:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h27m17s">and Peters is trusted by everyone because he is, I suppose,</a>
01:27:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h27m23s">non-indiscriminately prejudiced.</a>
01:27:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h27m26s">He hates everyone equally.</a>
01:27:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h27m36s">There's nothing behind his assaults except the desire for everyone to come together in recognition of their idiocy and vulnerability and people very much enjoy that.</a>
01:27:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h27m43s">And so I would say, you unite people to the degree that they can be united by saying what you think without trying to manipulate the outcome.</a>
01:27:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h27m52s">And so, and that's a better way to live anyways because you don't have to keep track of anything that way and that's so nice.</a>
01:27:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h27m59s">Say what you think, carefully, you observe the response and adjust your behavior,</a>

01:29:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h29m47s">Well, that's a cool question, I think you just retold the story of the Fall in Genesis.</a>
01:29:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h29m56s">You see, and I mean that,</a>
01:29:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h29m58s">because, as far as I can tell, what that story means is that,</a>
01:29:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h30m03s">at some point in time,</a>
01:30:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h30m07s">people became conceptional and sophisticated enough to understand their own vulnerability,</a>
01:30:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h30m14s">to realize their own nakedness, to discover death, to discover the necessity of work,</a>
01:30:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h30m20s">and to be blown out of that pre-conscious paradise into the tragic domain of history</a>
01:30:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h30m27s">I believe that's what that story means, and you can read that as a tragic catastrophe with no solution.</a>
01:30:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h30m35s">And I would say though, however, that since that time and God only knows when that was,</a>
01:30:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h30m40s">the human race has been collectively attempting to address that problem,</a>
01:30:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h30m45s">and the solution that's emerged is something like: although a little bit of excess consciousness demolish us, a lot more consciousness could save us.</a>
01:30:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h30m59s">And I think that that's the case.</a>
01:30:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h31m01s">There's no going back, right?</a>
01:31:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h31m04s">Alcohol makes you unconscious, for example , and that's part of why people like it, and it's not surprising; sedatives do that,</a>
01:31:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h31m12s">the things that people do to themselves to destroy their consciousness, by distraction, do that.</a>
01:31:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h31m18s">They alleviate the terrible catastrophe of being more awake than it's easy to bear,</a>
01:31:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h31m24s">but it's the wrong solution.</a>
01:31:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h31m27s">The right solution is to be even more awake,</a>
01:31:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h31m29s">and to pay even more attention.</a>
01:31:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h31m31s">And there's a way out of the problem that way.</a>
01:31:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h31m34s">And so, the fall, the idea of the fall indicates that there's something about people that's irredeemably damaged, well perhaps not irredeemably,</a>
01:31:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h31m45s">but seriously damaged, right?</a>
01:31:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h31m47s">There's a schism in being, let's say, that's not easy to rectify.</a>
01:31:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h31m53s">That's what the story indicates, and I think it's tightly tied with the kind of evolutionary process that you were just commenting on,</a>
01:31:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h32m00s">the Irish elk has developed its excess antlers, the theory goes as a consequence of female sexual selection</a>
01:32:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h32m09s">of course, female human beings are very choosy maters unlike chimpanzees, let's say,</a>
01:32:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h32m15s">and there's reasonable evidence that one of the factors that compelled our cortical evolution forward was female sexual choosiness.</a>
01:32:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h32m22s">And that's why perhaps that Eve attempts Adam into self-consciousness in Genesis,</a>
01:32:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h32m29s">and maybe that's why there's been even eternal lamenting between men and women for their sins, because women certainly do make men self-conscious</a>
01:32:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h32m36s">it might be the primary effect that women have on men,</a>
01:32:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h32m41s">that's advantageous in that more conscious men are better but it's disadvantageous for in that self-consciousness is generally a very unpleasant emotion.</a>
01:32:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h32m49s">So I would say, however, that self-consciousness is the guide way to transcendence and development,</a>
01:32:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h32m55s">and so the best thing for human beings to do is to bear up under their self-conscious tragedy and to transcend pass that by becoming even more conscious.</a>
01:32:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h33m05s">And I think that's the hope that we have, I think that's what the great religions of the world constantly dangle before us,</a>
01:33:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h33m13s">is that if you are suffering in your half-awake state, then it's time to wake up completely and that perhaps that will go away,</a>
01:33:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h33m20s">well we don't know but, we don't have a better option</a>
01:33:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h33m23s">the other option is annihilation, and seems a bit premature, shall we say?</a>
01:33:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h33m35s">Given that we're not all we could be, it seems a bit premature.</a>
01:33:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h33m43s">In some of your YouTube videos, you talked about the ancient mythology of Babylon and Egypt,</a>
01:33:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h33m50s">and you've described it as a way that they "act out,"</a>
01:33:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h33m55s">what they sensed to be true but even because they couldn't articulate,</a>
01:33:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h34m01s">is there a modern day equivalent of acting out the truth, and if so, can you describe it for us?</a>
01:34:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h34m14s">Well I would say that, in large part, Christianity is the example of that,</a>
01:34:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h34m24s">it's fundamentally a description of pattern of being, an optimized pattern of being, I would say</a>
01:34:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h34m31s">and the way that it was generated, and again, this is a psychological interpretation, and I don't claim that it's exhaust of not talking the least,</a>
01:34:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h34m41s">is that you can imagine that as people move through time, this is again the idea that the figure of Christ is implicit in the Old Testament,</a>
01:34:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h34m51s">which is also a psychological idea,</a>
01:34:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h34m53s">imagine that as people progress through time, they observe that some people were handling existence better than others,</a>
01:34:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h35m00s">and those people attracted attention.</a>
01:35:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h35m04s">And admiration. And stories were generated about them.</a>
01:35:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h35m08s">So you might say that out of a hundred people, the most capable and honorable and respectable and useful and benevolent person was identified</a>
01:35:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h35m18s">and then celebrated as least with admiration, and thenperhaps with stories</a>
01:35:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h35m23s">and so then you might imagine that there were ten groups of a hundred people, and each of them had their story about the most admirable person</a>
01:35:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h35m32s">and then those stories came together as those tribes amalgamated , and then the story of the ten most admirable people was amalgamated into</a>
01:35:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h35m41s">a figure that was the most admirable of those ten and then the entire group of ten one hundred tribes, people could come together under that banner,</a>
01:35:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h35m51s">and it really looks like in some sense that's how monotheism emerged out of polytheism,</a>
01:35:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h35m55s">is that the tribal groups had their local ideals, let's say, and when they come together those local ideals were amalgamated into you may describe as a meta-ideal,</a>
01:35:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h36m01s">and people were able to unite under that meta-ideal, so for example, in Mesopotamia,</a>
01:36:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h36m11s">the was a God, known as Martyr, and Martyr kept a very large number of names,</a>
01:36:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h36m17s">some of which are quite fascinating, and the reason that he had a large number of names is because he was an amalgam of a very large number of previous Gods.</a>
01:36:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h36m33s">So you know there's an idea, a Christian idea, for example, that Christ was the King of kings, let's say</a>
01:36:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h36m40s">the hero of heroes, and from a psychological perspective, I just read that as a straightforward observation,</a>
01:36:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h36m48s">that as the stories of the great people of the past amalgamated, out of that emerged in the human imagination,</a>
01:36:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h36m57s">a conceptualization of the ideal, it's a very strange conceptualization</a>
01:36:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h37m04s">because it involves something like the voluntary acceptance of suffering and its simultaneous transcendence.</a>
01:37:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h37m15s">And that's a kin in some sense the old stories of the hero who fights the dragon, because of course, in some sense, the ultimate dragon is, well death</a>
01:37:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h37m22s">and also the malevolence that might produce an unjust death</a>
01:37:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h37m30s">and to be able to face that without shrinking is perhaps the essential hallmark of the most well developed character,</a>
01:37:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h37m38s">and that ideal is a product of the collective imagination of humanity, from a psychological perspective,</a>
01:37:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h37m46s">what it means beyond that, if anything, I'm in no position to determine.</a>
01:37:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h38m01s">My question was how...do you have any thoughts or recommendations about how will we speak the truth?</a>
01:38:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h38m09s">(inaudible sounds...but don't worry, Dr. Peterson will repeat the question later)</a>
01:38:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h38m24s">Okay, so the question is, how do you speak truth in a highly hierarchal environment, like a work place where perhaps you have disagreeable or even tyrannical managers and a resistance to the truth?</a>
01:38:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h38m35s">Well, that's an excellent question.</a>
01:38:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h38m38s">The first thing I would say is, you prepare yourself</a>
01:38:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h38m42s">and so, if you want to negotiate, for example, you can't negotiate from a position of weakness,</a>
01:38:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h38m49s">because you lose.</a>
01:38:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h38m50s">You'll lose in every way. You can't withstand a conflict; you've got nothing to fall back on.</a>
01:38:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h38m55s">So if you're in a workplace that's not amendable to informative messages, let's say,</a>
01:38:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h39m04s">the first thing you do is look for another job.</a>
01:39:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h39m09s">I don't mean that you take another job, that isn't what I mean,</a>
01:39:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h39m13s">I mean that you need to provide yourself with credible options.</a>
01:39:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h39m18s">Because otherwise, you'll be weak when you stand for it.</a>
01:39:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h39m22s">and especially someone who's a bully will just bully you right over</a>
01:39:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h39m27s">because you've got no power.</a>
01:39:27</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h45m57s">There won't be a man in the humanities in ten years, and in most of the social sciences as well,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h46m10s">but, more tellingly, even as that the overall proportion of enrollment amongst students in the humanities has declined every decades since the 1960's</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h47m52s">And what I gave you tonight is really the best answer that I have.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h48m10s">to organize yourself as well as you possibly can and to get those things around you that aren't in order in order,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h48m29s">And I think that power is not insignificant, not at all.</a>

01:48:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h49m06s">So my question is, um, because this Truth idea really, really interests me, do you feel that because the limits of your own human experience and your own identity,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h49m30s">which I think is a better way of putting it,</a>
01:49:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h49m35s">one of those is that is better to serve being than to denounce it,</a>
01:49:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h49m40s">and that it's better to not lie, let's say, instead of telling the truth because someone asked earlier, you know, how do you go about the truth, and in some sense you can't, but you can stop saying things you know to be false.</a>
01:49:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h49m58s">Which is a good start, and that's within anyone's grasp then I would say, I'm not likely to change my mind about the utility of doing that either</a>
01:49:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h50m05s">because I've decided that I'm going to accept the consequences of doing that gratefully, regardless of what the consequences are.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h50m36s">and that doesn't give you any guarantee, precisely, you know? Because even if you act out, let's say, the heroic path, and you face the dragon in combat, there's no necessary...it's not a necessity that you win.</a>

01:53:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h53m17s">So I was just wondering, based on history and whatnot that you go into discuss, like the Gulag Archipelago and whatnot,</a>
01:53:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h53m30s">what kind of role do you think the government should play in society?</a>
01:53:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h53m46s">I think that it depends on the circumstances</a>
01:53:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h53m51s">and so, I don't think that that's the right question.</a>
01:53:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h53m55s">I think the right question is: how should the government constitute itself so that it can respond flexibly  the demands of the situation?</a>
01:53:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h54m06s">I believe that there's utility in the conservative viewpoint, and I believe that there's utility in the liberal viewpoint, but that it depends on the specifics of the situation.</a>
01:54:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h54m18s">And that there is also error, and even catastrophic error on both sides.</a>
01:54:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h54m23s">So that the government needs to be constituted, I would say, much like it is in the West</a>
01:54:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h54m29s">where sovereignty is instantiated into people for better or worse, so that people can learn from their errors.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h54m37s">And that we progress by engaging in dialogue across people of different temperamental types.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h54m46s">Because sometimes the boarders are too open, and they need to be tightened; and sometimes the boarders are too closed, and they need to be loosened.</a>
01:54:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h54m56s">If the boarders between everything become completely closed, then everything dies, right?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h55m03s">And everything dies. There's endless mythological representation of that being part of the reason that Egypt, for example,</a>
01:55:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h55m09s">and the Mosaic story is a Kingdom of sand and stone, because sand and stone lack water,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h55m19s">is a master of water.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h55m21s">And the message in that story is that sometimes the Kingdom turns to stone,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h55m25s">and it's a tyranny.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h55m33s">But then there are times when, like the story for example,</a>
01:55:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h55m39s">there are times when there's too much influx of information, that's a flood, that's one way of reading the flood story,</a>
01:55:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h55m47s">is that there's just too much pouring in, and everyone drowns</a>
01:55:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h55m51s">and what we have to always ask ourselves is: are we tending the guard properly?</a>
01:55:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h55m57s">It's not drying out from lack of water, it's not drowning because there's too much moisture coming in,</a>
01:55:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h56m03s">and the only way we can determine that is by paying attention and communicating, and that's why free speech is such a fundamental necessity.</a>
01:56:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h56m10s">So it's not precisely what the government can do, because it has to do many things,</a>
01:56:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h56m15s">but, because it's the society of people and people have to do many things</a>
01:56:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h56m20s">but how the government goes about in making its decisions</a>
01:56:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h56m24s">And then, at least what the government has to do is protect those, what we call rare and precious processes, that enable it to continue to be a responsive and alive entity.</a>
01:56:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h56m36s">And I think we have done a remarkably good job at that in the West,</a>
01:56:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h56m40s">and I think that the US is a great example of that.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h56m43s">For all its flaws, everything is flawed, but the proper analysis is flawed compared to what?</a>
01:56:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h56m52s">And the answer isn't to the hypothetical utopia of your imagination, the answer is to other similar systems that have actually existed in time and space.</a>
01:56:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h57m00s">And by that measure, I would say that the West is doing spectacularly well.</a>
01:57:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h57m05s">And I don't think that we should sink it.</a>
01:57:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h57m08s">Because of...because we're ignorant about its value.</a>
01:57:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h57m22s">About the Postmodern philosophers that you've mentioned that's having particularly threatening and destructive ideas</a>
01:57:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h57m30s">that cause people to question and re-silent our culture, like you've mentioned Foucault,</a>
01:57:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h57m36s">who has mentioned Egypt as his inspiration, so I wonder how might somebody like Foucault or someone like me who can think along with somebody like Foucault get each other along(?)</a>
01:57:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h57m52s">Well, I've read a reasonable amount of Foucault</a>
01:57:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h57m57s">and I would say that among the Postmodernists he's rather remarkable in the fact that you can actually understand what he say.</a>
01:57:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h58m05s">I don't find what he wrote particularly surprising, like the idea that mental illness is in part a social construct,</a>
01:58:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h58m14s">is...if you're a reasonably educated clinician, that's more than self-evident</a>
01:58:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h58m21s">in that virtually every complex activity that human beings engage in is culturally determined to a large degree.</a>
01:58:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h58m28s">It's Derrida that I have the most problem with.</a>
01:58:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h58m32s">And I also know that he put his finger on a very complex problem, which is that the central Postmodernist claim is that every situation allows for a potentially infinite number of interpretations,</a>
01:58:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h58m46s">which is true.</a>
01:58:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h58m47s">And therefore it's difficult to determine which interpretation should be held up as paramount.</a>
01:58:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h58m55s">Now, that's true. In fact, the artificial intelligence researchers ran into that when they were trying to design systems that can perceive the world</a>
01:58:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h59m02s">because the original idea was that perceiving the world is easy, because it's just made out of things,</a>
01:59:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h59m07s">and that learning how to manipulate those things and act upon them would be the complicated problem</a>
01:59:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h59m13s">but it actually turned about that perception was the complicated problem because there's an indefinite number of ways  to perceive things.</a>
01:59:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h59m20s">Now, the reason that Postmodernists were wrong was that there aren't indefinite number of interpretations of the world that don't kill you.</a>
01:59:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h59m30s">Or make others kill you.</a>
01:59:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h59m32s">There's a very constraint number of interpretations that allow you to continue to exist and equally importantly,</a>
01:59:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h59m39s">to allow you to continue to exist in the presence of other people.</a>
01:59:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h59m42s">So although, there are many interpretations that you can ferret out of the Shakespeare kit, your job is to ferret out one that helps you live properly.</a>
01:59:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h59m52s">And that's hypothetically the goal of the guides to great literature</a>
01:59:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=01h59m56s">And so I think the Postmodernists radically overplayed their hand,</a>
01:59:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h00m00s">and that's particularly true for Derrida,</a>
02:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h00m02s">and I think the people who follow Derrida are in many cases doing so because it's hell of a lot easier than actually doing the difficult job of extracting the useful tools from the literature of the world,</a>
02:00:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h00m15s">which is what you do when you read, you extract out useful tools</a>
02:00:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h00m18s">With regards to Nietzsche, Nietzsche said something about everything.</a>
02:00:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h00m23s">And so every philosopher of the modern age, one way or another, is deeply influenced by Nietzsche.</a>
02:00:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h00m30s">And the problem with Nietzsche is that he was a figure prolific beyond comprehension, virtually, I mean,</a>
02:00:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h00m41s">recently I did, I think it was a 45 minute video on one paragraph of Nietzsche's "Beyond Good and Evil" and you know, I've barely started to scrape the surface of it,</a>
02:00:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h00m48s">and of course he has multiple books.</a>
02:00:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h00m51s">So Nietzsche is a very strange character, and he said that he philosophies with a hammer and he meant it.</a>
02:00:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h00m58s">And his critque of Christianity was devastating, I would say,</a>
02:00:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h01m03s">but I would also say, and this is a rather shocking comparison, that the role Nietzsche played with regard to Christianity was the same role a maggot can play at a wound,</a>
02:01:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h01m16s">which is that it can devour nothing but diseased flesh and leave what's healthy behind</a>
02:01:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h01m20s">and I think that there is a reading of Nietzsche that allows for precisely that.</a>
02:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h01m25s">You know, when he said that God was dead,</a>
02:01:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h01m28s">he also said that that would be a catastrophe, the lights with which we could not even imagine</a>
02:01:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h01m33s">and society itself would oscillate back and forth murderously for centuries as a consequence.</a>
02:01:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h01m38s">So wasn't triumphant.</a>
02:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h01m40s">And he strove to find out what an alternative to that might be and he formulated the idea of over-man (ubermensch), essentially, right?</a>
02:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h01m48s">The superman who was capable of creating his own values, and I think that Nietzsche made a mistake there, and I think it was a mistake that was rectified by Carl Jung,</a>
02:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h01m57s">because Jung knew that...I think Jung was really the first person, although Nietzsche has intimations of this,</a>
02:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h02m04s">because Nietzsche does say that our drives philosophies, right? which is very biologically oriented observation.</a>
02:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h02m12s">But what Jung noted was that well we don't create our own values because the values are implicit within us, but we can rediscover them, and that's partly why he was so interested is analysis in mythology and the unconscious.</a>
02:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h02m24s">And so, I think that Postmodernists took the part of Nietzsche that's only destructive to its final conclusion, and that's actually what's being played out now.</a>
02:02:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h02m36s">Derrida's critique of modern civilization is Phallogocentric, right? male dominated, centered around the idea of the logos - he regarded that as nothing but a tool of oppression and marginalization.</a>
02:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h02m49s">And there's some truth in that because whenever you produce a value system, you also exclude things from the value system as not valuable, obviously</a>
02:02:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h02m58s">but the problem I think that the Postmodernists won't address is that the alternative to creating value systems and dealing with the exlusion that comes with that is to drown in Nihilistic chaos,</a>
02:02:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h03m13s">and worse, while you're drowning in Nihilistic chaos, you're going to call out forces of totalitarian order.</a>
02:03:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h03m21s">And so it's no solution.</a>
02:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h03m22s">And what I see Postmodernism doing to students, generally speaking, is demoralize them completely.</a>
02:03:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h03m29s">You know, they come to university looking to catalyze their identity,</a>
02:03:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h03m33s">often clinging to last remaining shred of their culture that's just what's keeping them afloat and all that Postmodernist professors do is take those remaining fragments that are allowing them to stay above the water and</a>
02:03:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h03m45s">tell them that they're illusory and take them away.</a>
02:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h03m48s">It's like well now you're free.</a>
02:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h03m50s">It's like I've dropped you in the middle of the ocean, you can swim in any direction you want,</a>
02:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h03m55s">you're free.</a>
02:03:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h03m57s">And I think that that's rooted in large part, even in hatred of youth. I really believe that.</a>
02:03:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h04m03s">Because why would you cripple people if you didn't hate them?</a>
02:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h04m06s">And so there's hatred of humanity lurking at the bottom of the worst access of the idealogues in general.</a>
02:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h04m11s">You know, you hear this from environmentalists sometime, I've heard this many times: the planet will be better off if there were no people on it.</a>
02:04:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h04m18s">It's like, well let's keep you away from the third nuclear weapons, shall we?</a>
02:04:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h04m31s">So it's not easy to come up with canonical interpretation of Nietzsche, there's no doubt about that,</a>
02:04:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h04m36s">but, again, I would say,</a>
02:04:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h04m38s">I thought for a long time, from a psychological perspective, I tried to understand, whether it was Nietzsche's philosophy that drove him insane.</a>
02:04:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h04m47s">But I think the evidence for that is non-existent, I think he did suffer from a degenerative brain disease of great severity</a>
02:04:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h04m54s">and I actually think that his fundamental philosophy which I've read - I've read everything he wrote because there's been new books published, but I read his great works in chronological order</a>
02:04:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h05m02s">I think his fundamental philosophy is affirmative, not negative.</a>
02:05:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h05m08s">But he's a critic, you know? and he wanted to find something that he can stand on and that's what critics do</a>
02:05:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h05m14s">if you're a real critic, you're not looking to destroy, you're looking for something that you can stand on</a>
02:05:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h05m18s">And Nietzsche was certainly very useful to me and I know he was also extraordinarily useful to Carl Jung, who's a real student of Nietzsche,</a>
02:05:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h05m25s">and he was really devoting himself to solving the problem that Nietzsche posed, which is what do we do in the aftermath of the death of God?</a>
02:05:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h05m33s">And Jung's answer was: we rescue our father from the depth, and that's the right answer; that's what universities should be doing with young people,</a>
02:05:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h05m40s">it's like your dead father's in the library</a>
02:05:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h05m42s">go out there and fought(?) and ferret him out, right? and unite with him, and become the thing that keeps chaos at bay.</a>
02:05:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8#t=02h05m59s">On that note, this concludes our talk with Jordan Peterson, please join me in thanking him again for joining us!</a>
