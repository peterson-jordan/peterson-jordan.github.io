00:00:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h00m13s">After I started reading and Nicci's Beyond Good and Evil I came upon a paragraph in his</a>
00:00:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h00m21s">Chapter on scholars that really really bothered me, and it's actually bothers me to this day</a>
00:00:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h00m26s">He talked about this kind of person like they were just a mirror-like</a>
00:00:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h00m31s">They stretched</a>
00:00:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h00m32s">He said every part of their skin basically to allow every new piece of information that they took</a>
00:00:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h00m37s">On and that all they ever were was just an instrument</a>
00:00:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h00m40s">They were just a mirror on reflecting what they had learned never actually having generated anything on their own</a>
00:00:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h00m47s">And it's it's bothered me because I feel like in a way it's sort of like</a>
00:00:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h00m51s">It's it's it's impacted my identity a lot because I don't know how are you supposed to create something you know okay?</a>
00:00:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h00m58s">Well, that's okay that that's a really good question</a>
00:00:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h01m01s">I mean Nietzsche is often classed with the existentialists right and so one of the tenants of existentialist</a>
00:01:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h01m07s">There's two real tenants of existentialism</a>
00:01:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h01m10s">There's more but obviously we're oversimplifying</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h01m13s">But one is that life is a problem it isn't because there's something wrong with you</a>
00:01:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h01m19s">It's that life is a problem, and so that's often contrasted with the Freudian view which is that if you have a problem?</a>
00:01:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h01m26s">It's because something went wrong during your development the existentialist said no no it's like</a>
00:01:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h01m32s">Life is a problem make no mistake about it and that</a>
00:01:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h01m44s">The purpose of</a>
00:01:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h01m47s"> scholarship is in some sense to solve that problem and</a>
00:01:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h01m52s">So for Nietzsche like he said all truths are bloody truths to me and what he meant by that was that</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h01m59s">if an idea didn't</a>
00:01:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h02m01s">incarnate itself in you and</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h02m03s">Transform your perceptions and your actions, then you were merely possessed by the idea you were merely a spokesperson for the idea</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h02m10s">Or you could say that the idea possessed you you're a puppet for the idea</a>
00:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h02m14s">It's not you</a>
00:02:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h02m16s">It's the idea is in you and it has you</a>
00:02:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h02m19s">You haven't taken the idea and incorporated with you and made it part of your life, and so there's a romanticism</a>
00:02:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h02m26s">That's associated with that right. That's the passionate scholar the person for whom ideas are not merely</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h02m33s">They're not merely what would you call?</a>
00:02:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h02m36s">abstracted</a>
00:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h02m38s">representations that can be tossed about as if they're</a>
00:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h02m42s">Commodities, they're they're they're more like pert. They're more like personalities that might be another way of thinking about it and so</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h02m50s">If you're if if those ideas are compelling then you don't</a>
00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h02m56s">Like one thing I learned a long time ago, and I think this is probably relevant</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h03m00s">I know when I was a kid</a>
00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h03m02s">I liked to argue and I liked to win arguments or or or lose them, although I liked winning them a lot better</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h03m09s">But I didn't really mind so much what the content of the argument was</a>
00:03:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h03m13s">You know I could engage in it like a sparring match</a>
00:03:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h03m18s">And it was in some sense to establish dominance right to establish intellectual dominance. I quit doing that when I was in my mid-20s</a>
00:03:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h03m25s">because I</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h03m26s">Thought that that was too shallow an approach to the ideas they they're not</a>
00:03:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h03m32s">commodities of</a>
00:03:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h03m34s">That sort they're there. They have tendrils that reach down into the living</a>
00:03:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h03m39s">That's the right way to think about it and so Nietzsche's criticism of scholars</a>
00:03:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h03m43s">And he did this a lot was that they were bloodless. You know they didn't they were full of performative contradictions</a>
00:03:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h03m51s">That's another way of thinking about. They'd say one thing and do another because their intellect was completely dissociated from from their actions and</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h03m59s">Heath he he thought that was a very bad idea, and I think that that's a good criticism</a>
00:03:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h04m05s">I think it is a bad idea. I also think it makes for an extraordinarily boring lecturer</a>
00:04:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h04m10s">You know because you can tell if you're listening to someone</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h04m13s">whether the ideas that you're hearing are merely being passed through the person as if they're being memorized say or</a>
00:04:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h04m19s">whether they're part of the dynamic core of the person and</a>
00:04:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h04m23s">If they're part of the dynamic core of the person then they're almost always engaging and gripping</a>
00:04:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h04m28s">And so he wasn't a fan of bloodless scholars, and I think that's correct because one of the things that I see</a>
00:04:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h04m36s">It's not a good idea to have ideas possess you unless</a>
00:04:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h04m41s">You know what the ideas are up to and</a>
00:04:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h04m43s">lots of people are possessed by ideas rather than possessing them and that what that means is they haven't taken the ideas and</a>
00:04:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h04m50s">integrated them into their own being</a>
00:04:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h04m52s">They haven't it's like an incarnation in a sense. They haven't incarnated the ideas in</a>
00:04:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h04m59s">embodied form and</a>
00:04:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h05m01s">So they're incomplete</a>
00:05:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h05m03s">you know Nietzsche also in thus spake Zarathustra when Zarathustra comes down the mountain he sees a bunch of people gathered around a</a>
00:05:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h05m11s">Famous individual, I think maybe a scholar</a>
00:05:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h05m13s">but it doesn't really matter and when</a>
00:05:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h05m15s">Zarathustra goes and looks at the person all he sees is a little tiny midget with a gigantic ear and</a>
00:05:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h05m20s">So he's a hyper specialist right and so he has a pretty impressive ear, but he's only this big</a>
00:05:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h05m25s">and that was Nietzsche's imagistic commentary on the danger of hyper specialization and</a>
00:05:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h05m31s">Also on the danger of adulation for hyper specialization and and because he thought about it as a kind of deformity</a>
00:05:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h05m38s">now Nietzsche was a pretty harsh guy but</a>
00:05:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h05m44s">But he did address the issue of the relationship between</a>
00:05:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h05m48s">intellectual knowledge and action because for Nietzsche those things are not to be separated in some sense so</a>
00:05:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h05m56s">Yeah, so maybe I don't know why it maybe it bothered you</a>
00:05:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h06m01s">Like it's hard to say why I bothered you it might have bothered you because it's sort of undermined the idea of scholar</a>
00:06:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h06m07s">But the other possibility and this isn't an accusation because of I don't know anything about you</a>
00:06:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h06m11s">But it might also be that it struck a chord. You know and that maybe you were doubtful or</a>
00:06:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h06m18s">questioning how tightly</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h06m31s">I mean</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taF8yk7MRV8#t=00h06m31s">that's a really good thing to think about because generally speaking that integration is it is very much lacking people are a lot smarter and</a>
