					<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h00m00s">Jordan Peterson has hundreds of hours of interviews and lectures on YouTube</a>
00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h00m03s">but with so much volume it can be tough to distill the essence of his life philosophy.</a>
00:00:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h00m08s">And to make things even more difficult, he sometimes uses abstract language like this.</a>
00:00:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h00m12s">It's within the individual that redemption can be... manifested, let's say.</a>
00:00:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h00m17s">And even in so far as the state is concerned because the state's proper functioning</a>
00:00:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h00m21s">is dependent on the proper functioning of the individual
rather than the reverse, most fundamentally.</a>
00:00:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h00m26s">That is actually the most concise explanation of his life philosophy that I've heard but</a>
00:00:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h00m30s">what does it mean concretely?</a>
00:00:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h00m33s">Today we're going to break down the three things that you should and should not do</a>
00:00:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h00m36s">in order to live an exceptional life according to Dr. Peterson.</a>
00:00:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h00m40s">And I'm going to simplify as best as I can in order to keep
this simple to understand; forgive me for that Dr. Peterson.</a>
00:00:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h00m46s">Also, at the end, I'm going to get some concrete actions to you</a>
00:00:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h00m50s">that you can take today in order to move forward on each point.</a>
00:00:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h00m53s">But first, the thing that you need to start with is fixing
yourself before you fix the world — not the reverse.</a>
00:00:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h01m00s">So many of us think that life is unfair — that society that we've been born into is unfair —</a>
00:01:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h01m05s">and the only way to progress is to change things on a societal level but as Jordan says —</a>
00:01:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h01m10s">...so and can you even clean up your own room? No.</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h01m12s">Well, you should think about that. You should think about that</a>
00:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h01m18s">because if you can't even clean up your own room,
who the hell are you to give advice to the world?</a>
00:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h01m23s">Think of it in terms of leadership; if you want to lead other people,
you need to prove that you can do it first by leading yourself.</a>
00:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h01m29s">You need to motivate yourself, you need to inspire yourself, and need to prove</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h01m33s">that following your strategies is actually a desirable thing that leads to desirable results.</a>
00:01:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h01m38s">And the truth is, today, that might not be the case given where your life is at.</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h01m42s">So where do you start leading yourself? Well, here's some suggestions.</a>
00:01:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h01m46s">Clean up your room. That's a good start.</a>
00:01:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h01m49s">Organize your local landscape. Schedule your time. Start taking control of yourself.</a>
00:01:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h01m54s">See if you can stop saying things you know to be lies.</a>
00:01:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h01m57s">To those suggestions, I would add — addressing your health,</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h02m00s">repairing your relationship with family members,
volunteering, meditating, moving forward in your career...</a>
00:02:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h02m06s">but certainly, the most fundamental tenet of fixing yourself up is to tell the truth</a>
00:02:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h02m11s">which is actually Jordans second-core tenet.</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h02m15s">Here he is talking about how that is actually the highest good.</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h02m18s">It's a deep idea; it's the deepest idea of the West, I would say
and it's the deepest religious idea</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h02m23s">The idea is that there's a way to bring order into being</a>
00:02:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h02m28s">that makes the order good and that's to bring it into being by spoken truth.</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h02m34s">Now, we have all been told not to lie before but we were usually</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h02m38s">commanded to tell the truth because it was the, quote-unquote, right thing to do</a>
00:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h02m42s">and it may have actually felt like telling the truth left you're worse off;</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h02m45s">after all, it might have prevented you from getting what you wanted
or forced you into making an uncomfortable confession.</a>
00:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h02m51s">But that is actually not Jordan Peterson's
main reason for insisting on the truth; this is —</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h02m56s">If I tell the truth as carefully as I can then whatever happens</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h03m01s">is the best that could have possibly happened in that situation no matter how it looks.</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h03m05s">That seems like a crazy idea. After all, there can be terrible consequences</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h03m11s">to the truth sometimes which is why we avoid it in the first place.</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h03m14s">So let's just take an example and play it out.</a>
00:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h03m17s">For instance, say that you have a boss who routinely verbally abuses employees.</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h03m21s">Telling the truth and standing up for yourself saying that this isn't okay might get you fired</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h03m26s">or if you don't get fired, it could get you singled out to receive even more punishment.</a>
00:03:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h03m30s">That would be bad but according to Peterson's philosophy, it would still be better</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h03m35s">than not telling the truth because maybe getting singled out would force you</a>
00:03:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h03m40s">to actually live the truth — you'd have to quit because you just couldn't take it anymore.</a>
00:03:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h03m44s">And that might build self-esteem because you're betting on yourself to figure things out</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h03m48s">despite the financial circumstances that were very dire.</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h03m51s">And it might set an example for the other people in the company</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h03m54s">and if you did make it back on your feet in six months,</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h03m56s">that example might inspire them to escape such a tyrannical leader as well.</a>
00:03:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h04m00s">Even more, you would become the type of person who is honest despite their fear</a>
00:04:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h04m06s">and that is someone that other people gravitate towards and are inspired by.</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h04m10s">And maybe, just maybe, the boss would actually reform his or her ways</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h04m14s">and things would get better immediately.</a>
00:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h04m17s">The point is, you might not see how telling the truth is the best thing for you —</a>
00:04:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h04m21s">it might look like it's horrible idea — but it is inevitably good for you and good the world.</a>
00:04:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h04m27s">And there are plenty of archetypal stories that drive this point home including Aladdin</a>
00:04:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h04m32s">where Aladdin first refuses to tell the truth
because it seems like he'd lose everything if he did.</a>
00:04:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h04m37s">Genie, I need help.</a>
00:04:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h04m39s">Alright, Sparky, here's the deal.</a>
00:04:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h04m41s">If you wanna court the little lady, you gotta be a straight-shooter. Do you got it?</a>
00:04:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h04m45s">What?</a>
00:04:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h04m46s">Tell her the TRUTH!</a>
00:04:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h04m49s">No, wait. If Jasmine finds out I'm really some crummy street rat, she'd laugh at me.</a>
00:04:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h04m55s">But Aladdin is wrong. Sure, things appear to go the way that he wants for a little while</a>
00:04:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h04m59s">but his continued line nearly destroys the entire kingdom</a>
00:04:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h05m02s">and ends his relationship with Jasmine and Jordan makes this point.</a>
00:05:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h05m06s">It's that if your relationships have a conflict, that's often just the surface-level issue.</a>
00:05:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h05m10s">The deeper problem is that you're not being honest about how you feel</a>
00:05:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h05m14s">and what you need; you're not being honest about who you are.</a>
00:05:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h05m18s">Instead, like Aladdin, you're only doing and saying the
things that you think will make the other person like you.</a>
00:05:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h05m24s">It's the principle when your relationships are working whether they're with yourself</a>
00:05:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h05m29s">or with one or many people — if they're working, they're

could fall into when you start telling the truth.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h05m58s">First off, you can be an ideologue and that is someone who doesn't test ideas</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2W-5J1vl8o#t=00h06m03s">against reality and who doesn't adjust their ideas based on reality.</a>
