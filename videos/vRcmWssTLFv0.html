<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h02m06s">But it doesn't really matter at the moment
because so far so good, roughly speaking.</a>
00:02:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h02m14s">Now, people think the world is an objective
place because we can describe it objectively,</a>
00:02:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h02m19s">and that's a much more debatable presupposition.</a>
00:02:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h02m25s">It’s partly debatable because it's actually
based on a decision in some sense, rather</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h02m31s">than evidence, partly because your knowledge
is finite in every direction in some sense.</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h02m38s">So what that means in a way is no matter what
you know about anything, you don't know everything</a>
00:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h02m43s">about that thing.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h02m44s">And so, you kind of ground out in ignorance
at some point.</a>
00:02:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h02m47s">So what means is you that you have to buttress
your thinking with a set of assumptions that</a>
00:02:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h02m51s">you don't question or you just end up in an
infinite regress.</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h02m55s">One of those sets of assumptions is usually
reality definition sets of assumptions, or</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h03m02s">truth definition sets of assumptions, but
the thing is generally no matter what your</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h03m07s">theory of reality is, or what your theory
of truth is, there are alternative theories</a>
00:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h03m12s">of reality and alternative theories of truth
that are equally rigorous and that have different</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h03m19s">And it’s a very tricky business, so for
example, if you're a reductionist materialist,</a>
00:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h03m30s">you're going to make the presupposition that
brain physiology is more real than emotional</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h03m39s">experience.</a>
00:03:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h03m40s">I suppose that's in some sense because you
can't get access to someone else’s emotional</a>
00:03:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h03m45s">experiences, at least not directly whereas
you can get universal access to the fundamental</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h03m51s">It’s something like that.</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h03m53s">Anyways now, that's still an arbitrary assumption
because the person and you as well are going</a>
00:03:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h04m00s">to be acting all the time as if your emotions
and motivational states are real and so then</a>
00:04:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h04m04s">you run into a problem and the problem is
well, how do you know what someone actually</a>
00:04:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h04m09s">believes?</a>
00:04:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h04m10s">You listen to what they say or do you listen
to their explicit and well articulated theories,</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h04m16s">or do you watch how they act?</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h04m18s">And the answer to that is, you make your choice
and generally there are reasons for that.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h04m26s">Now, one of the conceptual tools that I have
found helpful in my attempts to avoid confusion</a>
00:04:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h04m35s">when dealing with the fact that there are
very many ways of looking at the world is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h04m39s">to start thinking about theories of reality
as tools rather than descriptions and I find</a>

I think it’s also an element of pragmatic</a>

about the scientific endeavor, and this is</a>

a stupid answer because - I think it’s a</a>

to do it, which is pretty impressive.</a>
00:09:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h09m56s">And you could kind of see why octopi can kind

appendages which allow them to manipulate</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h10m05s">So, one of the precursors to being able to
be intelligent in any act of way is that you</a>
00:10:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h10m11s">have to have tentacle-y appendages so you
can manipulate the world.</a>
00:10:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h10m16s">At least for it to be anything resembling
what we would consider to be intelligence,</a>
00:10:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h10m19s">and that's part of the reason dolphins aren't
really as intelligent as people like to think</a>
00:10:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h10m23s">because what are they gonna do?</a>
00:10:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h10m25s">They can't build cities with their flippers.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h10m27s">They're kinda trapped in their test tube bodies,
and the same thing applies to whales.</a>
00:10:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h10m33s">Obviously they have very large brains, and
they're very social, and they can learn, but</a>
00:10:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h10m37s">whatever their intelligence is, it’s not
like our intelligence because we run around</a>
00:10:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h10m41s">tearing things apart and putting them back
together and we’ve got the body for that.</a>
00:10:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h10m46s">So anyways, long before we were practicing
science, we were doing perfectly well, in</a>
00:10:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h10m51s">a sense, without any real knowledge of the
objective world at all - at least not any</a>
00:10:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h10m56s">scientific knowledge about the objective world.</a>
00:10:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h10m58s">So another thing you might observe about that
is that you can survive perfectly well without</a>
00:10:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h11m03s">knowing any science at all, in an articulated
and developed manner.</a>
00:11:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h11m08s">Of course animals are in that category.</a>
00:11:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h11m11s">So, that also, I think in some sense, undermines
the claim of science to anything approaching</a>
00:11:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h11m17s">a universal truth because obviously life can
get along perfectly well without it.</a>
00:11:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h11m21s">Now it depends on some degree whether you’re
a Darwinian or a Newtonian.</a>
00:11:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h11m24s">Perhaps the unwillingness to commence on what
people should do is one feature of modern</a>

I’m thinking someone like Clifford.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h15m50s">Imagine you're trying to analyze an essay,
and I’ve actually built an essay writing</a>
00:15:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h15m54s">module which is on my site - 230 website.</a>
00:15:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h15m59s">I don’t remember which template it is but
I’ll tell you in a while.</a>
00:15:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h16m03s">It’s based on this theory of meaning, roughly
speaking, and you should use it to write your</a>
00:16:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h16m08s">essay because if you do, it’ll be a way
better essay.</a>
00:16:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h16m11s">Here’s the issue.</a>
00:16:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h16m12s">If you're reading an essay, where is the meaning?</a>
00:16:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h16m16s">Well, that’s a hard one because it might
be a hard one.</a>
00:16:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h16m22s">So, the question might be badly formulated
in some sense because it might be many places.</a>
00:16:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h16m26s">But, let’s think it through logically.</a>
00:16:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h16m28s">Well you need the letters if it’s written
in alphabetic script.</a>
00:16:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h16m32s">So obviously some of the meaning is in the
letters, and then the letters are combined</a>
00:16:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h16m36s">in certain particular ways and that gives
you some words, and the words are combined</a>
00:16:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h16m40s">in some particular ways and that gives you
phrases, and the phrases are joined together</a>
00:16:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h16m44s">in sentences, and the sentences are strung
together in some reasonably coherent manner.</a>
00:16:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h16m49s">So they kind of go from start to end in a
paragraph, and then the paragraphs are strung</a>
00:16:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h16m53s">together in a coherent manner to make up the
totality of the essay.</a>
00:16:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h16m58s">One of the things I noticed when I tried to
figure out how to grade essays and how to</a>
00:16:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h17m02s">assess them is that you could do a good or
a bad job at any one of those levels.</a>
00:17:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h17m07s">Like a really bad essay is full of spelling
mistakes, the words are inappropriate because</a>
00:17:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h17m14s">the person doesn't actually understand them
so they're awkwardly used, the phrases are</a>
00:17:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h17m17s">put together in a cliched manner, the sentence
structure isn't good.</a>
00:17:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h17m22s">The sentences aren't even in the right paragraphs,
much less organized properly.</a>
00:17:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h17m27s">The paragraphs don't flow from one to another
in what might be called - that’s kind of</a>
00:17:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h17m32s">where the skeleton of the story is.</a>
00:17:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h17m34s">It’s sort of the most important level in
some sense, and even if that wasn't all wrong</a>
00:17:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h17m39s">there’s actually no idea there anyways.</a>
00:17:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h17m42s">And then you can also read essays that have
one or more of those flaws or some combination</a>
00:17:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h17m50s">of all of them.</a>
00:17:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h17m51s">So very frequently, I’d read a student’s
essays and this often happens with smart,</a>
00:17:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h17m56s">creative students who are very badly educated,
and that would be probably fifty percent of</a>
00:17:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h18m04s">the people in this class, I would bet.</a>
00:18:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h18m06s">I say that for genuine reasons because I run
a fourth year seminar where I have people</a>
00:18:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h18m11s">write extensively, so what they do is they
write a four page essay, and then I complain</a>
00:18:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h18m17s">about it at all those levels of analysis,
and then they write the same essay again in</a>
00:18:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h18m21s">six pages, and then I do the same thing, and
then I do the same thing and then they do</a>
00:18:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h18m23s">the same thing in eight pages, and half of
the first essays are terrible.</a>
00:18:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h18m29s">That's partly because students do triage.</a>
00:18:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h18m31s">They think, well do I really have to work
in this course?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h18m34s">I’ll try a bit and if I get slapped, I’ll
work a little harder, and if I don’t, I’ll</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h18m39s">devote my time to other courses which is a
perfectly reasonable thing to do, but some</a>
00:18:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h18m43s">of it is just pure inability.</a>
00:18:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h18m44s">But what is really fascinating is by the end
of the course is that all of the students</a>
00:18:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h18m48s">are writing well, and it’s pathetic as far
as I’m concerned because it meant that everybody</a>
00:18:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h18m53s">could have been taught to write ten years
ago but they weren't.</a>
00:18:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h18m57s">Anyways if you look at this template that
I laid out, then it will help you in this</a>
00:18:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h19m02s">because it walks you through the process of
writing properly.</a>
00:19:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h19m11s">So now and then I would read an essay and
everything is wrong about it, but there's</a>
00:19:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h19m14s">a really smart about it, and knowing this
multilevel idea with regards to meaning, I</a>
00:19:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h19m19s">can say, look you’re smarter than you can
write.</a>
00:19:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h19m23s">There's really something here, but here's
all the things that are wrong with it.</a>
00:19:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h19m27s">Then you get a worse situation in some sense
where everything about the essay is good but</a>
00:19:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h19m31s">the idea isn’t, and so the words are good,
the phrases.</a>
00:19:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h19m34s">The sentences are right, and it goes together
but it adds up to nothing.</a>
00:19:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h19m38s">And those are hard to grade because you give
them a C maybe or a B, cause I’d probably</a>
00:19:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h19m42s">give them a B, and the person comes up and
says, where did I make a mistake?</a>
00:19:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h19m46s">It’s like, well you didn't really make a
mistake, you just didn't do anything right,</a>
00:19:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h19m52s">and that's a whole different problem.</a>
00:19:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h19m55s">So you think, that’s pretty complex with
regards to an essay.</a>
00:19:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h19m57s">Where’s the meaning?</a>
00:19:57</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h20m04s">I was thinking of this the other day.</a>

of my students have changed quite radically</a>
00:20:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h20m09s">over the years.</a>

it for granted that everyone in the room would</a>

would know the Judeo-Christian version of</a>

00:20:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h20m25s">Well that's gone, and that's really made it
difficult for me in some ways because there's</a>
00:20:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h20m31s">a bunch of things.</a>
00:20:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h20m32s">There’s a bunch of collective knowledge
that might constitute a shared set of cultural</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h20m37s">assumptions that I can no longer presume and
it means there's all sorts of things that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h20m41s">I can't talk about or if I’m going to talk

00:20:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h20m50s">So that’s also made me think because if
I - let’s say you write me an essay and</a>
00:20:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h20m55s">let’s say it’s a Psychology essay.</a>
00:20:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h20m56s">Now you're gonna presume that there's a whole
bunch of things I know about Psychology that</a>
00:20:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h21m00s">you also know.</a>
00:21:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h21m01s">And the reason you're going to presume that
is because, well we come - for the purpose</a>
00:21:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h21m05s">of this conversation - we come from the same
cultural background and what that means is</a>
00:21:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h21m11s">we share a set of assumptions, and we don't
have to say what those assumptions are.</a>
00:21:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h21m17s">We can assume them and then we can talk about
the things that we disagree about, and of</a>
00:21:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h21m21s">course that's what you're doing when you're
writing an essay or having a conversation</a>
00:21:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h21m24s">right?</a>
00:21:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h21m25s">You're saying well obviously we don't have
to talk about what we know because we already</a>
00:21:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h21m29s">know it.</a>
00:21:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h21m30s">We want to push that a little bit so we start
to talk a little bit about the things we don’t</a>
00:21:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h21m34s">know, but no more so than we both understand.</a>
00:21:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h21m40s">So then you think damn it, the meaning of
the essay isn’t in the essay at all.</a>
00:21:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h21m44s">It’s in the interaction between the shared
cultural assumptions between the writer and</a>
00:21:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h21m48s">the reader and the essay.</a>
00:21:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h21m50s">Well and then you think, it’s worse than
that even because the shared cultural assumptions</a>
00:21:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h21m54s">are in their own sort of network, and then
that's nested inside a very an extraordinarily</a>
00:21:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h22m02s">broad biological network and it’s like actually,
you can continue expanding the outer reaches</a>
00:22:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h22m09s">of the essay without limit.</a>
00:22:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h22m13s">So part of that means it’s actually impossible
to specify the meaning of the essay.</a>
00:22:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h22m18s">It’s something you both work at in combination,
as writer and as reader, but it’s very fluid</a>
00:22:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h22m25s">and flexible.</a>
00:22:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h22m26s">That problem is partly why the post modernists
got going because they sort of noticed this.</a>
00:22:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h22m31s">Corrupt as they are, they did notice at one
point that it was very very difficult to say</a>
00:22:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h22m37s">what any given phrase, paragraph, or essay
mean because it wasn't there - like it’s</a>
00:22:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h22m45s">not in the book.</a>
00:22:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h22m46s">It’s sort of in the book, but - you know
this too if you listen to a piece of music.</a>
00:22:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h22m53s">So let’s say you had a favorite song when
you were fourteen, and when you first heard</a>
00:22:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h22m58s">that song, maybe you didn’t like it that
much, but you maybe heard it four times and</a>
00:22:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h23m02s">thought man that’s one excellent song.</a>
00:23:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h23m04s">Then at some point, you've heard it so many
times that you never want to hear it again.</a>
00:23:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h23m08s">That’s interesting too because it means
the song has transformed in relationship to</a>
00:23:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h23m12s">your historical interactions with it and you
might say, no this song is the same.</a>
00:23:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h23m19s">Well, it depends on what you mean by the song.</a>
00:23:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h23m22s">The notes are the same.</a>
00:23:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h23m24s">The experience has certainly transformed.</a>
00:23:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h23m27s">So anyways, back to the couple that are sitting
there talking.</a>
00:23:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h23m31s">They're having this argument and they're trying
to sort out what this is about.</a>
00:23:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h23m33s">Well the problem is it’s about everything
the argument is about plus everything that’s</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h23m38s">ever happened to them in their relationship.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h23m42s">If someone has told you the same thing fifty
times, it is not the same thing as the thing</a>
00:23:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h23m48s">they told you the first time.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h23m50s">God only knows how many transformations it’s
gone through as it’s been continually repeated,</a>
00:23:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h23m55s">and how many different arguments it’s been
embedded in, and how many things you’d have</a>
00:23:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h23m59s">to know to understand the shades of intonation
in all of that.</a>
00:23:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h24m03s">But basically each utterance a couple produces
is - it’s meaning is determined by the entire</a>

have had.</a>
00:24:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h24m14s">So, how are you going to specify that?</a>
00:24:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h24m16s">It’s very very difficult to specify it.</a>
00:24:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h24m19s">Now, you really can’t, and it’s also difficult
to know when you’ve specified it enough.</a>
00:24:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h24m25s">You know, one of the things that is interesting
training as a psychoanalyst is that it started</a>

engaged in an argument like that because someone</a>

that are lurking beneath the surface of that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h25m20s">speech act that seemed to be something - you
could capture it on a video.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h25m24s">You can say, well here’s what you said.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h25m26s">There's a video tape recording of it.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h25m28s">It’s like no, that's not what you said because
the videotape cannot capture the context,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h25m32s">and it can’t.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h28m29s">Okay, so here’s a question for you.</a>
00:28:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h28m32s">If you took a bunch of chimpanzees that didn't
know each other and you threw them in this</a>

00:28:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h28m39s">Right.</a>
00:28:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h28m40s">Now, you're roughly in that situation, not
exactly because A - you’re not chimpanzees,</a>
00:28:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h28m45s">but you know your genetic material is quite
reasonably related.</a>
00:28:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h28m52s">You only split off your common ancestors seven

million years ago.</a>
00:28:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h28m59s">It’s still relatively recently from the
evolutionary perspective.</a>
00:28:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h29m03s">Here you all are, you don’t really know

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h29m06s">You obviously share important elements of
identity.</a>
00:29:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h29m09s">So you’re all students, and you can come
in here and all of a sudden you all know what</a>
00:29:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h29m13s">to do, and no one fights.</a>
00:29:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h29m15s">Or if they do fight, it’s - there are very
constrained rules around the fighting and</a>
00:29:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h29m19s">everyone accepts them, and it seems hard to
say that’s not better than the alternative.</a>
00:29:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h29m25s">So unless you wanna come in here and have
an absolute chaotic war.</a>
00:29:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h29m33s">Somehow we’ve managed to figure out how
we can figure out how to bring relative strangers</a>
00:29:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h29m38s">together in a relatively high pressure situation
because we’re learning about complicated</a>
00:29:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h29m42s">and challenging things, and everybody gets
along.</a>
00:29:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h29m47s">And everybody’s kind of happy about that.</a>
00:29:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h29m48s">So it looks like we can figure out patterns
of behavior that, well, then the question</a>
00:29:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h29m54s">is, are they correct?</a>
00:29:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h29m55s">Are they morally correct?</a>
00:29:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h29m57s">Are they right, or did they work?</a>
00:29:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h29m59s">And you might also ask yourself what’s the
difference between all of those claims, is</a>
00:29:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h30m03s">there similarity or difference between those

00:30:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h30m06s">So, and then you might ask yourself - okay
so here’s something else you might think</a>
00:30:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h30m10s">about.</a>
00:30:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h30m12s">So, let’s say you’re playing Monopoly.</a>
00:30:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h30m17s">How many of you have played Monopoly in your
life?</a>
00:30:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h30m20s">Okay, is there anyone here who hasn't played
Monopoly?</a>
00:30:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h30m22s">Excellent.</a>
00:30:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h30m23s">A cultural universal.</a>
00:30:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h30m27s">So, obviously in some ways it doesn't matter
if you get all those little hotels right?</a>
00:30:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h30m36s">But, on the other hand if you act like it
doesn't matter while you're playing Monopoly,</a>
00:30:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h30m42s">then people hit you with things and they should
because part of the rule is that you're gonna</a>
00:30:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h30m45s">act like this matters because if you don't,
then it’s not any fun.</a>
00:30:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h30m49s">So you have to act like it matters and then
it turns out when you start playing, it matters.</a>
00:30:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h30m54s">People will actually - they’ll get angry,
especially if you cheat.</a>
00:30:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h30m58s">But people will play Monopoly.</a>
00:30:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h30m59s">They’ll act as if the endpoint matters.</a>
00:30:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h31m02s">You might say, well what is the endpoint?</a>
00:31:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h31m04s">And one answer is to get all the hotels and
all the money, so you enter the 1%, so you</a>
00:31:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h31m11s">have all the wealth and no one has any, and
so you win and you feel happy about that,</a>
00:31:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h31m15s">even if you're a radical left winger.</a>
00:31:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h31m19s">So that's kind of interesting.</a>
00:31:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h31m22s">Then you say, well that's not really the point.</a>
00:31:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h31m23s">The point is to enjoy the game, and you say
yeah okay that’s probably the point too.</a>
00:31:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h31m29s">And you might say, well that's not really
the point either.</a>
00:31:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h31m31s">You want to hone your negotiating skills.</a>
00:31:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h31m35s">You want to spend some time with your friends.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h31m38s">There's lots of things going on at once, but
it doesn't really matter because Monopoly</a>
00:31:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h31m42s">is a game that you’ll play.</a>
00:31:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h31m44s">Now imagine instead that Monopoly - here's
the new rule for Monopoly.</a>
00:31:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h31m52s">All the people you're playing with can randomly
steal your hotels and houses and your money</a>
00:31:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h31m58s">whenever they want, and you can steal it back.</a>
00:31:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h32m02s">So then you think, well no one’s gonna play
that game, and then you think well why not?</a>
00:32:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h32m11s">Well, the first surface answer is that’s
a stupid game, and you know that somehow.</a>
00:32:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h32m17s">You think that’s a stupid game, but then
you start to think about well why is that</a>
00:32:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h32m21s">a stupid game?</a>
00:32:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h32m22s">Or you might say it’s an unplayable game
which would be a little bit more sophisticated.</a>
00:32:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h32m27s">Why would that not work?</a>
00:32:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h32m29s">And you might say, well what’s the point
in getting all the hotels if someone could</a>
00:32:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h32m33s">just take them?</a>
00:32:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h32m34s">But you might say what’s the point in getting
the hotels anyway?</a>
00:32:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h32m37s">Like who cares about the damn hotels.</a>
00:32:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h32m38s">So it’s a bit tricky.</a>
00:32:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h32m40s">There’s something about the randomness of
what’s now allowed and the unpredictability</a>
00:32:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h32m45s">of it and the arbitrary nature of it and its
lack of a relationship with your own actions</a>
00:32:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h32m50s">that takes all the motivational impetus out
of the game.</a>
00:32:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h32m53s">So one thing we might think about to begin
with, is there’s a difference between a</a>
00:32:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h32m59s">good game and a bad game, and there's also
a difference between a game and no game.</a>
00:32:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h33m05s">And we don’t know what the difference is

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h33m33s">It’s more complex and the part where you
said - I mean it’s not necessarily stealing</a>
00:33:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h33m45s">but there’s a piece of the game in there,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h33m57s">It’s more akin to real like I think, like

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h34m26s">Well, Settlers of Catan is a bit like Risk
because it has a strategic element and there's</a>
00:34:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h34m31s">a territorial expansion that goes along with

00:34:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h34m38s">Okay but well, you can see - you have intuitions
about what constitutes a better game and part</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h34m43s">of the way you develop those intuitions is
not exactly philosophical because I doubt</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h34m48s">if you really thought through why Settlers
of Catan is a better game than, say, Risk</a>
00:34:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h34m52s">or Monopoly for those of that think it does,
but you watch your own reaction and your own</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h34m58s">reaction is okay well I’d rather play Settlers
of Catan.</a>
00:34:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h35m02s">You might ask yourself why, but you don’t
have to.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h35m05s">You’d just rather play it.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h35m08s">So then you think well what does it mean that
you’d rather play it?</a>
00:35:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h35m11s">Well it’s more fun, it’s more enjoyable.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h35m14s">If asked voluntarily, that's the one I would

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h35m18s">from those reasons but obviously those are
complex - that’s a complex social engagement,</a>
00:35:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h35m25s">those games.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h35m27s">In fact they’re so complex, you can have
preferences and not even know why, and that’s</a>
00:35:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h35m34s">interesting.</a>
00:35:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h35m35s">I think the idea that there are games, good
games and bad games and games and non-games,</a>
00:35:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h35m41s">is a nice way of starting to conceptualize
what the difference might be between moral</a>
00:35:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h35m46s">systems because a game is actually a moral
system.</a>
00:35:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h35m49s">It has a point.</a>
00:35:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h35m51s">It has an end.</a>
00:35:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h35m52s">You have to cooperate and compete to run through
the game.</a>
00:35:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h35m58s">So awhile back, a psychologist actually started
this and it’s reprehensible, but psychologists</a>
00:35:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h36m07s">have done lots of reprehensible things and
this is one of them.</a>
00:36:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h36m11s">This psychologist, whose name I don't remember
at the moment, was reviewing the literature</a>
00:36:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h36m14s">on the difference in aggression between boys
and girls and men and women.</a>
00:36:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h36m20s">Boys and men are much more aggressive, depending
on how you define as aggressive, than girls</a>
00:36:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h36m25s">and women.</a>
00:36:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h36m26s">Now that tends to be mostly true with physical
aggression.</a>
00:36:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h36m31s">So you might say kicking, hitting, biting,
punching, stealing.</a>
00:36:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h36m35s">Two year old boys for example - two year olds,
the ones who do most of that are boys.</a>
00:36:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h36m40s">Now, the two year old girls are cutting each
other up behind their backs but no one measures</a>
00:36:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h36m44s">that.</a>
00:36:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h36m45s">So you find for example, with female aggression
it tends to be relationship savaging, and</a>
00:36:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h36m50s">you see that in the playground.</a>
00:36:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h36m52s">You see it in junior high.</a>
00:36:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h36m53s">You see it in high school, and you see it
on the net.</a>
00:36:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h36m55s">It’s always the same thing.</a>
00:36:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h36m57s">Whether men are more aggressive than women,
it depends on how you define aggression, but</a>
00:36:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h37m01s">men are more physically aggressive anyways.</a>
00:37:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h37m04s">Awhile back, there was this idea that maybe
we could dampen down the male aggression by</a>
00:37:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h37m12s">socializing little boys more like little girls,
and one of the offshoots of that was that</a>
00:37:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h37m18s">we should only let children play cooperative
games.</a>
00:37:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h37m22s">Now, the first thing you might notice is that
anything you might have done as a game was</a>
00:37:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h37m26s">not cooperative.</a>
00:37:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h37m28s">Right, like it’s not a game if it’s just
cooperative, but then the other thing you</a>
00:37:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h37m33s">might notice is that the distinction between
a cooperative and a competitive game is far</a>
00:37:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h37m38s">more sophisticated than people that come up
with those dimwitted theories of how to improve</a>
00:37:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h37m42s">the world would ever appreciate.</a>
00:37:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h37m44s">So here’s an example.</a>
00:37:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h37m47s">Is hockey a game?</a>

00:37:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h37m57s">Why?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h37m58s">Why is it a cooperative game?</a>
00:37:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h37m59s">Because you have to work together.</a>
00:37:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h38m01s">Right, so there's the team right.</a>
00:38:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h38m03s">You’re also obviously cooperating with your
team members, but you're also maybe trying</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h38m07s">to be the best player, but you're also trying

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h38m11s">irritate the hell out of your team players
right, because there's something about that</a>
00:38:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h38m16s">that’s counter productive.</a>
00:38:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h38m17s">Like, even if you're a good player and you’re

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h38m23s">maybe you're not interested in the development

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h38m30s">So, there’s obviously a cooperative element.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h38m32s">Is there a cooperative element beyond that?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h38m34s">Well yeah, you have to all agree to sort of
cooperate in so much as agreeing to the rules</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h38m39s">of the game and playing it.</a>

you're all there to play hockey.</a>
00:38:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h38m51s">So just to play hockey is a cooperative endeavor
because think of all the other things you</a>
00:38:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h38m55s">could be doing instead of playing hockey at
that time.</a>
00:38:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h38m58s">You could be doing an infinite number of other
things so really if you look at the relationship</a>
00:38:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h39m01s">between cooperation and competition in any
collaborative human affair, things are usually</a>
00:39:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h39m08s">competitive at one level, cooperative at another,
competitive at another, like there’s this</a>
00:39:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h39m12s">continual interplay between competition and
cooperation and you can't disentangle them.</a>
00:39:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h39m17s">Now one of the things that Piaget said - Piaget
is a, for those of you who don’t know and</a>
00:39:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h39m22s">you probably all do know, is perhaps the foremost
developmental psychologist of the 20th century</a>
00:39:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h39m26s">even though he didn't think he was a psychologist.</a>
00:39:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h39m29s">Piaget actually made the claim, the radical
claim, that two year olds for example - this</a>
00:39:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h39m34s">isn’t Piaget’s claim but it’s associated.</a>
00:39:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h39m38s">If you put people together, and their age
matched.</a>
00:39:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h39m41s">So you got a group of nine months olds, say,
one year olds, two year olds, three year olds,</a>
00:39:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h39m46s">all the way up to eighteen, and you just throw
them in a room, maybe with some things of</a>
00:39:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h39m50s">them to do and you count the number of violent
acts, which is kicking, hitting, biting, or</a>
00:39:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h39m56s">stealing.</a>
00:39:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h39m57s">Okay, two year olds, they’re the most violent
human beings and most of them aren't actually</a>
00:39:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h40m03s">violent.</a>
00:40:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h40m05s">There's a subset of them that are </a>
00:40:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h40m06s">It’s about five to ten percent of them,
and almost all of them are boys, and then</a>
00:40:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h40m10s">if you track those boys across time, over
the next two years most of them become civilized</a>
00:40:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h40m16s">and the ones that don't never become civilized.</a>
00:40:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h40m20s">So they're kind of antisocial throughout their
childhood, and then when testosterone kicks</a>
00:40:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h40m24s">in at about fourteen and all the boys get
antisocial again, they catch up to the always</a>
00:40:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h40m29s">antisocial boys and the normal boys taper
off quite dramatically at around nineteen</a>
00:40:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h40m34s">and flatten right out at about twenty seven
but the antisocial boys, they just keep being</a>
00:40:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h40m38s">antisocial.</a>
00:40:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h40m39s">So now, Piaget noted that there was a dramatic
transformation in behavior - individual behavior</a>
00:40:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h40m51s">- in relationship to the social world between
the ages of two and four.</a>
00:40:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h40m56s">And, if you watch two year olds play together,
what they did fundamentally is like a parallel</a>
00:40:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h41m01s">play.</a>
00:41:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h41m02s">So maybe, there's one two year old there and
another two year old there and that two year</a>
00:41:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h41m07s">old is playing truck and this two year old
is playing ambulance or something or maybe</a>
00:41:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h41m11s">playing doll, and they're sitting with each
other, and maybe they interact a little bit</a>
00:41:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h41m15s">but they're not playing the same game.</a>
00:41:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h41m18s">Okay so, what they're doing in some sense
is they're engaged in a goal directed activity,</a>
00:41:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h41m25s">and it has a point.</a>
00:41:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h41m28s">They're sort of integrating all their interior
sub personalities in a sense that allows them</a>
00:41:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h41m34s">to play a single game with themselves.</a>
00:41:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h41m38s">That's pretty complex from a cognitive perspective
because they're not fractionated, and they're</a>
00:41:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h41m44s">not being pulled out by hunger or anger or
sadness or fear or any of those things, and</a>
00:41:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h41m50s">they're doing something that's highly complex
cognitively and they can organize themselves</a>
00:41:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h41m55s">well enough to do it for a substantial period
of time.</a>
00:41:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h41m58s">So it’s like it’s a major developmental
advance.</a>
00:41:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h41m59s">But they can't do it with another person.</a>
00:41:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h42m02s">Now one of Piaget’s hypotheses was that
they couldn't do it - they couldn't play the</a>
00:42:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h42m09s">same game with another person without actually
setting up a competitive structure so actually</a>
00:42:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h42m16s">competition was a prerequisite to competition.</a>
00:42:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h42m19s">The idea was okay so, if you watch how kids
do this, you can get a sense of it.</a>
00:42:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h42m25s">I mean, on the one hand they all get together
and they decide how to play tag.</a>
00:42:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h42m30s">Everyone knows the rules for tag, and you
can win at tag, but without the point - the</a>
00:42:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h42m35s">point in some sense is the construction of
a dominance hierarchy of competence.</a>
00:42:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h42m40s">Someone wins and then there are sort of the
people who are second best and third best,</a>
00:42:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h42m43s">and everybody's really into doing that.</a>
00:42:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h42m45s">You all have to get together if you're kids
and you say well what should we do.</a>
00:42:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h42m47s">You decide, well, we’re gonna play tag and
then you set up the rules because there’s</a>
00:42:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h42m51s">infinite variations of tag, and everyone goes
off and play.</a>
00:42:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h42m55s">So it’s a competitive game because only
one person can win, or maybe one at a time</a>
00:42:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h42m59s">can win.</a>
00:42:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h43m00s">But once you’ve all agreed on that, then
you’re cooperating.</a>
00:43:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h43m04s">So that’s quite interesting, and Piaget
regarded that as a necessary stage of the</a>
00:43:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h43m09s">ability to act like a social creature.</a>
00:43:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h43m12s">Here’s something that happens if you’re
not a very popular kid.</a>
00:43:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h43m16s">Let’s say four kids are playing Jacks.</a>
00:43:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h43m20s">Good enough.</a>
00:43:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h43m21s">I don't think kids play Jacks anymore but
whatever.</a>
00:43:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h43m24s">If they were playing Jacks, they’re sittings
there playing Jacks, and when you play Jacks,</a>
00:43:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h43m28s">you bounce a ball and you pick up a jack,
and if you manage that and a ball - if you</a>
00:43:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h43m32s">manage that, you drop the ball and pick up
two jacks and drop the ball, and you keep</a>
00:43:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h43m35s">going up till like eight jacks or whatever.</a>
00:43:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h43m38s">So now another kid wants to play Jacks, and
we’ll say this is a relatively popular kid</a>
00:43:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h43m43s">and so the kid sidles up to the group that’s
playing and sits down because they're all</a>
00:43:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h43m47s">sitting down and then watches, and then maybe
watches jack-playing motions or a couple of</a>
00:43:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h43m53s">comments about how the Jacks game is going,
and maybe the other kids don't have to disrupt</a>
00:43:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h43m58s">what they're doing very much and they can
kind of open the circle, and let that kid</a>
00:43:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h44m02s">scoot in and he gets to, or she gets to play
Jacks too.</a>
00:44:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h44m05s">Whereas a kid that doesn't - and that often
doesn't happen, even if it’s a popular kid.</a>
00:44:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h44m09s">Sometimes the little group that's already
formed won’t open and let them in.</a>
00:44:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h44m12s">You've been to cocktail parties.</a>

00:44:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h44m17s">So you’re supposed to hang around the edge
of the conversation and maybe if you've got</a>
00:44:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h44m21s">something that isn't too stupid to say, you

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h44m26s">Okay, now if you're maybe not very social,
what you do is stand out there and you don't</a>
00:44:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h44m31s">notice what the hell is going on and you don't

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h44m39s">Let's go do something else, in which case
the kids are not happy with you, and you're</a>

00:48:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h48m47s">And so a lot of children’s tradition is

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h49m23s">They’re exploring the landscape, and they're

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h49m35s">So anyways, children pass these games down
across the centuries.</a>
00:49:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h49m41s">Maybe tag is one of those games you don't
even have to pass down.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h49m45s">Children might just invent it spontaneously
with every generation because you can more</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h49m58s">Okay, so there are some games that are enjoyable
enough that they're either transmitted and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h50m13s">So that’s interesting too because what it
means is that there’s certain types of competitive</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h50m51s">You go like this.</a>
00:50:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h50m53s">Okay then what’s the next rule?</a>
00:50:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h50m55s">That’s right.</a>
00:50:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h50m57s">You reveal your eyes.</a>
00:50:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h50m58s">You don't just sit there like this.</a>
00:50:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h51m00s">Now you can play a trick on a baby if you
want, and babies will laugh about this sort</a>
00:51:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h51m05s">of thing which is really, I think, quite amazing.</a>
00:51:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h51m07s">A baby’s laugh is something remarkable to
me.</a>
00:51:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h51m10s">So you can go like this, and then like this
and then like this and then like this and</a>
00:51:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h51m15s">then you can do this, and the baby will laugh
because that's a little variation eh.</a>
00:51:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h51m20s">Or you can go like this.</a>
00:51:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h51m24s">Right.</a>
00:51:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h51m25s">And then the baby - well that’ll even make
you guys laugh.</a>
00:51:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h51m28s">That’s good, you can see how deeply rooted
this is.</a>
00:51:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h51m32s">So you know but, eventually what’ll the
baby do?</a>
00:51:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h51m34s">It’ll grab your hands, pull them down because
you're breaking the damn rules.</a>
00:51:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h51m38s">And the baby knows the rules even though you’ve
never established any rules, and you can get</a>
00:51:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h51m43s">the rules going with about five reps.</a>
00:51:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h51m45s">You say okay, this.</a>
00:51:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h51m46s">Maybe no one’s ever played peek-a-boo with
a baby.</a>
00:51:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h51m49s">The baby figures it out right away.</a>
00:51:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h51m50s">This, this, and then you vary that.</a>
00:51:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h51m53s">Maybe do that.</a>
00:51:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h51m54s">That baby thinks that’s a hell of a good
joke, you know, cause you went up instead</a>
00:51:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h51m58s">of down, and so it’s variations within this
rule bound theme.</a>
00:51:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h52m02s">It’s kind of musical in a sense, there’s
variations in the theme.</a>
00:52:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h52m05s">Now what you don’t do is go.</a>
00:52:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h52m07s">Waahh!</a>
00:52:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h52m08s">Cause that’ll just short it right out.</a>
00:52:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h52m13s">So you don't do that unless you’re, you
know, unless you have an evil streak in you.</a>
00:52:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h52m20s">So there's certainly ways of violating the
baby’s expectations and what the baby will</a>
00:52:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h52m24s">do if you do that is startle and they startle
with their whole bodies, and then look at</a>
00:52:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h52m28s">you and probably they’ll burst into tears.</a>
00:52:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h52m31s">But some babies will just laugh like mad if
something like that happens, and you can find</a>
00:52:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h52m35s">those babies all over YouTube, right, because
you get the baby that the mother sneezes and</a>
00:52:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h52m40s">the baby has a fit laughing for like ten minutes.</a>
00:52:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h52m43s">But it’s quite interesting.</a>
00:52:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h52m45s">One of the things about babies that I’ve
never been able to understand is the staggering</a>
00:52:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h52m48s">sophistication of their senses of humor.</a>
00:52:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h52m51s">Like it’s deep eh?</a>
00:52:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h52m53s">Cause even a nine month old baby can play
tricks on you.</a>
00:52:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h52m55s">So, you know they're baby tricks, but still,
they’re tricks and they laugh and they're</a>
00:52:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h53m00s">quite comical and they like variation.</a>
00:53:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h53m02s">Anyways, the point is - one of the points
of all this is this understanding of game</a>
00:53:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h53m09s">like structure is really really really really
really really deep inside of us, and it’s</a>
00:53:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h53m15s">way before articulation.</a>
00:53:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h53m17s">It’s way before we can say the rules.</a>
00:53:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h53m21s">Babies can pick up the damn rules right away
and it’s kind of a dance in some sense,</a>
00:53:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h53m26s">and a dance is also a rule bound structure.</a>
00:53:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h53m29s">If you’re dancing with someone well, there’s
rules, but don't step on their feet but you</a>
00:53:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h53m34s">also set up a set of expectations in the dance
and you violate them in tandem.</a>
00:53:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h53m39s">And if you can do it gracefully, it’s fun.</a>
00:53:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h53m42s">Maybe the person you’re dancing with is
an absolute klutz and so autistic you can’t</a>
00:53:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h53m46s">even get outside of yourself, and might make
a half reasonable partner or if it’s just</a>
00:53:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h53m51s">hopeless.</a>
00:53:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h53m52s">But the dance is the same thing.</a>
00:53:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h53m54s">It’s not negotiated verbally.</a>
00:53:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h53m55s">It’s negotiated bodily, and unless we’re
able to imitate, and imitate insanely well</a>
00:53:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h54m01s">because human beings can imitate like mad,
because we won’t be able to do that.</a>
00:54:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h54m05s">So babies are the same way.</a>
00:54:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h54m07s">You basically start - you don’t actually.</a>
00:54:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h54m10s">Peek-a-boo doesn’t have rules because a
rule is a stated description of a set of expectations.</a>
00:54:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h54m17s">What peek-a-boo has is expectations and repetition,
and you can violate the expectation but that</a>
00:54:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h54m23s">doesn’t mean you’re violating a rule because
an expectation is not a rule until you observe</a>
00:54:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h54m29s">the expectation, you describe what it is and
maybe even write it down.</a>
00:54:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h54m34s">You can play games long before you can follow
rules, and one of the things Piaget observed</a>
00:54:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h54m40s">is if you watched kids play a complicated
game like marbles and they're like six, and</a>
00:54:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h54m46s">you take them out of the game and ask them
what the rules are, they can't tell you or</a>
00:54:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h54m49s">they might get some of them right and a bunch
of them wrong.</a>
00:54:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h54m52s">Maybe if you interviewed every child that
was playing, and you looked at the commonality</a>
00:54:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h54m57s">of the descriptions, you could extract out
the underlying rule structure of the game.</a>
00:54:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h55m01s">But the kids don't know the rules.</a>
00:55:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h55m03s">What they know is how to play with other kids
when they're playing marbles, and a lot of</a>
00:55:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h55m08s">that’s nonverbal hints and eyebrow raises
and no you can’t do that and so forth.</a>
00:55:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h55m13s">It isn't much later until they can tell you
the rules, if ever.</a>
00:55:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h55m16s">So like, you know, you guys can't tell me
the rules for dancing successfully with someone.</a>
00:55:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h55m22s">You can tell me some stupid things you shouldn’t
do, but imagine how complex it is.</a>
00:55:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h55m27s">It’s very difficult to articulate out the
whole structure, but you can sure tell when</a>
00:55:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h55m31s">it’s happening, and you can sure tell when
you’re not doing it or when your partner</a>
00:55:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h55m36s">isn’t.</a>
00:55:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h55m37s">So partly what that also means is you know
how to do things you don't know how to do,</a>
00:55:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h55m41s">and you know how to all sorts of things you
don't know how you know how to do.</a>
00:55:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h55m45s">In fact, most of what you know is like that.</a>
00:55:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h55m48s">That also means we can be playing games that
are extraordinarily sophisticated that we</a>
00:55:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h55m55s">don’t understand, but that doesn't mean
- well we can't describe at least.</a>
00:55:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h55m59s">We don't have an articulated knowledge of
the structure, but we can still play them.</a>
00:55:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h56m04s">Now, I don't know if you know this or not.</a>
00:56:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h56m07s">You might know it.</a>
00:56:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h56m11s">A while back, twenty years ago - about that.</a>
00:56:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h56m16s">Those massive online multiplayer games started
to become popular, and some of them - I think,</a>
00:56:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h56m23s">although I don't know this for sure - some
of them lasted a long time, and maybe some</a>
00:56:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h56m27s">of them still being played, like the early
ones.</a>
00:56:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h56m29s">So they developed entire worlds in there and
you know, there was an economist who became</a>
00:56:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h56m35s">quite famous because of those games.</a>
00:56:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h56m38s">Castronova, I think his name was.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h56m40s">Edward Castronova.</a>
00:56:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h56m41s">I think that’s right, but it’s close.</a>
00:56:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h56m45s">Anyways, he thought hey look man those aren’t
games, those are countries.</a>
00:56:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=00h56m50s">So one of the things he tried to do was calculate

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h03m10s">Well one of the things you suggested was that
some of that can be mitigated by doing it</a>
01:03:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h03m11s">properly, which implies there's an emergent
norm for doing this sort of thing and that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h03m17s">if you're good at complying with the norm,
then you’re not irritating people and maybe</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h03m32s">Well I guess one answer to that is that’s
up to them to determine, like if they don't</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h03m39s">The reason I’m saying that specifically
is that you can imagine that’s how the norm</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h03m42s">develops.</a>

is going to develop that allows text conversation</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h03m50s">and real world conversation to occur at the

01:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h03m56s">That means if you can’t do it in the manner
that everyone wants, it’s going to die out.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h04m01s">Now see, that's another example of how you
can see how moral structures - I think - might</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h04m09s">evolve, is the right way of thinking about
it because I think moral structures evolve.</a>
01:04:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h04m13s">And I think they’re just as real as anything
else that evolves.</a>
01:04:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h04m17s">Now, evolved things can be staggeringly complex.</a>
01:04:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h04m20s">Just think about how many lifeforms there
are, and how many niches there are for their</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h04m25s">lifeforms and so you have in some sense an
infinite variety, but it’s not infinite,</a>
01:04:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h04m30s">and it follows patterns.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h04m36s">Here’s an example, and I found this out
awhile back.</a>
01:04:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h04m42s">I did a lot of neurobiological research.</a>
01:04:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h04m48s">Some of it hands on, a lot of it conceptual
especially in the early days of my graduate</a>
01:04:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h04m55s">work.</a>
01:04:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h04m56s">I got really interested in the function of
serotonin.</a>
01:04:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h04m58s">You all know, undoubtedly, that one of the
things antidepressants do is decrease the</a>
01:04:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h05m03s">rate at which serotonin is pulled back up
into the neurons that deliver it and that</a>
01:05:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h05m06s">seems to help stabilize people’s negative
emotions.</a>
01:05:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h05m09s">Makes them less volatile, less anxious, less
likely to withdraw, and so - or you could</a>
01:05:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h05m14s">say it makes them more confident.</a>
01:05:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h05m17s">Now we also know if you say we look at a chimp
hierarchy, you take bottom chimp and you give</a>
01:05:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h05m24s">him anti-depressants, he looks a lot more
like top chimp.</a>
01:05:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h05m28s">So, because the bottom chimp world is a very
dangerous place.</a>
01:05:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h05m32s">It’s very uncertain.</a>
01:05:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h05m33s">He doesn't have a place to sleep.</a>
01:05:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h05m34s">He doesn't have high quality mates.</a>
01:05:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h05m36s">He doesn't have good things to eat.</a>
01:05:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h05m38s">He’s stressed man, it’s bad down there.</a>
01:05:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h05m40s">So maybe that's part of the reason his nervous
system is tuned so that he’s more anxious</a>
01:05:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h05m44s">and upset by everything because everything
is more dangerous.</a>
01:05:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h05m47s">Part of that’s modulated by serotonin.</a>
01:05:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h05m49s">Okay, so here’s a rough rule.</a>
01:05:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h05m51s">If there’s a hierarchy in an animal kingdom,
as you move up the hierarchy, your serotonin</a>
01:05:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h05m59s">levels increase and as you move down the hierarchy,
your serotonin levels decrease and that’s</a>
01:05:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h06m04s">somewhat independent of your absolute wealth.</a>
01:06:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h06m08s">So here’s a famous experiment.</a>
01:06:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h06m09s">It’s called the White Hall experiment and
it was done on English bureaucrats, and the</a>
01:06:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h06m13s">thing that’s so cool about the White Hall
experiments is they were done fifty years</a>
01:06:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h06m17s">apart.</a>
01:06:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h06m18s">So what they showed basically was - imagine
you take an English bureaucracy and you stratify</a>
01:06:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h06m23s">it by position.</a>
01:06:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h06m24s">Englishmen are hierarchical, and so you stratify</a>
01:06:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h06m29s">You have the top people and the bottom people
and what you find is the bottom people die</a>
01:06:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h06m35s">faster and more often.</a>
01:06:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h06m37s">You might say if you're not that healthy,
you end up at the bottom.</a>
01:06:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h06m41s">Fair enough, but there seems to be an effect
above the effect of just general health.</a>
01:06:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h06m46s">It’s worse to be at the bottom than at the
top.</a>
01:06:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h06m49s">Okay, that was true 70 years ago, and another
study was done 50 years after that.</a>
01:06:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h06m55s">Now the thing that’s so cool is by that
time, from a material perspective, the people</a>
01:06:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h07m01s">at the bottom of the modern hierarchy were
at least as wealthy as the people who were</a>
01:07:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h07m06s">like two thirds of the way up 50 years before
because everybody had running water, everyone</a>
01:07:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h07m16s">had enough heat for the winter, you know.</a>
01:07:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h07m18s">Everyone had shelter, and so on.</a>
01:07:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h07m20s">So you figure, with regards to wealth, once
you’ve got running water, reliable shelter,</a>
01:07:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h07m27s">heat, and maybe air conditioning if you live
in the desert, and you’re not hungry, you’ve</a>
01:07:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h07m33s">got ninety percent of what wealth can deliver.</a>
01:07:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h07m36s">Really, all things considered.</a>
01:07:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h07m37s">The rest of it is just status and luxury items,
but the relationship between position of status</a>
01:07:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h07m46s">and death rates remain constant.</a>
01:07:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h07m50s">So that’s very interesting, and we know
that that’s true from a lot of other studies</a>
01:07:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h07m54s">as well.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h07m55s">It’s like control for absolute wealth, there’s
still problems with hierarchy, and that seems</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h08m00s">mediated at least in part by serotonin, and
serotonin regulates negative emotion, and</a>

old, and so you can give serotonin injections</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h09m19s">systems the lobsters use act within the dominance
hierarchy and react to, it’s the same in</a>
01:09:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h09m28s">us.</a>
01:09:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h09m29s">And so, not only is that stable, it’s well
ridiculously stable.</a>
01:09:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h09m36s">So one of the things we could say is that
one of the games that seems emergent and real</a>
01:09:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h09m43s">is a dominance hierarchy.</a>
01:09:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h09m44s">And then we might ask what exactly constitutes
a dominance hierarchy, and we might ask well</a>
01:09:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h09m49s">what constitutes a highly functional hierarchy
versus a dysfunctional hierarchy, and even</a>
01:09:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h09m55s">what does highly functional and dysfunctional
mean.</a>
01:09:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h09m58s">Well we have to define all those terms.</a>
01:09:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h10m01s">We will, as we move forward.</a>
01:10:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h10m02s">But the point I’m making is - and this is
a bit of a contradiction with the initial</a>
01:10:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h10m08s">system I made with the tight distinction between
the scientific world and the objective world</a>
01:10:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h10m14s">because I’m also talking about the evolution
of games, and you know, the study of evolution</a>
01:10:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h10m21s">is a scientific study and the dominance hierarchy
is a biological phenomena and so in some sense</a>
01:10:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h10m28s">it’s also a game, and it’s also a moral
structure and so there are levels of analysis</a>
01:10:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h10m32s">where these things start to get tangled together,
and that’s partly what we’ll try to sort</a>
01:10:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h10m35s">out.</a>
01:10:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h10m37s">So, we’ll do that in the future because
it’s very very complicated.</a>
01:10:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcmWssTLFv0#t=01h10m42s">Alright now we’re gonna step back a little
bit.</a>
