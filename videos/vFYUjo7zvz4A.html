00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h00m04s">This is mapped out on the hippocampus more most particularly by Geoffrey Gray who is influenced by</a>

00:00:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h00m20s">Which is an AI?</a>
00:00:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h00m22s">which he's the father of artificial intelligence and</a>
00:00:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h00m26s">some of that was actually</a>
00:00:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h00m28s">integrated as well in to Piaget Ian thought because Piaget and white wine er Norbert liner and</a>
00:00:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h00m33s">Luria if I remember correctly all went to the same conference back in the early 1920s</a>
00:00:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h00m39s">Mid 1920s and heard Norbert Wiener speak so that's how cybernetic Theory got built into some of these underlying</a>
00:00:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h00m46s">Theories and sort of manifested itself everywhere so gray</a>
00:00:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h00m49s">Gray uses a model very much like this derived from cybernetic theory and so here's the idea</a>
00:00:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h00m54s">How does the brain work you have a target in mind</a>
00:00:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h00m58s">And you act to to manifest the target you act to transform the world into the target</a>
00:00:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h01m04s">and</a>
00:01:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h01m04s">Then you compare the consequence of your actions to the target  if they match then that's a good thing  if they don't match</a>
00:01:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h01m10s">Then that's what it where negative emotion comes from okay?</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h01m13s">So how does that work the hippocampus seems to be central to that so it detects mismatch, so?</a>
00:01:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h01m18s">so in the classic</a>
00:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h01m20s">behavioral theory in this so this would be Gray's theory you have your expectations of the world so that would be your model and</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h01m27s">You have your sensory input, which is the real world and then the hippocampus is mapping one on to the other?</a>
00:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h01m34s">One from a top-down stream one from a bottom-up stream and saying match match match match</a>
00:01:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h01m40s">And as long as everything matches then the hippocampus. This is an oversimplification keeps the subcortical</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h01m47s">Emotional systems inhibited because you don't need them</a>
00:01:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h01m50s">except for maybe my mild positive emotion to keep you moving forward if there's a mismatch</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h01m56s">That's anxiety the anxiety system gets disinhibited because it's so on it doesn't get activate it gets disinhibited that freezes you and all the other</a>
00:01:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h02m04s">motivational systems are primed because god only knows what you're gonna have to do next okay, so</a>
00:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h02m09s">then if</a>
00:02:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h02m11s">You make a mistake</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h02m12s">given that scheme you</a>
00:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h02m13s">Have to modify the world in order to rectify the mistake you have to modify your motor output</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h02m18s">So that you put the world back in order and that's basically Gray's model</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h02m22s">But Gray's model is insufficient because gray presumes that what you're comparing</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h02m28s">Your expectation with is the real world</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h02m33s">But you don't have access to the real world what really happens is that your brain compares the model of</a>
00:02:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h02m39s">The world that you want to have happen so it's desired and not expected with the model of the world</a>
00:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h02m45s">That you think is happening. They're both models</a>
00:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h02m48s">There's no direct contact with the truth, and so what that means and this is what's horrible about</a>
00:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h02m54s">This is that if your model fails</a>
00:02:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h02m56s">It doesn't only mean that you have to adjust your expectation and change your motor activity</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h03m02s">it means you might have to bloody well retool your</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h03m05s">perceptions. Well, that's a lot more horrifying than just having to change your motor output. If you betray me</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h03m11s">Then I have to see you differently and you know I've we've interacted a long time</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h03m17s">I've built up a hell of a model of you</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h03m19s">you know it's taken a</a>
00:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h03m20s">Tremendous amount of effort to generate and I may have used that model as a predicate for all sorts of other</a>
00:03:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h03m26s">Plants which is what you do with an intimate relationship</a>
00:03:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h03m29s">And so then if you do something that indicates a true mismatch it isn't only that I have to adjust my actions</a>
00:03:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h03m37s">God only knows what I'm gonna. Have to retool. I may even have to read two of my perceptions of myself</a>
00:03:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h03m42s">I'm a lot more gullible than I thought I was for example and god only knows what the implications of that are if</a>
00:03:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h03m48s">You're close to me, and you could do this to me</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h03m52s">Is that my flaw and environment am I carrying that into other relationships? It's an absolute catastrophe and so gray actually</a>
00:03:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h04m00s">underestimated the degree of severity of mismatch because he only said well, it was motor output and and</a>
00:04:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h04m07s">Andrey Andrey world adjusting that would have to be repaired not perception because like most</a>
00:04:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h04m12s">Behaviorist see the behaviorist had this idea of stimulus right the stimulus produces the response it's like okay</a>
00:04:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h04m19s">What stimulus well they never went there they just assumed that the stimulus spoke for itself?</a>
00:04:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h04m25s">But it doesn't that's the fundamental weak of behavioral</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h04m29s">Is that the reason they could get rid of the mind was because they hid it?</a>
00:04:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h04m32s">Invisibly inside the idea of the stimulus, which is all of a sudden, not just something that was a sense</a>
00:04:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUjo7zvz4A#t=00h04m38s">Like a piece of sense data, but that had motivation built into it well no</a>
