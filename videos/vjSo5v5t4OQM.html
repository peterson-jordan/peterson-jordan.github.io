<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h00m22s">when you say... when you pare a sentence down to "What is intelligence?"...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h00m27s">- the sentence is problematic, because part of it is a question about</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h00m33s">"if and how such a thing might manifest itself in the world?"</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h00m38s">There's a fact out there -or set of facts- that corresponds to intelligence</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h00m42s">but the other problem is, well, what do you <em>mean</em> when you say "intelligence"?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h00m46s">And you kinda have to nail that down, if you're gonna have</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h01m04s">People have been studying intelligence, IQ intelligence, since the 1920s</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h01m09s">and it's a very well established branch of psychology.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h01m12s">One of the things I have to tell you about it -IQ research- is that</a>
00:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h01m15s">if you don't buy IQ research, you might as well throw away all the rest of Psychology.</a>
00:01:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h01m22s">And the reason for that is that...</a>
00:01:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h01m24s">The psychologists, first of all, who "developed" intelligence testing, were among the</a>
00:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h01m28s">early psychologists who instantiated the statistical techniques that all psychologists use</a>
00:01:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h01m34s">to verify and test all of their hypotheses.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h01m37s">So you end up throwing the baby out with the bathwater.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h01m40s">And the "IQ people" have defined intelligence in a more stringent and accurate way</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h01m47s">than we've been able to define almost any other psychological construct, and so...</a>
00:01:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h01m52s">if you toss out the one that's the most well defined</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h01m55s">then you're kind of stuck with the problem of what are you going to do with all the ones that you have left over</a>
00:01:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h01m58s">that are nowhere near as well defined or as well measured or as...</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h02m05s">or whose predictive validity is much less and has been demonstrated with much less vigor and clarity.</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h02m11s">Anyways, despite all that,</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h02m13s">people have posited a number of different intelligences</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h02m16s">and reasonably so, because, if you think of intelligence as...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h02m22s">that which might move you forward successfully in the world;</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h02m25s">obviously, there's a fair number of phenomena</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h02m27s">that are associated with individuals that might fit into that category.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h02m31s">So we have...</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h02m36s">... people have made these distinctions.</a>
00:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h02m40s">Bob Sternberg, for example, has distinguished between</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h02m43s">practical vs analytical intelligence</a>
00:02:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h02m46s">and he kind of thinks of practical as like "street smarts"</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h02m49s">and has attempted to dissociate that from the kind of analytical intelligence that</a>
00:02:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h02m55s">...that characterizes more straight IQ research. I don't think he's done it successfully as well, at all</a>
00:02:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h03m00s">and since the 1990s interest in his practical intelligence has declined precipitously, because...</a>
00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h03m07s">when it is matched head-to-head with standard IQ intelligence</a>
00:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h03m11s">the IQ intelligence eats up all the variability.</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h03m14s">What's really happened, as far as I can tell so far, is that</a>
00:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h03m17s">when we're trying to predict people's course through life</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h03m21s">IQ does a very good job, and then one of the traits does a very good job as well</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h03m24s">which is conscientiousness</a>
00:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h03m28s">- but it doesn't do as good a job as IQ.</a>
00:03:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h03m30s">Now, that partly might be because we can't measure conscientiousness very well.</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h03m35s">We're stuck with self reports or maybe I could gather peer reports about you</a>
00:03:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h03m39s">or I could gather your parents' reports about you, or teacher's reports</a>
00:03:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h03m43s">and each of those seems to</a>
00:03:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h03m45s">pick up a little bit more of the pattern,</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h03m47s">because you know yourself, but other people know you</a>
00:03:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h03m50s">differently than you know yourself, and there's still some accuracy in that.</a>
00:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h03m53s">You can get multiple rater reports of something like conscientiousness,</a>
00:03:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h03m57s">and that will up its predictive validity.</a>
00:03:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h03m59s">But, in the final analysis, the best you seem to be able to do with conscientiousness</a>
00:03:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h04m03s">is about a .4 correlation with long term performance,</a>
00:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h04m06s">whereas with IQ, in complex jobs, you can probably get .5 and maybe .6.</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h04m12s">So .5 is 25% of the variants -you're going to square it- .6 is 36% of the variants</a>
00:04:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h04m18s">and .4 is 16% of the variants.</a>
00:04:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h04m21s">So even at the "low end"... let's say, "high end" for conscientiousness is .4... or 16%,</a>
00:04:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h04m28s">"Low end" for IQ is .5 or 25%,</a>
00:04:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h04m31s">"Low end" estimates of IQ make it 1.5 times more powerful than</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h04m37s">And I think that's about right. You'd think "Why do we even have to debate this"?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h04m41s">Because it's so bloody obvious to me that intelligence is a major predictor of life success; I mean...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h05m00s">Well it shouldn't be a contentious statement; it's self-evident!</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h05m36s">So, let's take a look at how</a>
00:05:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h05m39s">intelligence has been assessed and why.</a>
00:05:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h05m42s">And then, you can make up your own mind.</a>
00:05:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h05m44s">Anyways, here's some of the examples of other "forms" of intelligence.</a>
00:05:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h05m49s">And so, then the question is: what does it mean to have a different <em>form</em> of Intelligence?</a>
00:05:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h05m54s">Would Form A and Form B be completely uncorrelated?</a>
00:05:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h05m58s">Like extroversion and say, neuroticism? Or would they be slightly correlated? Or would they be...</a>
00:05:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h06m02s">... highly correlated? And then, you might ask: well, how highly correlated do they have to be...</a>
00:06:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h06m06s">... before they're the same thing?</a>
00:06:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h06m09s">Or, how uncorrelated do they have to be before they're different things?</a>
00:06:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h06m12s">And actually, the answer to that comes down to something like "practical utility".</a>
00:06:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h06m16s">It's like... imagine I'm trying to figure out how well you'll do in University.</a>
00:06:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h06m20s">And I measure one thing... and it's correlated at .7 with another thing I measure about you.</a>
00:06:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h06m25s">Well, then I might say "are those two things the same, or different?" They're pretty highly correlated...</a>
00:06:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h06m29s">... your high on one means you're going to be high in the other.</a>
00:06:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h06m31s">Well, so... is there any utility in measuring both things?</a>
00:06:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h06m35s">And the way you figure that out, actually, is: you do it statistically.</a>
00:06:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h06m39s">So, we take the target, which might be your performance across University.</a>
00:06:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h06m43s">And then, we say: "Well, can we predict your performance across University better</a>
00:06:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h06m47s">by using one variable? Or two variables?"</a>
00:06:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h06m51s">So, when you enter them both into a regression equation - all a regression equation does:</a>
00:06:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h06m55s">It's quite simple; So, you're trying to predict a target...</a>
00:06:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h06m59s">... and the regression equation tells you: how well you can predict that target...</a>
00:06:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h07m04s">... if you know another fact.</a>
00:07:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h07m08s">Now, then it gets a little complicated, because that's a correlation: how well you can predict B with A.</a>
00:07:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h07m13s">Well, a regression will say, how much you can predict C if you know A and B...</a>
00:07:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h07m20s">... or A and B and C and D and E, because you can use multiple predictors...</a>
00:07:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h07m23s">... and you can weigh them, so it might be 2xA + 1xB = C.</a>
00:07:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h07m28s">And that's all a regression equation does; It's just multiplication and addition, very very straightforward.</a>
00:07:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h07m33s">And so, two variables are sufficiently different functionally...</a>
00:07:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h07m37s">... if you can use both of them simultaneously to predict something of interest.</a>
00:07:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h07m42s">So again, it's a tool-like approach -this is how the psychometricians do it.</a>
00:07:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h07m45s">It's something real.</a>
00:07:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h07m47s">Well, it's real if you can measure it and it helps you predict.</a>
00:07:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h07m50s">That's how it's defined. So, then you might say:</a>
00:07:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h07m55s">"Are there these multiple intelligences?</a>
00:07:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h07m57s">Well, the first question would be: "What do you mean by <em>are there</em>?"</a>
00:07:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h08m02s">And the answer to that would be: "Well, let's specify the question.", since we're going to be scientific about it.</a>
00:08:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h08m07s">Let's predict how well people do in University: we'll start with the assumption that:</a>
00:08:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h08m13s">If intelligence isn't associated with University success, then you're probably not talking about intelligence.</a>
00:08:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h08m20s">Now, you could argue that, right?</a>
00:08:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h08m22s">Because you could say: "Well, Intelligence has nothing to do with University success."</a>
00:08:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h08m25s">But, that's a definitional matter! We'd have to agree to begin with.</a>
00:08:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h08m29s">Is it reasonable to start with the presupposition that intelligence...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h08m36s">Well, I think you have to be daft to deny that initial proposition; although, you could...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h08m44s">Because you could say it was privilege, or socio-economic status, or...</a>
00:08:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h08m48s">... any number of sociological phenomena, and some of those are obviously relevant.</a>
00:08:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h08m52s">Social class, for example...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h08m54s">Because, you know, if you're in a higher social class</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h09m01s">- if you're in a higher social class, you're more likely to go into University</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h11m50s">So, extroverted people are more socially fluent - or, are we going to call that intelligence?</a>
00:11:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h11m54s">No! We're gonna call that "personality". We're gonna call that "extroversion"</a>
00:11:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h11m58s">and we're gonna call stress-tolerance.
You could say, well...</a>
00:11:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h12m01s">"If you can tolerate more stress, you're more intelligent!" It's like, well, no - that isn't how we've defined it.</a>
00:12:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h12m06s">We're gonna define that as being lower in neuroticism.</a>
00:12:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h12m09s">If you're cooperative, you're more intelligent - that's "emotional intelligence".</a>
00:12:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h12m13s">Well, what? You're less intelligent if you're competitive? Well, no...</a>
00:12:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h12m17s">So, we parse that off to agreeableness. So then the question might be:</a>
00:12:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h12m20s">"Is there anything left of these so-called 'intelligences'..."</a>
00:12:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h12m23s">".. once you control for personality and IQ?" and the answer is: NO!</a>
00:12:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h12m28s">Nothing. Nothing left of them!</a>
00:12:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h12m31s">And the people who keep pushing these ideas, keep trying to push them...</a>
00:12:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h12m34s">because they don't like the idea of real individual differences.</a>
00:12:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h12m38s">And to me, that's just a matter of stickin' your damn head in the sand, because it's obvious...</a>
00:12:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h12m43s">Here: you're going to have a child.</a>
00:12:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h12m45s">You want the child to have an IQ of 65 or 145?</a>
00:12:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h12m48s">Decide.</a>
00:12:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h12m49s">Okay, so you're all going to vote...</a>
00:12:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h12m51s">Okay, you think any one of you is going to vote to have a child with an IQ of 65?</a>
00:12:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h12m54s">That child is going to have a hard time developing even Linguistic ability.</a>
00:12:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h12m59s">They're never going to learn to read.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h13m01s">They're never going to leave home</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h13m03s">- in all likelihood.
So which child are you going to pick?</a>
00:13:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSo5v5t4OQM#t=00h13m06s">Well, so do you believe in intelligence, or not? Well, obviously... if you have any sense...</a>
