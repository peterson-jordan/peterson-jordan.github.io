<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h00m24s">then all you've got left is misery and suffering</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h00m31s">but once you've set up that goal structure lets say</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h00m36s">and that's really- in many ways..</a>

00:00:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h00m50s">and then you use everything you've learned</a>
00:00:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h00m51s">as a means of building that.. person that you want to be</a>

00:00:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h01m00s">and it's important to distinguish between those</a>
00:01:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h01m02s">because that's partly and this is back down to the micro routine analysis</a>
00:01:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h01m06s">so while you're gonna try to make yourself more industrious,</a>
00:01:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h01m08s">okay number 1 specify your goals.</a>
00:01:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h01m11s">because how are you going to hit something if you don't know what it is</a>
00:01:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h01m13s">that isn't going to happen</a>
00:01:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h01m14s">and often people wont specify their goals too</a>
00:01:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h01m16s">because they don't like to specify conditions for failure</a>
00:01:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h01m19s">so if you keep yourself all vague and foggy</a>
00:01:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h01m22s">which is real easy because that's just a matter of not doing as well</a>
00:01:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h01m25s">then you don't know when you fail</a>
00:01:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h01m27s">and people might say well</a>
00:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h01m28s">i don't wanna know when i fail because that's painful</a>
00:01:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h01m31s">so i'll keep myself blind about when i fail</a>
00:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h01m34s">that's fine except you'll fail all the time then</a>
00:01:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h01m36s">you just wont know it until you failed so badly that you're done</a>
00:01:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h01m40s">and that can easily happen by the time you're 40</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h01m43s">so.. so</a>
00:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h01m44s">i would recommend that you don't let that happen</a>
00:01:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h01m46s">so that's willful blindness</a>
00:01:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h01m48s">you could've known but you chose not to</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h01m50s">okay so once you get your goal structure set up</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h01m53s">you think okay if i get half this life</a>
00:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h01m55s">looks like that might be worth living</a>
00:01:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h01m57s">despite the fact that it's going to be.. you know</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h01m59s">anxiety provoking and threatening</a>
00:01:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h02m01s">and there's gonna be some suffering and loss involved and all of that.. obviously</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h02m05s">the goal is to have a vision for your life</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h02m08s">such that</a>
00:02:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h02m09s">all things considered that justifies your effort</a>
00:02:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h02m13s">okay so.. then what do you do</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h02m15s">then you turn down to the micro routine its like</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h02m18s">okay this is what i'm aiming for</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h02m19s">how does that instantiate it self</a>
00:02:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h02m22s">day to day, week to week, month to month</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h02m24s">and that's where something like a schedule</a>
00:02:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h02m26s">can be unbelievably useful, Google calender</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h02m28s">make a damn schedule... and stick to it</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h02m31s">okay so what is the rule with a schedule</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h02m34s">its not a bloody prison...</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h02m36s">that's the first thing that people do wrong..</a>
00:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h02m38s">is well.. i don't like to follow a schedule</a>
00:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h02m40s">what kind of schedule are you setting up?</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h02m42s">well.. i have to do this then i have to do this</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h02m46s">and then i just go play some video games</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h02m48s">because who wants to do all these things that i have to do</a>
00:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h02m50s">it's like WRONG. set the damn schedule up</a>
00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h02m54s">so that you have the day you want</a>
00:02:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h02m56s">that's the trick, its like okay i've got tomorrow</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h02m58s">if i was going to set it up so it's the best possible day i could have</a>
00:02:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h03m03s">practically speaking..</a>
00:03:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h03m05s">what would it look like</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h03m06s">then you schedule that,</a>
00:03:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h03m08s">and obviously there's a bit of responsibility that's gonna go along with that</a>
00:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h03m11s">because if you have any sense</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h03m13s">one of the things you're gonna insist upon is that at the end of the day</a>
00:03:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h03m16s">you're not in worse shape than you were at the beginning of the day</a>
00:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h03m20s">cuz that's a stupid day</a>
00:03:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h03m22s">if you have a bunch of these in a row you'll just dig yourself a hole</a>
00:03:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h03m26s">and then just bury yourself in it</a>
00:03:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h03m28s">sorry that's just not a good strategy</a>
00:03:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h03m30s">it's a bad strategy.. so</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h03m32s">maybe 20% of your day has to be responsibility and obligation</a>
00:03:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h03m36s">and maybe it's more than that depending on how far behind you are</a>
00:03:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h03m38s">but even that you can ask yourself okay</a>
00:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h03m41s">well i've got these responsibilities</a>
00:03:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h03m43s">i have to schedule the damn things in</a>
00:03:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h03m45s">what's the right ratio of responsibility to reward</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h03m49s">and you can ask yourself that just like you'd negotiate with someone working for you</a>
00:03:49</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h06m00s">because you probably waste like 6 hours a day</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h06m12s">so this is investment time,</a>

00:06:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h06m18s">so let's say it's $50 an hour which is perfectly reasonable</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h06m46s">and if the answer is no then maybe you should do something else with your time</a>
00:06:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h06m50s">it depends on whether or not you think that your time is worth while</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h06m54s">but the funny thing about not assuming that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h14m57s">and you might say well that's better than living a meaningless existence, it's better for it to matter</a>

00:16:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h16m40s">well think about it from the hypothalamic perspective</a>
00:16:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h16m42s">so we could say one thing that motivation does is set goals</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h16m46s">we could say that emotions track progress towards goals..</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h16m49s">I'm gonna use that schema even though it's not exactly right</a>
00:16:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h16m52s">so you say well motivation determines where you're gonna aim</a>
00:16:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h16m55s">so if you're hungry you're gonna aim at something to eat</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h17m00s">so that you zero out everything that isn't relevant to that task</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h17m19s">those things cause positive emotion.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h17m59s">and you know, one of the things we're going to try to sort out is how do you decide</a>
00:17:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h18m04s">when you've encountered an obstacle that's so big that you should just quit and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h18m07s">go do something else because that's not obvious.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h18m10s">you know and.. you can get into counter productive persistence pretty easily</a>
00:18:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h18m15s">so.. we don't know how people solve that problem it's a really complicated one</a>
00:18:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h18m19s">so anyways we're gonna work on that scenario...</a>

00:18:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h18m30s">so it's not a goal it's not a drive and it's not a collection of behaviors</a>
00:18:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h18m34s">it's of little personality and the personality has a viewpoint..</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h18m44s">you can see this in addiction, most particularly.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h18m48s">so one of the things that you find often with people who are alcoholic</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h18m52s">is they lie all the time and that's because they built a little</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h18m59s">or a big one, maybe it's 90% of the personality</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h19m03s">and one of the things that consists of</a>
00:19:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h19m07s">is all the rationalizations that they've used over the years</a>

00:19:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h19m17s">and so when the person is off maybe they're addicted to meth or something like that</a>
00:19:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h19m21s">where we know that the addiction is more..</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h19m28s">they'll say anything...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h19m34s">and if they happen to be deceptive, whatever, it doesn't matter</a>

00:19:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h19m44s">you reinforce all those rationales that you use to get the drug then</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h19m53s">one way of thinking about them is they set goals</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h19m55s">but it's not the right way of thinking about it</a>
00:19:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h19m57s">they produce a whole framework of interpretation..</a>
00:19:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h19m59s">and so we're gonna think about that framework of interpretation</a>
00:19:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h20m02s">and then emotions emerge inside of that</a>
00:20:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h20m06s">so that's it so the world is framed, motivation set goals. you could say the world</a>
00:20:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h20m10s">has to be framed. so motivation sets that frame whose goals emotions perceptions and actions</a>
00:20:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h20m15s">and then actions track progress so..</a>
00:20:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h20m18s">positive emotion says you're moving forward properly towards your goal</a>
00:20:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h20m22s">and if you encounter something you don't expect you stop</a>
00:20:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h20m25s">that's anxiety it's like oh we're not where we thought we were</a>
00:20:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h20m28s">and so we don't know what to do? so we should stop because we don't know where we are,</a>
00:20:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h20m32s">what we're doing, stop, frozen.</a>
00:20:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h20m35s">and then the more powerful negative emotions like pain</a>
00:20:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h20m38s">they might make you get out of there</a>
00:20:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h20m40s">so emotions, forward, stop reverse. that's your emotions within that motivated frame.</a>
00:20:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h20m49s">and that's another example of how your mind is embedded in your body</a>
00:20:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h20m52s">you know emotions are like they're-</a>
00:20:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h20m54s">they're offshoots of action tendencies that's the right way to think about it</a>
00:20:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h20m58s">because action is everything.. fundamentally</a>
00:20:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h21m02s">so what are some basic motivations?</a>
00:21:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h21m04s">most of these are regulated by the hypothalamus by the way</a>
00:21:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h21m07s">and that tells you just how important a control system is</a>
00:21:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h21m09s">the other thing that's useful to know about the hypothalamus is that</a>
00:21:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h21m12s">it has projections going up from it that are like tree trunks</a>
00:21:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h21m15s">and inhibitory projections coming down that are like grape vines</a>
00:21:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h21m21s">so you can kind of control your hypothalamus</a>
00:21:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h21m22s">as long as it's not on too much</a>
00:21:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h21m24s">but if it's on in any serious way it's like- it.. it wins.</a>
00:21:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h21m29s">so partly what you do to stop yourself from falling under the Dominion of your hypothalamus</a>
00:21:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h21m35s">is to never ever be anywhere where it's action is necessary</a>

00:21:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h21m42s">because you might find yourself in a situation</a>
00:21:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h21m44s">where panicked defensive aggression is immediately necessary</a>
00:21:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h21m48s">you probably don't want that</a>
00:21:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h21m49s">you don't want the panic you don't want the terror you don't want the frenzied fight</a>
00:21:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h21m54s">you don't want any of that you don't want to have to run away in absolute panic.</a>
00:21:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h21m57s">so you just don't go there</a>
00:21:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h21m59s">and a huge a huge part of how we regulate our emotions</a>
00:21:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h22m03s">is just by never going anywhere where we have to experience them</a>
00:22:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h22m07s">and so that has very little to do with internal inhibitory control</a>
00:22:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEsTPaUZF0#t=00h22m10s">and everything to do with staying where you belong</a>
