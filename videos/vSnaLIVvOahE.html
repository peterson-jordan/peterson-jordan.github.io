<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h00m03s">So and that's very interesting observation because since the Chaos is virtually infinite. It's a real questions where the hell</a>
00:00:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h00m10s">Do you put it?</a>
00:00:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h00m10s">Well you put it in what you ignore</a>
00:00:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h00m12s">and you can ignore it as long as it isn't actively interfering with your movement forward you can assume that it's</a>
00:00:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h00m19s">That it doesn't matter that it isn't matter that. It doesn't matter same thing</a>
00:00:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h00m26s">All right, so here's the kicker</a>
00:00:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h00m27s">There's one more class of things that you can run into along the way</a>
00:00:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h00m32s">And this is where the chaos breaks through so let's say</a>
00:00:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h00m42s">you're moving from point a to point B and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h00m45s">Something that you don't expect oh curves</a>
00:00:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h00m48s">and it gets in the way, so let's</a>
00:00:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h00m52s">Say that you're living with someone and maybe you kind of like them. You're not married</a>
00:00:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h00m56s">So you don't like them that much because otherwise you'd ask them to marry you, but anyways</a>
00:00:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h01m03s">and so how quarter of youth is looking for something better and 3/4 of view is half satisfied something like that and</a>
00:01:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h01m11s">Then person because we're ambivalent about such things and then the person you discover or the person announces that they'd be having an affair</a>
00:01:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h01m18s">Okay, so then how are you supposed to respond emotionally to that well the part of you that wasn't all that committed to the relationship</a>
00:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h01m25s">Is kind of exhilarated by that and then the 3/4 of you that's half</a>
00:01:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h01m29s">Satisfied is hurt and and you're going to exploit that part for sure in the ensuing</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h01m33s">discussions and not mention the oh that's kind of exciting that you you know betrayed me that way, so</a>
00:01:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h01m41s">But the point is is that you that's a whole now</a>
00:01:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h01m44s">What's happened as a whole has?</a>
00:01:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h01m46s">You have this structure that you're walking on like ice like the thin ice that you're skating on and now there's a hole in it</a>
00:01:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h01m53s">And the hole we don't even know how deep the hole is but you know there's a hole there</a>
00:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h01m57s">And so now you're anxious about it though. Maybe also a little bit excited because God only knows what's down there, but</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h02m03s">But you don't know how what to do with that hole because it could spread very badly on you</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h02m09s">It could be that you know the whole relationship was a facade</a>
00:02:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h02m13s">And that all your relationships have been facades and that the reason that is because you're so damn shallow that it's impossible</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h02m20s">for you to have a</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h02m21s">Relationship that isn't just a facade</a>
00:02:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h02m22s">And that's partly because you don't pay any attention to other people and it's also partly because you're malevolent and selfish</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h02m28s">so that's a nasty thing to discover or maybe that's the sort of person that you're</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h02m33s">Attracting which would make sense actually if that's the sort of person that you are and so</a>
00:02:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h02m37s">so there are certain things that you can encounter that basically unglue you and</a>
00:02:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h02m42s">What happens is that those moments of being unglued travel up that entire Hierarchy of presuppositions</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h02m49s">Right because the one of the logical conclusions to being betrayed in a relationship</a>
00:02:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h02m53s">Is that you are that you're truly a bad person now another?</a>
00:02:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h02m59s">Equally logical conclusion is that the person that you're with is really a bad person and another logical conclusion is all</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h03m06s">People are truly bad people you know I mean</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h03m10s">It in microwave that in microwaves. You can't trust anyone you can't trust women you can't trust men</a>
00:03:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h03m16s">You can't trust human beings you can't trust yourself. The whole place is a catastrophe. It's a nightmare</a>
00:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaLIVvOahE#t=00h03m21s">Well, then you can fall through into</a>
