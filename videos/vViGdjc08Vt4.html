<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h01m01s">Pitfalls hierarchies might produce. You cannot lay them at the feet of the West's</a>
00:01:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h01m07s">Patriarchy or capitalism. It's like that's a non-starter you're wrong and not just a little bit wrong</a>
00:01:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h01m13s">You're so seriously wrong that if you insist upon doing that, you won't even achieve your own aims</a>
00:01:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h01m19s">Because you're actually not grappling with the problem. The problem is if</a>
00:01:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h01m23s">hierarchies are a problem, which they are the problem is way more serious than</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h01m28s">mere capitalism it's way deeper and if you're actually interested in rectifying the</a>
00:01:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h01m36s">Constantly the negative consequences of hierarchies. Then you're gonna have to get a lot more sophisticated than they're then you're idiot Marxism</a>
00:01:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h01m43s">So so so part of the elaboration of that argument is well</a>
00:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h01m49s">hierarchies are inevitable because</a>
00:01:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h01m50s">We have to solve complex problems and we have to solve them socially and when you implement a solution to a complex problem</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h01m57s">Socially you produce a hierarchy because some people are better at the implementation than others</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h02m02s">so there's a hierarchy of competence and then there's a hierarchy of distribution of the Spoils and</a>
00:02:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h02m08s">so and in both of those hierarchies you get a</a>
00:02:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h02m11s">disproportionate</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h02m12s">Clumping of resource at the top and dispossession at the bottom. It's in the nature of hierarchies</a>
00:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h02m17s">So what's the left for the left is to remind?</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h02m22s">those who are benefiting from the hierarchies that the hierarchy</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h02m26s">comes at a cost and the cost is the clumping of people at the bottom and that</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h02m33s">That's an eternal cost and it's not trivial</a>
00:02:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h02m36s">And so that's what the left should be properly focused on the Left should be providing</a>
00:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h02m41s">The voice of those who are dispossessed by hierarchies and the right should be saying yeah</a>
00:02:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h02m48s">But the damn hierarchies are necessary and they're not only necessary, but they're also productive</a>
00:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h02m55s">Then the left says yes, but they tilt towards</a>
00:02:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h02m59s">Tyranny, and they can be occupied inappropriately by people who are playing games of power</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h03m05s">Fair enough the right has to take that into account the hierarchy can reach it reach it if I and is</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h03m10s">Likely to do that and it can be taken over by people who are corrupt and that's likely to happen. And so</a>
00:03:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h03m17s">But but it's okay because the dialogue can work out the the right can say well, yeah</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h03m21s">we need the damn hierarchies and they need to be buttressed and the left can say yes, but</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h03m27s">They have to be maintained properly so they don't deteriorate and degenerate and and I think that's I think that's ancient wisdom</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h03m34s">I think the ancient Egyptians had figured that out in their symbolic</a>
00:03:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h03m38s">Representations so now when the left goes too far it does something like say well</a>
00:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h03m45s">How about no hierarchies? It's like no, how about not?</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h03m48s">wrong because all that happens if you flatten one of the things that happens if you flatten out the hierarchy is that you can't even</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h03m55s">Organize your perceptions</a>
00:03:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h03m57s">you can't perceive the world without looking at the world through a hierarchy of value and</a>
00:03:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h04m02s">if</a>
00:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h04m03s">Because you can't perceive the world unless you make one thing more</a>
00:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h04m06s">Important than all the other things because you don't even know what to look at</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h04m09s">and</a>
00:04:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h04m09s">if one thing isn't more important than all the other things then you have nothing to aim at if you have nothing to aim at</a>
00:04:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h04m14s">Then you have no meaning in your life. So the left can't just demolish the hierarchies in the name of some equality of outcome</a>
00:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h04m21s">Let's say because you blow out the future</a>
00:04:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h04m24s">You leave people aimless and you destroy the very institutions that allow people to make competent progress in the world</a>
00:04:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h04m30s">That's not an acceptable outcome. So we have to we have to agree to live with the tension</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGdjc08Vt4#t=00h04m39s">Necessity for hierarchies the proclivity for them to pathologize and</a>
