<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBl5PfA5HfU#t=00h05m47s">Okay, so, and what exactly would you say is the relationship between, Dawa</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBl5PfA5HfU#t=00h05m52s">And and jihad, you're formulating it</a>
00:05:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBl5PfA5HfU#t=00h05m54s">By the sounds of it that Dawa is the precursor to jihad and are the concepts reasonably separable</a>
00:05:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBl5PfA5HfU#t=00h06m00s">And and I guess a subsidiary question of that would be we're talking about radical Islam</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBl5PfA5HfU#t=00h06m12s">And I'm also curious about your feelings about exactly that distinction and how such a thing might be pursued</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBl5PfA5HfU#t=00h06m20s">So my approach to it is there is one Islam, but there are three sets of Muslims. There is one Islam</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBl5PfA5HfU#t=00h06m40s">Now if you look at the different sets of Muslims what you see is one set of Muslims who just adhere to the religious</a>
