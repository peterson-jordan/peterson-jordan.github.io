<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h03m47s">just after Stalin died, there was a bit of a thaw in the Soviet Union with regards to internal repression.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h03m54s">In the early 1960s, Solzhenitsyn published a book called "One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,"</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h04m00s">which was a story about one day in the life — his life, really — inside one of these so-called "gulag archipelago" camps.</a>
00:04:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h04m07s">Now, he called it the "gulag archipelago" because</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h04m09s">an "archipelago" is a chain of islands, and so Solzhenitsyn likened the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h04m20s">He likened that to a series of islands, and hence the metaphor.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h04m26s">And "One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich" was one of the first publications released in the Soviet Union that dared make public</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h04m34s">what had happened inside these camps, at least initially.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h04m37s">Now, that thought didn't last very long, but that book had a tremendous effect.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h04m42s">It's a short book; it's worth reading.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h04m45s">After that, he spent— he wrote a number of other books which were also—</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h04m49s">He's a great literary figure; in the same category, I would say, as Tolstoy or Dostoevsky, which is,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h04m54s">like, really saying something, you know. Those two are perhaps the greatest literary figures who ever lived,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h04m59s">with the possible exception of Shakespeare.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h05m01s">He wrote this book called "The Gulag Archipelago," which is published in three volumes, each of which is about 700 pages long.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h05m22s">Well, Solzhenitsyn estimated the deaths in internal repression in the Soviet Union at</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h05m27s">something approximating sixty million, between 1919 and 1959.</a>
00:05:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h05m31s">Now, that doesn't count the death toll in the second World War, by the way.</a>
00:05:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h05m35s">Now, people have disputed those figures, but they're certainly in the tens of millions, and the low-end bounds are probably</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h05m41s">twenty million, and the high-end bounds are near what Solzhenitsyn estimated... He also estimated that the same kind of internal repression in Maoist China</a>
00:05:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h05m50s">cost a hundred million lives, and so you can imagine that the genuine historical figures, again, are subject to dispute,</a>
00:05:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h05m58s">but somewhere between fifty and a hundred million people. And one of the things that's really surprising to me</a>
00:05:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h06m03s">and that I think is absolutely reprehensible — absolutely reprehensible — is the fact that</a>
00:06:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h06m09s">this is not widespread knowledge among students in the West.any of these</a>
00:06:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h06m12s">it's because your education -</a>
00:06:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h06m14s">your historical  education</a>
00:06:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h15m17s">Establishing the legal and practical framework for a series of camps where political prisoners and ordinary criminals would be sentenced to forced labor.</a>
00:15:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h15m26s">One of the things that's quite interesting about the gulag camps, and this is something that's very relevant to understanding modern Russia is that</a>
00:15:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h15m33s">so, ordinary criminals were put into the camps, and so were political prisoners.</a>
00:15:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h15m39s">but the ordinary criminals, and so those would be rapists and murderers, let's say, as well as thieves</a>
00:15:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h15m40s">who were engaged in theft as an occupation.</a>
00:15:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h15m43s">Those were regarded by the Soviets as "socially friendly" elements.</a>
00:15:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h15m47s">And the reason for that was that they assumed that the reason that these people had turned to crime was because of the oppressive nature</a>
00:15:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h15m53s">of the previous Czarist/Capitalist system. And that the only reason that these criminals existed</a>
00:15:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h16m00s">was because they had been oppressed -- they were oppressed victims of that system</a>
00:16:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h16m04s">and so one of the convenient consequences of that absolutely insane doctrine</a>
00:16:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h16m09s">was that the Soviets put the ordinary criminals in charge of the camps.</a>
00:16:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h16m14s">And these were very, very seriously bad people, and so,</a>
00:16:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h16m17s">you can imagine the way that they treated the political prisoners</a>
00:16:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h16m20s">who were regarded as socially hostile elements,</a>
00:16:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h16m23s">sometimes because of their own hypothetically traitorous acts, but more often</a>
00:16:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h16m27s">merely as a consequence of their racial or ethnic identity,</a>
00:16:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h16m31s">or the fact that they were related by birth to, say, people who had been succcessful</a>
00:16:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h16m35s">under the previous systems, so who had any</a>
00:16:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h16m38s">any association with nobility or any association with were known as the Kulaks,</a>
00:16:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h16m43s">who were the only successful class of former peasants in the Soviet Union.</a>
00:16:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h16m48s">Because they were regarded as "privileged."</a>
00:16:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h16m51s">You may have heard that word more recently.</a>
00:16:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h16m53s">They were regarded as "privileged" and therefore as enemies of the state. And it didn't matter if it was your father, or your grandfather, or your great-grandfather</a>
00:16:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h16m59s">who happened to be "privileged,"</a>
00:16:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84uRYq0Uc8#t=00h17m02s">but the mere fact that you were a member of that group was sufficient reason to put you into a camp.</a>
