so far, all the fundamental myths of creation</a>
00:00:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h00m39s">that we've investigated so far, the two that
we're going to talk about in detail today</a>
00:00:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h00m44s">are probably the two stories that have had
more impact on the course of world history</a>
00:00:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h00m48s">than any other two.</a>
00:00:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h00m50s">I'm going to talk in some detail today about
the story of creation laid out in Genesis</a>
00:00:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h00m54s">and also the story of the Buddha's enlightenment.</a>
00:00:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h00m58s">Both stories are also characterized by a kind
of depth that's virtually elimitless.</a>
00:00:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h01m04s">And I think in some ways that the topics we're
going to discuss today are the most enlightening</a>
00:01:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h01m10s">of all the many ideas that we've traveled
through so far in this series.</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h01m19s">So, we're gonna be concentrating on an analysis
of this schema again.</a>
00:01:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h01m26s">The idea being here of course that the world
of experience, which is the world that mythology</a>
00:01:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h01m31s">is attempting to describe has these fundamental
constituent elements, one associated with</a>
00:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h01m37s">chaos or nature or the unknown, one associated
with culture or the great father or the predictable.</a>
00:01:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h01m45s">And another associated with the archetypical
son, the individual who's the offspring of</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h01m52s">the interplay of these two fundamental forces
But given that part of the purpose of this</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h01m57s">series is to elucidate the causes of war and
motivation for war, attention paid to the</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h02m04s">dualistic nature of the individual is of,
of paramount importance.</a>
00:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h02m08s">So we could say that just as nature has it's
terrible side and just as culture has its</a>
00:02:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h02m12s">terrible side, so the individual has his or
her terrible side.</a>
00:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h02m17s">And the depth of that, capacity say for atrocity
and vengefulness is just as deep as the depth</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h02m24s">of terror that the unknown itself holds.</a>
00:02:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h02m27s">I think this is a difficult, a difficult fact
for normal individuals to grasp, given that</a>
00:02:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h02m35s">we're highly motivated to view ourselves as,
if not precisely good, at least as relatively</a>
00:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h02m40s">harmless.</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h02m41s">But the evidence that as individuals we are
relatively harmless is very, very thin indeed.</a>
00:02:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h02m47s">And I don't think it's possible to understand
the depth of motivation for atrocity and social</a>
00:02:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h02m56s">conflict without coming to terms with the
capacity for evil that's characteristic of</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h02m59s">the individual.</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h03m00s">Now both the story in Genesis and the story
of the Buddha's enlightenment, lay bare in</a>
00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h03m05s">many ways the nature of the structure of individual
evil.</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h03m09s">And also not only it's structure, but its
motivation.</a>
00:03:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h03m11s">Why it is that people would turn more or less
voluntarily away from the good and embrace</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h03m18s">what can only be described as it's polar opposite.</a>
00:03:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h03m21s">So in addition to making reference to this
structural schema of course, we're also going</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h03m28s">to be discussing it's, the typical mode of
interaction of these elements of experience.</a>
00:03:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h03m37s">You may note for example that this diagram
with which you're now very familiar, the notion</a>
00:03:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h03m43s">of order, chaos and reestablishment of order
also parallels the structure of the story</a>
00:03:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h03m47s">in Genesis, the creation where human beings
are created first and exist in a paradisal</a>
00:03:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h03m52s">state.</a>
00:03:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h03m53s">That that paradise is disrupted as, as a consequence
of some, some event of virtually cosmic significance,</a>
00:03:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h04m01s">that as a consequence of that disruption people
are destined to live a profane existence in</a>
00:04:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h04m06s">constant wait for the next state of order.</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h04m18s">So just as this is a fundamental archetypical
structure so that fundamental archetypical</a>
00:04:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h04m23s">structure is, constitutes the, the basic grammar
for this story in Genesis.</a>
00:04:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h04m28s">Now what we're gonna do to begin with is to
describe precisely how this idea of paradise,</a>
00:04:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h04m35s">descent and the search for paradise is illustrated
symbolically in Genesis and exactly what those</a>
00:04:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h04m40s">symbolic representations mean.</a>
00:04:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h04m42s">The idea here being that the reason that the
authors of Genesis, the multiple authors of</a>
00:04:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h04m46s">Genesis extending over thousands and thousands
of years chose those symbols as not because</a>
00:04:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h04m52s">they were labouring to be obscure or not because
they were establishing a pre-empirical representation</a>
00:04:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h04m58s">of reality, a kind of quasi scientific representation,
but because these symbols have an elusive</a>
00:04:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h05m04s">or metaphorical richness that enables a story,
although short to be characterized by an almost</a>
00:05:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h05m10s">infinite depth.</a>
00:05:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h05m11s">That's part of the reason.</a>
00:05:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h05m12s">The other part of the reason is that when
you say something profound, you say it using</a>
00:05:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h05m17s">the language, the clearest language that you
have access to.</a>
00:05:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h05m20s">And if the story is almost unutterably profound,
then the images in which it is enshrouded</a>
00:05:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h05m26s">are almost incomprehensibly complex.</a>
00:05:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h05m30s">It has to be that way because if the target
of the investigation is reality itself, something</a>
00:05:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h05m37s">so complex that we cannot conceptualize it
fully, then the language that we use to represent</a>
00:05:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h05m43s">that reality has to stretch us to the limits
of our ability to understand</a>
00:05:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h05m47s">and it is the case that the story in Genesis
say as much as the stories of Buddhist enlightenment</a>
00:05:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h05m53s">constitutes an artistic endeavor on the part
of the human race to portray the nature of</a>
00:05:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h05m58s">human reality and to explain the behavioural
and philosophical consequences of that reality.</a>
00:05:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h06m05s">That being a tall order perhaps we should
forgive the multiple authors for only being</a>
00:06:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h06m10s">able to manage it in a way that's essentially
imagistic and dramatic, rather than explicit,</a>
00:06:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h06m16s">logical, philosophical and fully developed.</a>
00:06:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h06m20s">So the first thing I'd like to point out to
you is to, is a statement made by Eliade,</a>
00:06:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h06m26s">which I think is one of the most enlightening
things I ever read.</a>
00:06:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h06m30s">Now, the first thing that Eliade does is describe
the universality of flood mythology.</a>
00:06:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h06m35s">But then he puts a twist on it.</a>
00:06:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h06m37s">So the idea behind flood mythology is something
like this, if societies deviate from an emergent,</a>
00:06:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h06m46s">a necessarily emergent kind of morality, a
kind of morality that takes the viewpoint</a>
00:06:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h06m50s">of all the inhabitants of a given society
into account, if a society deviates from that</a>
00:06:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h06m55s">viewpoint sufficiently, it dooms itself to
annihilation.</a>
00:06:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h06m58s">That annihilation being represented mythologically
as the flooding of the society by the precosmogonic</a>
00:06:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h07m05s">waters, the primordial element or chaos.</a>
00:07:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h07m08s">So societies that are tyrannical doom themselves
to eradication by chaos, a simple equation.</a>
00:07:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h07m14s">But made more complicated by Eliade, his observation
that more than one factor plays a role in</a>
00:07:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h07m20s">the establishment of the tyranny.</a>
00:07:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h07m22s">On the one hand there's straight degeneration
of cultural presuppositions in that if you</a>
00:07:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h07m27s">establish a state or a game, which has particular

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h11m23s">So let's take a look at what Genesis says
about the creation of experience.</a>
00:11:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h11m27s">So first of all, remember we're taking a phenomenological
stance on this story, which is to say that</a>
00:11:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h11m32s">this story is not an objective retelling of,
of materialistic emergence.</a>
00:11:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h11m38s">It’s something more specifically dramatic.</a>
00:11:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h11m41s">It describes the nature of human experience.</a>
00:11:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h11m44s">Okay?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h11m45s">The nature of conscious human experience.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h11m46s">And in fact the creation story of Genesis
lays explicit stress on individual consciousness</a>
00:11:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h11m53s">literally as a precondition for being itself.</a>
00:11:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h11m56s">Which is to say that underlying the story
of Genesis is the notion that without whatever</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h12m01s">consciousness is, there would be no segregated
entities and therefore no being.</a>
00:12:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h12m06s">So this is one manner in which Genesis attempts
to put human beings at the centre of the cosmos,</a>
00:12:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h12m12s">so to speak, which is the idea that the world
independently of consciousness, whatever that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h21m44s">The idea here being that whatever experience
is in the absence of a delimited human consciousness,</a>
00:21:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h21m51s">is something that’s outside the boundaries
of time.</a>
00:21:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h21m54s">Because time -temporality is a human attribute.</a>

spatial aspects to being itself.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h22m08s">So whatever it is, is that exists without

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h22m22s">It’s something that transcends being to
such a degree that it's not even nameable</a>

00:22:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h22m32s">Now Genesis formally associates the human
being with logos.</a>
00:22:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h22m39s">And this is a determinative move in human
history just as the Mesopotamians first hypothesized</a>
00:22:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h22m46s">that their emperor was equivalent to Marduk,
the force that confronted Timat and carved</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h22m51s">her into pieces and made the world, and just
as the Egyptians conceptualized their pharaoh</a>
00:22:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h22m57s">as the intermingling between Osiris, the stability
of the state and Horus the exploratory hero.</a>
00:22:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h23m03s">And then disseminated that identity down the
aristocratic levels, closer and closer to</a>
00:23:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h23m09s">the individual, individual.</a>
00:23:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h23m11s">So the ancient Hebrews said, “and God said
let us make man in our image after our likeness.”</a>
00:23:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h23m18s">Now, it could be said that the logical derivation
of that statement is that god looks like human</a>
00:23:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h23m25s">beings.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h23m26s">Or conversely that God is an old man with
a beard.</a>
00:23:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h23m28s">But it means something I think that's more
sophisticated than that.</a>
00:23:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h23m32s">Which is that the central aspect that's associated
with this transcendent deity, the logos, which</a>
00:23:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h23m38s">is the thing that gives rise to order as a
consequence of it's confrontation with chaos</a>
00:23:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h23m43s">is also the thing that centrally characterizes
human consciousness.</a>
00:23:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h23m47s">And so with that there's this transcendent
notion that inside each human being is a spark</a>
00:23:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h23m53s">of genuine divinity.</a>
00:23:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h23m55s">And it’s the manifestation of that divinity
in human temporal and spatial parameters that</a>
00:23:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h24m00s">literally keeps the cosmos generating.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h24m13s">Male and female created he them and let them

00:24:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h24m25s">Now fundamentalist Christians read this as
an injunction, right?</a>
00:24:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h24m28s">This is what human beings should do, dominate
all other living things.</a>
00:24:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h24m32s">But it's more like a description, which is
that the consequence of the embeddedness of</a>
00:24:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h24m36s">this spark of divinity in the individual is
precisely what gave rise to the human ability</a>
00:24:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h24m42s">to dominate the planet.</a>
00:24:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h24m43s">Which is an ability that at least at the moment
seems fundamentally unparalleled, with no</a>
00:24:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h24m48s">limit in sight.</a>
00:24:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h24m50s">So it's not an injunction so much as a cold-hearted
description.</a>
00:24:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h24m54s">There's a very profound idea underlying the
necessity of the creation of the individual</a>
00:24:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h25m01s">human being.</a>
00:25:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h25m02s">Here's a line of archaic Jewish speculation
that runs something like this:</a>
00:25:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h25m07s">Why is the creation of a limited subject necessary
if God's omniscient and omnipotent and omnipresent?</a>
00:25:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h25m14s">Why would he bother creating anything outside
of himself?</a>
00:25:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h25m17s">And the line of speculation runs like this.</a>
00:25:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h25m20s">The one thing that a being that is complete
in all regards even all hypothetical regards</a>
00:25:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h25m26s">lacks by necessity his limitation.</a>
00:25:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h25m30s">And as a consequence of that anything that's
absolute is not complete and can't be complete</a>
00:25:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h25m36s">without limitation.</a>
00:25:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h25m37s">And so there's an emergent idea in Genesis.</a>
00:25:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h25m40s">And most notions of the emergence of human
consciousness that the absolute needs the</a>
00:25:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h25m45s">reflection point of a delimited being to actually
spring into some kind of defined actuality.</a>
00:25:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h25m52s">So that being itself becomes an interplay
between the necessary limitations of the finite</a>
00:25:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h25m58s">and the transcendent reality of the absolute.</a>
00:25:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h26m02s">And so being is something that emerges because
of the fact as another ancient Jewish tradition</a>
00:26:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h26m09s">has it, God and man are in a sense twins,
mutually dependent on one another for their</a>
00:26:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h26m15s">defined being.</a>
00:26:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h26m18s">From such a perspective, being has the same
nature as a game.</a>
00:26:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h26m22s">When you're playing a game you have to play
by rules.</a>
00:26:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h26m25s">Which means that there are things that you
can do while playing the game.</a>
00:26:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h26m29s">But there are many, many things you can't
do.</a>
00:26:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h26m30s">And that the game could not exist without
the limitations.</a>
00:26:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h26m34s">Also predicated on the idea that the imposition,
the Nietzschian idea that the imposition of</a>
00:26:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h26m39s">limitations on a structure actually gives
rise to the possibility of diverse new forms.</a>
00:26:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h26m45s">Which is also a very sophisticated way of
conceptualizing the world.</a>
00:26:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h26m49s">So from the perspective of Genesis, the individual
is the locale of the experiential drama.</a>
00:26:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWelXuo2JM#t=00h26m56s">And the fact that the individual is limited
is a necessary precondition for being.</a>
