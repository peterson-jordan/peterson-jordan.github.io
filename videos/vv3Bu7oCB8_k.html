00:03:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=00h03m20s">There are a number of museums like this throughout the world, and their central motto is “never forget.”</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=00h03m26s">This has always been confusing to me:</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=00h03m31s">because I don’t think you can remember something that you don’t understand.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=00h03m34s">And I don’t think we understand why the Holocaust happened in World War 2.</a>
00:03:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=00h03m40s">I think you might regard the Holocaust as an unlearned lesson.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=00h03m51s">So to say “never forget” begs the question: “what is it you’re supposed to remember?”</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=00h03m56s">Is it the fact that 6 million people were killed?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=00h04m01s">are you supposed to be giving some consideration to Holocaust-like events that have occurred through history?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=00h04m07s">Because there are people who think that what happened in World War 2 was a relatively unique event— of  something unparalleled in history.</a>
00:04:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=00h04m13s">This is not a position that I adopt.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=00h04m16s">I think, actually, it’s a very common sort of event.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=00h04m23s">It was the event of that sort that has proved most shocking to the European conscience, so to speak-</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=00h04m31s">but it hardly strikes me as unique.</a>
00:04:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=00h04m35s">People often talk about the Holocaust in terms of the relationship between the Jews and the Germans</a>
00:04:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=00h04m41s">or between the Jews and the Nazis.</a>
00:04:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=00h04m43s">The Jews obviously playing the part of victims and the Nazis often—are always--playing the part of the perpetrators.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=00h04m48s">And, of course, this is absolutely comprehensible from the historical point of view</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=00h04m51s">but it also strikes me that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=00h04m53s">if what we remember is that the Nazis killed the Jews</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=00h04m56s">then we’re already on the road to making a mistake that’s similar</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=00h05m03s">which is to identify characteristics that lead to patterns of action of that sort.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=00h05m09s">As characteristics of groups!</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=00h05m13s">And it is seems to me... I mean, I’m not try to equate the role of the Jews and the Nazis in producing the Holocaust—that would be obviously absurd.</a>
00:05:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=00h05m20s">What I’m trying to say is that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=00h05m22s">the lesson seems to me to be</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=00h05m24s">especially when you consider the propensity for Holocaust-like events is deeply rooted in human nature.</a>
00:05:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=00h05m31s">The lesson to draw from the events of World War 2 is that: that’s what human beings are like--not what the Nazis were like.</a>
00:05:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=00h05m39s">Because these sorts of events happen all the time.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=01h11m22s">What's Emotion?</a>
01:11:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=01h11m24s">Emotion is the subjective sensation that you feel</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=01h12m14s">As far as stories are concerned</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=01h12m40s">Something that has emotional significance.</a>
01:12:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=01h12m43s">See, the world of the scientific option, so to speak, 
Is devoid of emotional significance.</a>
01:12:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=01h12m47s">Really by design. Part of what you do in the scientific procedure is eradicate anything that is purely subjective like emotion.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=01h12m55s">If you think a theory is true because you like the theory then that is not sufficient grounds for considering it to be true from a scientific perspective.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=01h13m04s">You are supposed to make yourself objective. Which basically means to eradicate your emotional assessment of a given situation.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=01h13m11s">The thing is that we are always assessing situations for their affective significance.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Bu7oCB8_k#t=01h13m16s">We have to do that because emotions or affect means how to act.</a>
