<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=00h04m04s"> why people would write stories like that if they thought like we thought and I mean it really it wasn't</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h30m21s">Out I can't understand how he could possibly know these things</a>

01:30:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h30m38s">How many of you think you think in words?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h30m44s">Ok so it looks like what about pictures. How many of you think in pictures?</a>
01:30:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h30m49s">Ok so that's interesting how many of you think that's about half and half by the way probably a few err on the word side</a>
01:30:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h30m54s">How many of you think in pictures and words?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h30m58s">Ok and so alright, so it was Roughly 1/3 in each category</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h31m02s">But that's also something that I really haven't encountered any research on</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h31m23s">Almost instantaneously, but it isn't my natural mode of thinking</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h31m31s">But I know my wife isn't like that. She thinks and images and then has to translate them into words and so</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h31m37s">Anyways, you was very literate, and he could really think in words</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h32m41s">Anyways Jung could really think in images and he could imagine</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h32m56s">That's that phenomena wasn't really even even identified as a phenomena until the end of the 19th century</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h33m03s">There was a book written about it that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h33m11s">researcher about 30 years ago who started to study lucid dreams</a>
01:33:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h33m14s">But anyways, I had a client who was a lucid dreamer and one of the things she could do was</a>
01:33:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h33m19s">Ask her dream characters what</a>
01:33:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h33m22s">Information they were trying to convey and they would tell her.</a>
01:33:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h33m26s">So that was very interesting; and one of the consequences of that was I don't have this story completely right in my memory</a>
01:33:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h33m34s">But it's close enough</a>
01:33:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h33m35s">She was afraid of a very large number of things and in her dream. I think it was a gypsy</a>
01:33:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h33m42s">Standing by a wagon told her that if she was going to be successful in university</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h33m49s">that she would have to visit the slaughterhouse and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h33m53s">That was something that was way beyond her capacity of tolerate she was a vegetarian</a>
01:33:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h33m58s">she couldn't stand the sight of raw meat even and so and</a>
01:33:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h34m02s">She was very oppressed and depressed and anxious because of the slaughterhouse nature of existence and so her dream</a>
01:34:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h34m09s">focused on that and</a>
01:34:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h34m12s">One of the consequences of that because the slaughterhouse was out of the question as a clinical intervention</a>
01:34:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h34m18s">I</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h34m19s">Took her to an embalming</a>
01:34:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h34m22s">Right because because I asked her I asked her what what?</a>
01:34:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h34m26s">What might be equivalent to that and so she suggested that and you know exposure therapy is a hallmark of Clinical psychology?</a>
01:34:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h34m33s">right one of the things you do with people as a clinician is you find out what they're afraid of and</a>
01:34:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h34m39s">You gradually and voluntarily expose them to that and that cures them and that's associated with the hero myth, right?</a>
01:34:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h34m45s">It's exactly the same thing. It's like. There's a dragon</a>
01:34:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h34m48s">It's stopping you because there's lots of dragons most of them aren't stopping you. You can ignore them</a>
01:34:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h34m53s">You don't have to just go you know slash away it randomly</a>
01:34:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h34m57s">You're not supposed to be fighting dragons that aren't in your way, but if they are in your way</a>
01:34:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h35m01s">You can't ignore them and then you decompose them into sub dragons</a>
01:35:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h35m04s">And you have people you know take them on and as they take them on</a>
01:35:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h35m08s">They dispense with the dragon and they gain the power of the drag. It's like a video game</a>
01:35:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h35m13s">Actually a video game is like that. That's why people like the video games. Well, that's right, right?</a>
01:35:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h35m17s">There's a reason that you absorb power when you overcome things when you play a video game. It's not like that's</a>
01:35:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h35m24s">Intrinsic to the video game structure, that's an archetypal idea</a>
01:35:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h35m27s">Anyways, we went and saw an embalmbng which was a very interesting</a>
01:35:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h35m32s">experience and</a>
01:35:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h35m35s">quite quite useful for her because she knew what she could tolerate after that  it was a hell of a lot more than she</a>
01:35:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h35m42s">Thought she could tolerate and so that's very useful to know</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h35m46s">Back to Jung</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h35m48s">He's a visionary thinker now my client. I said she could lucid dream, and she could ask her dream</a>
01:35:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h35m57s">characters</a>
01:35:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h35m58s">What they wanted and what they were trying to communicate to her so that was pretty interesting</a>
01:35:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h36m02s">That happens spontaneously had nothing to do with me</a>
01:36:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h36m05s">I mean, I'm interested in dreams and many of my clients are great dreamers</a>
01:36:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h36m09s">Especially the creative ones because I think it's a hallmark of creativity to have vivid dreams and to be able to remember them</a>
01:36:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h36m14s">But that was a faculty that was natural to her</a>
01:36:14</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h36m22s">Had this other client at One time at one point</a>
01:36:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h36m25s">And she had a variety of fears and she had this dream that</a>
01:36:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h36m29s">She told me and she was walking down a beach</a>
01:36:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h36m32s">And on the side of the beach up a dune a small dune</a>
01:36:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h36m35s">there was this old man with a snake a big python, and there's a crowd around him and</a>
01:36:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h36m41s">she was walking by the</a>
01:36:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h36m43s">Snake handler and the snake in the crowd and she didn't want to have anything to do with them</a>
01:36:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h36m47s">he was sort of showing people the snake and</a>
01:36:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h36m50s">She told me that dream, and I thought well. You know you probably need to go see that snake</a>
01:36:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h36m55s">and so I</a>
01:36:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h36m57s">Relaxed hers quasi hypnotic technique, and it's very straightforward</a>
01:36:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h37m01s">Hypnosis is generally nothing but</a>
01:37:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h37m04s">pronounced relaxation well you have to be susceptible to hypnosis to actually fall into a hypnotic trance as a</a>
01:37:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h37m09s">Consequence of being relaxed I just relaxed her</a>
01:37:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h37m12s">I had her breathe deeply and pay attention to different parts of her body and just relax her muscles</a>
01:37:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h37m17s">One by one essentially so that she could concentrate and then I told her we play with the dream a little bit</a>
01:37:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h37m23s">It's a Jungian technique said well, so call the dream image to mind which she could do quite well said okay</a>
01:37:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h37m29s">So let's let's explore it. It's like pretend. It's like pretend play</a>
01:37:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h37m34s">You know if you're a kid in your pretend playing you don't exactly direct the game right you you play the game?</a>
01:37:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h37m41s">So it's partly your direction obviously because you're the player</a>
01:37:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h37m45s">But the thing also happens spontaneously</a>
01:37:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h37m47s">Out of its own accord and you can think about that as a dialogue between the conscious mind in the unconscious mind in some sense</a>
01:37:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h37m53s">It's a developmental dialogue. It's not a fun game. If you just direct it. It's only a fun game if</a>
01:37:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h37m59s">you're inviting and something is well as a consequence the same thing that happens when you're</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h38m12s">It's empty what you want to sort of put yourself in a receptive state of mind in an imaginative state of mind</a>
01:38:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h38m17s">And it's sort of half you in half</a>
01:38:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h38m20s">Nature itself</a>

01:38:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h38m30s">Asked her when she was in relaxed. I said well, what do you think about the snake handler and she said well?</a>
01:38:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h38m35s">He's probably a Charlatan and he's just their turn to impress the crowd and to show off and she was afraid to go up there</a>
01:38:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h38m40s">Because she thought people would push her towards the snake and she'd have to touch it</a>
01:38:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h38m43s">And so there was a fear of the crowd issue going on there too, and I said well, just look go up there</a>
01:38:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h38m49s">About do it under these conditions. Is that you know if people get pushy</a>
01:38:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h38m53s">What are you going to tell them and so we figured out something said look?</a>
01:38:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h38m57s">Just tell them that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h39m00s">look at the snake at your own pace and that you don't need any encouragement or help and it would be good if you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h39m08s">so she was afraid that the crowd would push her to do something that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h39m12s">She didn't want to do that was part of the theme of the dream</a>

01:39:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h39m18s">And went into the crowd and the crowd turned out to be quite welcoming and not hostile and not pushy</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=01h39m39s">He was just an old guy who had this snake and he was out there</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h35m00s">But it has to come from that person because one of the things that you want to find out from your client is okay</a>
02:35:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h35m06s">What's wrong?</a>
02:35:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h35m08s">they have to tell you and</a>
02:35:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h35m10s">What would not having something wrong look like like what is it if you could have what you wanted and that and that...</a>
02:35:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h35m18s">That would be good. What would that look like okay? So that establishes your star, right? It's like Geppetto</a>
02:35:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h35m24s">Establishing the relationship with the star at the beginning of pinocchio. Here's what we're aiming at</a>
02:35:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h35m28s">Okay, so now you've got that schema</a>
02:35:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h35m30s">Here's what we're aiming at</a>
02:35:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h35m31s">now you might say you might think well now that what happens to the client is they meet their dragons along the way and</a>
02:35:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h35m37s">The dragons would be well now</a>
02:35:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h35m40s">You know what you want,</a>
02:35:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h35m40s">And there are things in your way and some of those things might many of those things are going to be intensely practical</a>
02:35:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h35m47s">But they're practical/</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h35m49s">Psychological so like so maybe someone is has a job and they would like to move forward in the job</a>
02:35:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h35m54s">But they're terrified of speaking in public</a>
02:35:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h35m56s">Well, you know is that a psychological problem or a practical problem?</a>
02:35:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h35m59s">It's both</a>
02:35:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h36m00s">It's also a real problem in many positions unless you can speak fluently</a>
02:36:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h36m04s">Publicly you're you're going to hit a ceiling and you're not going to go anywhere and so</a>
02:36:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h36m10s">For the person to move towards that goal</a>
02:36:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h36m14s">Then they have to confront the obstacles that manifest themselves</a>
02:36:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h36m18s">Within that framework and part of your job as a clinician is to identify the obstacles</a>
02:36:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h36m23s">And to discriminate them from things they don't have to worry about right part of it is</a>
02:36:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h36m28s">you know you can't just run around and try to</a>
02:36:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h36m31s">Combat all the Chaos in the world some of it is your Chaos and a bunch of it isn't and the Chaos</a>
02:36:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h36m37s">That's yours is the Chaos that emerges as you move towards a necessary goal</a>
02:36:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h36m41s">And so partly what you're doing by listening to your client is to help them cut their dragons down to size</a>
02:36:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h36m46s">You know because what will happen if you start to talk to somebody about public speaking and you really talk to them</a>
02:36:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h36m51s">Is that you decompose the problem into a set of maybe 20 subproblems like well</a>
02:36:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h36m57s">Do you know exactly how to give a speech? What's your theory of</a>
02:36:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h37m02s">Public speaking? Do you know how to look at people when you're talking? Do you know how to speak loudly enough?</a>
02:37:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h37m07s">so that people can hear you? do you have a philosophy of</a>
02:37:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h37m11s">Public speaking? you know all those things are necessary in order to do it properly you need to decompose that with the client and then to</a>
02:37:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h37m17s">Make those problems you have to decompose them to the point where they can be met by a practical solution</a>
02:37:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h37m23s">and then you have to guide the person through the implementation of the practical solution and</a>
02:37:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h37m30s">Mostly you do that by by listening</a>
02:37:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h37m32s">It's like the what you need to be is the person who helps the person</a>
02:37:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h37m36s">That you're working with orient themselves towards a better future</a>
02:37:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h37m39s">That's the compact you and I are in this space at this time to make things better</a>
02:37:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h37m45s">first of all we have to decide what better would look like and</a>
02:37:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h37m49s">Second we need a strategy and third</a>
02:37:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h37m51s">we need to</a>
02:37:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h37m52s">Once we have that we're going to see the obstacles and some of those are going to be</a>
02:37:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h37m55s">Psychological and some of them are going to be practical and we're going to engage in joint</a>
02:37:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h37m59s">problem-solving of whatever, sort is necessary in order to</a>
02:37:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h38m04s">Minimize the impact of those problems or to gain from the problems and dream analysis can be extremely useful for that by the way</a>
02:38:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h38m11s">It's even more useful for helping the person identify what the goal is because that's often difficult for people. It's like well</a>
02:38:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h38m17s">I know that something's wrong</a>
02:38:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h38m18s">But I don't know what I want. sometimes people get so stuck there that they just can't get they just can't get out of it</a>
02:38:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h38m25s">So and then what would you watch out for?</a>
02:38:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h38m29s">"Phenomenologically. The way it shows up, The way, It's experienced"</a>
02:38:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h38m34s">Well, I would say the clinician one of the things that you should watch out for is resentment</a>
02:38:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h38m39s">So there's a there's a couple of rules of thumb that I think are useful</a>
02:38:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h38m43s">Don't do anything for your clients that they can do for themselves and don't do them any favors?</a>
02:38:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h38m48s">Now I think you can step</a>
02:38:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h38m51s">Beyond the confines of your role</a>
02:38:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h38m55s">carefully now and then</a>
02:38:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h38m59s">to show that</a>
02:38:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h39m01s">There's there's there's a more human connection than the merely contractual. I think that's very useful but</a>
02:39:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h39m09s">Their problems are not your problems you do not have any right to their problems</a>
02:39:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h39m12s">And so you have to maintain that detachment because otherwise you can steal their destiny</a>
02:39:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h39m17s">You don't want to be the person that solves their problems because you steal their destiny when you do that</a>
02:39:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h39m22s">You want to be someone with whom they can figure things out for themselves?</a>
02:39:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h39m26s">And so there can be hubris in being a clinician because you can be the problem solver and that elevates you to a position</a>
02:39:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h39m32s">You elevate yourself to that position. You'll fall flat on your face</a>
02:39:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h39m35s">You'll hurt your clients and things will kick back on you very very hard because what the hell. Do you know?</a>
02:39:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h39m41s">right</a>
02:39:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h39m42s">Nothing because that person is very complicated and they need to they need to sort themselves out and but you can be a facilitator</a>
02:39:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h39m49s">For that, but that's all you should be</a>
02:39:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h39m52s">And so you have to watch that you have to watch over</a>
02:39:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h39m55s">becoming over and k over ly entangled so you have to maintain your detachment in the best sense, and you have to not overstep your</a>
02:39:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h40m02s">It's easy to become hubristic when the person is looking to you for the answers</a>
02:40:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h40m07s">It's like you might you don't have the answers although you might be able to find help the person find their way</a>
02:40:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h40m13s">That's what you do with everyone. You love - right?</a>
02:40:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h40m16s">I mean, you don't provide them with the answers because then they become little clones of you and</a>
02:40:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h40m23s">unhappy bitter resentful and Angry little clones of you because you usurped their destiny and</a>
02:40:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h40m30s">so</a>
02:40:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoQdp2prfmM#t=02h40m32s">the same thing applies within familiar Arrangements or friendships all about it, </a>
