<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h00m21s">And the classic answer is something like 4 to 6 hours a day, from an ineffective study.</a>

00:00:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h00m40s">It's a hundred hours a month. This is two and a half weeks of complete work.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h01m35s">The best thing you can do is teach people to write, because there is no difference between that and thinking and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h01m40s">One of the things that puzzles me about universities is that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h01m44s">Nobody tells students why they should write something</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h01m51s">It's good that you have to do the job, well, why do you write? Well, you need the grades, really not</a>
00:01:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h01m58s">You have to learn to think</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h02m39s">Rather, if you clarify your point of view and they will clarify their point of view, it is better if you have yours</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h02m44s">Tightly organized, because otherwise, you'd look like a total idiot</a>

00:03:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h03m14s">The first thing people do wrong is when they say OK, I don't like to follow a schedule</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h03m17s">If okay, what kind of schedule are you setting up.</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h03m20s">Well I have to do this, then I have to do this, and I have to do this, you know</a>
00:03:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h03m24s">Then I go play video games because whoever wants to do all these things I have to do !? This is a mistake</a>
00:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h03m29s">Set your schedule</a>

00:03:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h03m35s">I have a tomorrow, if I were to set it up so that it would be the best day I could have.</a>
00:03:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h03m41s">In practical terms, what would it look like?</a>
00:03:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h03m44s">Well then you schedule that, and obviously there's a little bit of responsibility that's worth pursuing because if you have any sense</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h03m50s">One of the things you insist on is that at the end of the day?</a>
00:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h03m54s">You are not in a worse situation than you were at the start of the day, because if that is the case then it is a stupid day</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h04m00s">If you have a bunch of these (stupid) days in a row and over again, you're actually digging, you know.</a>
00:04:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h04m02s">Dig a hole and burn yourself in - sorry - that's not a good strategy. It is a bad strategy</a>
00:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h04m09s">So maybe</a>
00:04:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h04m10s">20% of your day should have responsibilities and duties</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h04m13s">Or maybe more than that depends on how short you are. But you can even ask yourself, okay?</a>
00:04:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h04m19s">Well, I have these responsibilities.</a>
00:04:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h04m21s">I have to schedule those things in what is the correct ratio of</a>
00:04:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h04m25s">Responsibility to reward. And you can just ask yourself as if you were negotiating with someone who works for you</a>
00:04:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h04m30s">Well, you should work tomorrow</a>
00:04:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h04m32s">Well I want you to work tomorrow and you might say OK. Well, what will you do for me?</a>
00:04:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h04m37s">What makes me likely I will work for you? Well you can ask yourself, maybe you can do an hour of</a>
00:04:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h04m44s">Responsibility and then play a video game for 15 minutes.</a>
00:04:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h04m47s">I don't know anything of your interest and enthusiasm, but you know</a>
00:04:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h04m49s">You have to negotiate with yourself and not be tyrannical</a>
00:04:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h04m54s">As if you were negotiating with someone you care for, you want to be productive and have a good life</a>
00:04:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h04m59s">And this is how you define the schedule</a>
00:04:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h05m01s">So you look at today and think well, if I had that day, that would be fine</a>
00:05:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h05m05s">Great, you know yourself that you are useless and industrious, so you probably get to about seventy percent accuracy</a>
00:05:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h05m11s">But it is much better than zero percent.</a>
00:05:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h05m13s">Is it like that? And if I got to</a>
00:05:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h05m15s">Even with fifty percent accuracy, well set a goal in front of you so that you reach fifty-one percent in the next week or 50 and a half</a>
00:05:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h05m21s">Percent for God or l</a>
00:05:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h05m24s">You will get to this position where things start to repeat</a>
00:05:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h05m28s">Positively and moving you up.</a>
00:05:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h05m33s">Well, and if we all worked together collectively and stop making things worse because that's another thing people do all the time.</a>
00:05:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h05m41s">Not just that they aren't doing what needs to be done to make things better, but rather</a>
00:05:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h05m43s">They actively try to make things worse because they are spiteful, upset, arrogant, delusional, or</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h05m50s">Or wanting genocide, or all of these things together</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h05m55s">Grouped together in one psychological package. So people were really really starting to try to stop making things worse</a>
00:05:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h06m03s">We have no idea how much they will get just because of that</a>
00:06:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h06m06s">So this strange dynamic is part of the existential system of ideas among human weakness</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNzAuYDgy0#t=00h06m13s">Social judgment is both from them</a>
