00:00:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h00m06s">So we’re going to talk about the brain today.</a>
00:00:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h00m14s">Last lecture I talked to you a little bit
about construct validation and what it means</a>
00:00:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h00m19s">to measure something and so, we’re going
to take a bit of a detour.</a>
00:00:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h00m25s">So I told you about measurement problems last
time.</a>
00:00:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h00m32s">If you do your measurement properly in psychometrics—if
you’re studying personality, if you’re</a>
00:00:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h00m37s">studying individual differences—there are
roughly six things that you can discover and</a>
00:00:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h00m43s">they can be broken up different ways.</a>
00:00:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h00m47s">That’s the big five model: extraversion,
neuroticism, agreeableness, contentiousness,</a>
00:00:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h00m53s">openness, and they can be subdivided as you
should know because, in principle, you’ve</a>
00:00:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h00m57s">read the paper that subdivided them into ten.</a>
00:00:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h01m01s">That turns out to be quite useful, but for
now we’ll just presume that there are five,</a>
00:01:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h01m06s">and then the other factor of human function
that’s pretty easy to derive and measure</a>
00:01:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h01m12s">is IQ.</a>
00:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h01m14s">Now, IQ likely nests under openness because
openness looks like it’s something roughly</a>
00:01:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h01m20s">like intellect which is interest in ideas,
but—that’s probably an ability with ideas—but</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h01m25s">that’s probably measured better by an IQ
test, so if I ask you how smart you are and</a>
00:01:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h01m30s">you say you’re pretty smart that would give
you a relatively high score on the intellect</a>
00:01:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h01m33s">scale, but if I tested your IQ I will get
a better measure than that so in some sense</a>
00:01:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h01m38s">IQ nests inside the big five model.</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h01m41s">But you can think about it as a separate thing
and I think it’s reasonable to do that so,</a>
00:01:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h01m45s">you know, it depends on what you’re up to
fundamentally.</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h01m50s">Now, when the big five was first invented—invented
or discovered, depending on how you look at</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h01m56s">it—as I mentioned briefly, as well, it was
brute force statistics basically, so the idea</a>
00:01:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h02m02s">behind the big five is that the—it’s called
the lexical hypothesis—and the lexical hypothesis</a>
00:02:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h02m08s">is that, because human traits are so important
to us because we want to understand ourselves</a>
00:02:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h02m15s">and, perhaps even more importantly, we want
to understand other people, and because we</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h02m19s">have language, there’s a reasonable probability
that we’ve encapsulated the structure of</a>
00:02:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h02m25s">human personality within our language.</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h02m28s">And so, if you analyze the linguistic representations
properly, then perhaps you can extract out</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h02m35s">the central personality features, and that’s
basically what the lexical hypothesis is.</a>
00:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h02m40s">And it’s important to know the lexical hypotheses.</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h02m42s">And it’s a bit more sophisticated than that
because it basically presumes that you can</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h02m49s">extract out relevant information about personality
from adjectives—descriptive adjectives—from</a>
00:02:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h02m55s">phrases and from questions, and you’ll get
the same basic dimensional structure regardless</a>
00:02:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h03m02s">of which of those techniques you use.</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h03m04s">And that turns out to be true for all intents
and purposes.</a>
00:03:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h03m11s">Now, the lexical hypothesis depends on its
validity, depends for its validity on the</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h03m17s">initial claim that personality is accurately
represented within the structure of language.</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h03m21s">And so one of the things I would say is that
there’s a weak big five hypothesis and a</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h03m28s">strong big five hypothesis, okay?</a>
00:03:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h03m30s">The weak big five hypothesis is that, insofar
as you use language to describe personality,</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h03m38s">personality has a five factor structure that’s
reliably extractable.</a>
00:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h03m40s">Now the strong big five theory is that, no
no, personality has a five factor structure,</a>
00:03:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h03m48s">and it’s accurately represented in language,
but when you pull out the structure from language,</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h03m52s">what you’re pulling out is actually representative
of genuine personality.</a>
00:03:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h03m59s">Now, the weak hypothesis, I would say, is
established.</a>
00:03:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h04m04s">And it’s worth knowing because what it means
is that if you invent a questionnaire that</a>
00:04:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h04m10s">has anything to do with self description,
it might be self description at multiple different</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h04m14s">levels of analysis, like values for example,
instead of just adjectives, or attitudes instead</a>
00:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h04m22s">of just adjectives, I mean, these categories
are sort of unclear.</a>
00:04:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h04m26s">What’s the difference between your attitude
and your temperament?</a>
00:04:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h04m31s">Well, it’s usually defined by the sentence
that you use the words in, right, you extract</a>
00:04:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h04m35s">out the words, they sort of stand there alone—it’
s very difficult to clarify their meaning.</a>
00:04:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h04m41s">Anyways, the lexical hypothesis I think is
one of the most well established—it’s</a>
00:04:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h04m50s">one of the most well-validated claims in psychology.</a>
00:04:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h04m53s">I think it may be the most validated claim,
apart from maybe the work that has extracted</a>
00:04:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h04m58s">IQ out from cognitive questions.</a>
00:04:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h05m02s">And basically it was brute force statistics,
you know, people developed different lists</a>
00:05:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h05m09s">of adjectives and you can complain in some
ways about how they did it, and we’ll talk</a>
00:05:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h05m13s">about that a bit later, but, because they
tried to throw out evaluative words like good</a>
00:05:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h05m17s">and evil for example—those aren’t in the
big five—so they tried to only use adjectives</a>
00:05:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h05m23s">that didn’t necessarily seem to be, like,
valued or devalued.</a>
00:05:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h05m30s">So introvert and extrovert, well, they’re
opposites, but is it better to be an introvert?</a>
00:05:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h05m34s">Is it better to be an extravert?</a>
00:05:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h05m37s">Well, it’s not obvious so all the words
that cover that dimension can be kept in because</a>
00:05:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h05m43s">there’s no value judgments associated with
it and the originators of the big five theory</a>
00:05:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h05m47s">wanted to keep it as free of values as possible.</a>
00:05:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h05m51s">Now that’s already a hypothesis right?</a>
00:05:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h05m53s">It’s a hypothesis that you can come up with
an accurate description of human personality</a>
00:05:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h05m58s">even if you eliminate all the words that are
clearly valenced.</a>
00:05:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h06m03s">And we did an experiment here a while back
that was pretty interesting.</a>
00:06:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h06m07s">We got hold of a data set of descriptive adjectives
and we put all the evaluative words back in.</a>
00:06:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h06m13s">So, like nasty and horrible and awkward and
cruel, and then the good words as well: moral,</a>
00:06:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h06m22s">pleasant, uplifting, all those things.</a>
00:06:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h06m26s">And then we had people rate people they liked
and people they didn’t like using that expanded</a>
00:06:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h06m30s">list and we got a real archetype in some sense
of the hateable person and a tremendous number</a>
00:06:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h06m36s">of the words that were used came from the
evaluative dimension.</a>
00:06:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h06m40s">So I think that when you throw out the evaluative
words you actually throw out a lot of what</a>
00:06:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h06m44s">people actually use, descriptive words to

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h06m55s">I mean, you hang around the people you like
generally speaking and you don’t associate</a>

a fundamental choice.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h07m02s">But we’ll talk about that later because
there’s reasons that happened and the reasons</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h07m08s">were valid, and it’s not that easy to fix
it.</a>
00:07:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h07m12s">And besides that, the standard five factor
model has all sorts of utility.</a>
00:07:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h07m16s">But you need to know what its strengths are
and its limitations are.</a>
00:07:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h07m20s">Now, hypothetically, what you do to draw out
the five factor model was you take, imagine</a>
00:07:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h07m25s">a set of all descriptive adjectives, okay,
and then you take a random sample of those</a>
00:07:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h07m31s">descriptive adjectives, so that it’s not
biased—you’re not going to use all of</a>
00:07:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h07m35s">them because, you know, if you asked someone
to describe themselves on a questionnaire</a>
00:07:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h07m39s">using all the adjectives we have to describe
personality they’d be there for like a day.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h07m44s">And so that’s not every efficient.</a>
00:07:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h07m45s">And so you want to take a random sample.</a>
00:07:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h07m48s">Maybe you only sample the words that people
are most likely to use.</a>
00:07:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h07m52s">So for example if you go online you’ll find
that there are word frequency tables.</a>
00:07:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h07m56s">You know, most of your language, about 500
words covers about 80% of what you say.</a>
00:07:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h08m04s">You know, and I don’t remember what the
lexicon of the typical person is, I think</a>
00:08:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h08m09s">it’s in the neighbourhood of 3500 words,
but that might be wrong, but there’s like</a>
00:08:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h08m15s">750,000 words in the English language.</a>
00:08:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h08m17s">It’s an omnivorous language, it just pulls
words in from all over.</a>
00:08:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h08m21s">And so we hardly use any of those words, and
you know, there’s ones that are used extraordinarily</a>
00:08:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h08m27s">infrequently.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h08m28s">So what you could do is you could look at
the total set of adjectives and then you could</a>
00:08:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h08m32s">pull out, you know, identify the ones that
are used,, you know, the thousand most frequently</a>
00:08:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h08m38s">used words and that’d probably cover 95%
of the territory, and then you can pick out</a>
00:08:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h08m42s">a random set of 100.</a>
00:08:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h08m44s">Then you could administer it to people, and
then you could factor analyze it—you’d</a>
00:08:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h08m48s">administer it to lots of people—then you
factor analyze it and you get five relatively</a>
00:08:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h08m52s">clear and stable factors.</a>
00:08:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h08m54s">And the one that comes out first, it’s the
dominant factor in some sense, or the easiest</a>
00:08:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h09m01s">measure or maybe the best represented in language
or something like that, it’s extraversion</a>
00:09:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h09m05s">versus introversion.</a>
00:09:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h09m07s">And the extraversion is a positive emotion
dimension.</a>
00:09:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h09m12s">And it’s associated with enthusiasm and
assertiveness.</a>
00:09:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h09m20s">And assertive people will say, they’ll dominate
the conversation with language.</a>
00:09:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h09m24s">Or, well basically that’s the way to think
about it.</a>
00:09:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h09m28s">Enthusiastic people, they’re up for anything,
you know, they’re the ones they’re always</a>
00:09:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h09m31s">smiling and telling jokes and having parties
and that sort of thing.</a>
00:09:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h09m33s">And generally extroverts really like to be
around people.</a>
00:09:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h09m38s">So they’re happy, they’re gregarious,
they’re assertive, they’re enthusiastic,</a>
00:09:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h09m42s">they’re noisy, they blink more than introverts—now
why that is I have no idea, but apparently</a>
00:09:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h09m47s">they do [student laughter].</a>
00:09:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h09m48s">So if you notice someone blinking a lot you
can assume that they’re extroverts.</a>
00:09:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h09m55s">If they’re not conscientious , you know
there’s this idea of people being impulsive,</a>
00:09:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h09m59s">it’s a very badly defined term so when you
hear a psychologist talking about impulsivity</a>
00:09:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h10m04s">the first think you could realize is they
don’t know, you don’t know what they’re</a>
00:10:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h10m07s">talking about because probably there’s no
such thing as impulsivity.</a>
00:10:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h10m11s">But extraverted people who are not very conscientious
tend to--that's one of the things you might</a>
00:10:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h10m19s">think about as associated with impulsivity.</a>
00:10:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h10m21s">There's all sorts of other things though to,
so--okay there's a positive emption dimension</a>
00:10:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h10m26s">and that's extraversion and there's a negative
emotion dimension and that's neuroticism.</a>
00:10:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h10m32s">And neuroticism seems to break down into something
like withdrawal and volatility.</a>
00:10:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h10m36s">And volatile people are touchy.</a>
00:10:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h10m38s">So, you know, they'll react quite a lot if
something negative happens.</a>
00:10:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h10m42s">So if you tease them they might get upset
or if you start fighting with them in a sort</a>
00:10:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h10m46s">of provocative way instead of sort of calming
everything down, they'll just ramp it up.</a>
00:10:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h10m51s">And if there's two of you that're volatile
and you're having a conversation and the conversation</a>
00:10:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h10m55s">goes a little bit, you know, into unpleasant
territory, you can really get each other going.</a>
00:10:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h11m00s">So, yes?</a>
00:11:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h11m01s">Student: "Is it like, in terms of the hero,
like internal states?"</a>
00:11:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h11m07s">Both.</a>
00:11:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h11m08s">Both, yeah.</a>
00:11:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h11m09s">I mean, that's part of the problem with using
the word emotion because, you know, is an</a>
00:11:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h11m11s">emotion an internal state or a set of behaviours,
and the answer to that is, as far as we can</a>
00:11:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h11m16s">tell it's both.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h11m17s">So now, I'm going to start talking about extraversion
and neuroticism, and part of the reason for</a>
00:11:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h11m25s">that is because I think the evidence for the
relationship between those traits and the</a>
00:11:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h11m30s">way the brain functions is, in some sense,
the clearest.</a>
00:11:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h11m34s">Now, you remember the big five were extracted
out using statistical procedures, right, so</a>
00:11:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h11m40s">there's no reason to assume necessarily that
the traits would bear any straightforward</a>
00:11:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h11m45s">relationship to brain function.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h11m48s">Because they weren't derived from analysis
of brain function.</a>
00:11:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h11m52s">At least not directly.</a>
00:11:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h11m54s">They were extracted from analysis of linguistic
representations of other people's and your</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h12m00s">But it turns out that there's quite a concordance
between certain elements of neuropsychological</a>
00:12:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h12m06s">theory and the positive and negative emotional
traits: extraversion and neuroticism.</a>
00:12:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h12m13s">And so what I'm going to do today is, I'm
going to talk to you about how positive and</a>
00:12:13</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h12m26s">But I'm going to put that in a broader picture
of brain function because, well first of all,</a>
00:12:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h12m33s">why not?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h12m34s">And second because a lot of the things I'm
going to tell you about the brain today will</a>
00:12:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h12m37s">sort of retroactively shed light on some of
the clinical theories we've already talked</a>
00:12:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h12m42s">about.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h12m43s">So, which is nice, you know, because, one
of the ways you find out if something is true,</a>
00:12:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h12m48s">and this is something we also talked about
during the last lecture, is that it manifests</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h12m53s">itself even when you use different measurement
techniques.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h12m57s">And so you have statistical derivation, you
know, which basically took place, it really</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h13m02s">started to accelerate I would say, first in
the 1960s and then in the 1980s--it made a</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h13m07s">big comeback in the 1980s.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h13m09s">But paralleling that were theories of brain
development.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h13m11s">And they weren't really--the scientists that
were doing the one sort of research weren't</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h13m19s">So they were methodologically separate.</a>
00:13:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h13m20s">They used different techniques as well.</a>
00:13:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h13m22s">They weren't talking back and forth much and
they were using different measurement techniques.</a>
00:13:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h13m27s">So if they both come up with the same thing
then you think, oh well there's probably something</a>
00:13:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h13m31s">to that because, you know, the sighted people
discovered it and the people who could hear</a>
00:13:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h13m37s">discovered it.</a>
00:13:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h13m38s">It's the same kind of idea.</a>
00:13:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h13m40s">So, and you know, this has been worked out
in a fair bit of detail over the last 30 years</a>
00:13:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h13m49s">really.</a>
00:13:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h13m50s">And so the papers that you're supposed to
read with this, they're difficult papers.</a>
00:13:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h13m56s">I believe you're reading Grey, which is a
model of the limbic system and basal ganglia,</a>
00:13:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h14m00s">applications to anxiety and schizophrenia.</a>
00:14:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h14m03s">And I think you have goals and behaviour,
that's the Carver&amp;Scheier paper.</a>
00:14:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h14m09s">I put the Swanson paper in as optional.</a>
00:14:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h14m12s">That's cerebral hemisphere regulation and
motivated behaviour.</a>
00:14:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h14m14s">That is a tough paper.</a>
00:14:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h14m16s">And so is the Grey paper.</a>
00:14:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h14m18s">And it's partly because these guys, both of
them, Grey's paper is a distillation of a</a>
00:14:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h14m25s">very very thick book that's very very difficult.</a>
00:14:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h14m28s">And that's been written twice.</a>
00:14:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h14m29s">It was published first in 1982 and then again
in 1999.</a>
00:14:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h14m32s">It's a brilliant book.</a>
00:14:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h14m34s">It's had a tremendous impact on psychology.</a>
00:14:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h14m36s">Grey was one of those people who, he was so
damned smart it was just painful.</a>
00:14:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h14m41s">His reference list--I don't know how many
papers are in his reference list.</a>
00:14:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h14m45s">Like 2,000.</a>
00:14:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h14m46s">And one of the really weird things about Grey
that makes him stand out among scientists</a>
00:14:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h14m49s">is, he actually read all those papers.</a>
00:14:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h14m51s">And more than that, he understood them.</a>
00:14:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h14m54s">And so that's really something.</a>
00:14:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h14m55s">And so Grey's book on anxiety--he did a lot
of work on animal behaviour and, I'll tell</a>
00:14:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h15m03s">you, if you want solid psychological information
about how the brain works, the people you</a>
00:15:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h15m09s">pay attention to are the people who are studying
animal behaviour and animal brains.</a>
00:15:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h15m16s">They know what they're doing.</a>
00:15:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h15m17s">They're so methodologically careful.</a>
00:15:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h15m19s">They're very very reliable.</a>
00:15:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h15m21s">And the human neuropsychologists and the people
that use PET scanners and MRIs and all those</a>
00:15:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h15m25s">things, they're way way way behind the animal
researchers.</a>
00:15:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h15m28s">Because the animal researchers can just get
in there at a lot higher resolution and they</a>
00:15:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h15m32s">can do much more stringent experiments.</a>
00:15:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h15m34s">And they tend to be more methodologically
careful and more scientifically-minded.</a>
00:15:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h15m39s">So anyways, the Grey book is a brilliant book.</a>
00:15:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h15m42s">It took me like four months to read that damn
book.</a>
00:15:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h15m45s">And I mean I really had to take it apart because
he probably poured 30 years of work into it,</a>
00:15:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h15m52s">something like that.</a>
00:15:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h15m54s">He worked a lot in 30 years.</a>
00:15:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h15m55s">You know?</a>
00:15:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h15m56s">He did a lot of experimentation and he read
a lot and so he built a model of the brain's</a>
00:15:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h16m00s">function that was based partly on Russian
neuropsychology, partly on cybernetic theory,</a>
00:16:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h16m07s">partly on animal behaviour, partly on neuropsychopharmacology,
and so that's the study of how drugs affect</a>
00:16:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h16m13s">behaviour and cognition, and then partly from
a higher order conceptual perspective.</a>
00:16:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h16m19s">And then he stacked all those things up, one
on top of the other, to make sure that the</a>
00:16:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h16m23s">picture was the same at every single level
of analysis.</a>
00:16:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h16m26s">It's absolutely brilliant work and it took
the social psychologists like--they really</a>
00:16:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h16m31s">started about Grey, although he published
his book in 1982--they probably started thinking</a>
00:16:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h16m36s">Grey seriously in about 2005.</a>
00:16:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h16m37s">So it took 23 years for his book to start
to make its wide-scale entrance in the more</a>
00:16:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h16m45s">general psychological community.</a>
00:16:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h16m48s">Anyways, and so you're going to read this
paper which is a model of the limbic system</a>
00:16:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h16m52s">and basal ganglia.</a>
00:16:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h16m54s">And 30 years were distilled into the book
and then that was distilled into this paper.</a>
00:16:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h16m59s">So you know, it's rough going.</a>
00:16:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h17m02s">And then the Swanson paper, he's another guy--same
kind of guy--he's a developmental neuroanatomist</a>
00:17:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h17m08s">and if you're really interested in psychology
I would really recommend reading those papers</a>
00:17:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h17m13s">because they're hard going, but if you get
it, you have this substrata of knowledge underneath</a>
00:17:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h17m19s">you that's really firm.</a>
00:17:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h17m21s">And I really like Swanson's paper--the guy's
a genius.</a>
00:17:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h17m24s">And what's so cool about Swanson's paper is
that, if you talk to human neuropsychologists</a>
00:17:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h17m29s">you'll find that they're biased toward the
cerebral cortex.</a>
00:17:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h17m33s">And they're sort of, I think there's sort
of an anthropomorphic pride that goes along</a>
00:17:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h17m36s">with that.</a>
00:17:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h17m37s">It's like, well how are we different from
animals.</a>
00:17:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h17m39s">Well, you know, we've got thumbs and that's
great--hurray for the thumbs--and we stand</a>
00:17:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h17m43s">upright, but if you look at us neurologically
the big difference is that we have this tremendously</a>
00:17:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h17m47s">expanded cerebral cortex, especially the prefrontal
cortex, and so then people think--well because,</a>
00:17:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h17m53s">you know, because that's one of the things
that differentiates us from animals and it's</a>
00:17:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h17m57s">relatively evolutionarily modern, because
the human brain really really developed rapidly</a>
00:17:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h18m02s">over the last two million years, that it's
like king of the brain in some sense.</a>
00:18:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h18m08s">And it's the place where all the complicated
things happen.</a>
00:18:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h18m12s">And that's just not right, because like, breathing--that's
complicated.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h18m17s">That's why you don't get to control it voluntarily.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h18m19s">And keeping your heart going, that's complicated
too, and so you don't get to have a decision</a>
00:18:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h18m24s">about that.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h18m27s">Like millions of years ago because there's
just no way you're going to get voluntary</a>

do more complex things, in some ways I think</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h18m40s">that's actually precisely backwards.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h18m42s">It's the old brain areas that've been around
for, you know, a hundred million years, those</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h19m18s">It's like people think of the brain.</a>
00:19:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h19m19s">Well, they have a dopey model.</a>
00:19:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h19m21s">Use a rat as an example, of course it's off
in some ways because rats can't talk for example,</a>
00:19:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h19m27s">but there are so many levels of analysis where
you might as well be a rat, you know?</a>
00:19:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h19m34s">Technically speaking.</a>
00:19:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h19m35s">The pharmacology for example is very very
similar.</a>
00:19:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h19m38s">The function of the neurotransmitters, the
basic anatomy of the structures.</a>
00:19:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h19m43s">There's a tremendous amount of overlap.</a>
00:19:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h19m46s">And so you might as well go for the commonalities
among brains before you focus in on the differences,</a>
00:19:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h19m52s">because in some sense that way you get the
basic architecture right.</a>
00:19:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h19m56s">Now one of the things that's really interesting
about Swanson, and he's not a neuropsychologist</a>
00:19:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h20m02s">and he's not really even a psychologist--he's
a developmental neuroanatomist.</a>
00:20:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h20m07s">And so, there's lots of ways of chopping up
the brain, you know, to look at it, because</a>
00:20:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h20m12s">it's a really complicated thing.</a>
00:20:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h20m14s">It's like saying, well how many ways can you
divide up a city to analyze it.</a>
00:20:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h20m19s">Well, there's endless number of ways that
you can divide up a city to look at it.</a>
00:20:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h20m25s">It's the same with the brain because it's
infinitely subdividable, in some sense, certainly</a>
00:20:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h20m31s">all the way down to the molecular structures.</a>
00:20:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h20m33s">And then even at higher order levels, you
know, because it's so complex and it's hierarchically</a>
00:20:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h20m38s">structured you can just divide it up in all
sorts of different ways and so, at higher</a>
00:20:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h20m43s">levels of resolution there isn't even that
much agreement on how to name the parts.</a>
00:20:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h20m48s">Now, what the developmental neuroanatomists
do is that they look at how the brain develops</a>
00:20:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h20m53s">in utero over time.</a>
00:20:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h20m55s">Because it's a developing thing that sort
of unfolds like a flower unfolds, you know?</a>
00:20:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h20m59s">And you can track which part of the early
brain turns into the later brain and you can</a>
00:20:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h21m05s">get some sense of the--it's like an evolutionary
tree you know?</a>
00:21:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h21m10s">If these three parts grew out of this part
then you can assume that there's some commonality</a>
00:21:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h21m15s">between them.</a>
00:21:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h21m16s">And that can also help you figure out how
to divide up the brain.</a>
00:21:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h21m19s">And so that's one of the things that Swanson
does.</a>
00:21:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h21m21s">But the other thing he does that I really
like is that, instead of looking at the brain</a>
00:21:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h21m25s">from top down which is what human neuropsychologists
tend to do because they concentrate on say</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h21m30s">language and higher order cognitive functions,
which we think of as complex but you think,</a>
00:21:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h21m36s">they're not that damn complex, you know, like
a computer can do mathematics so much better</a>
00:21:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h21m42s">than you that there's not even any comparison,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h21m45s">And it won't be very long before a lot of
the things that we think of as abstract cognition</a>
00:21:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h21m50s">are things that computers are going to be
able to do.</a>
00:21:50</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h21m55s">And the computers are now better--even your

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h22m06s">And so computers are catching up damn fast,
but you'll notice that they don't do things</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h22m09s">like bus tables in restaurants, because it

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h22m51s">Now, what Swanson did with the nervous system--I
was so happy when I found this paper because--he</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h22m57s">did exactly with the nervous system what Piaget
did with children.</a>
00:22:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h23m01s">He showed how the nervous system builds itself

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h23m05s">And so Swanson lays right on top of Piaget--it's

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h23m10s">And then the other thing that Swanson does
very very nicely is, he elucidates a lot of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h25m31s">Now, what Swanson did--you know how Piaget
talked about children/infants, they start</a>
00:25:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h25m36s">out with a few fundamental reflexes, right,
that they're sort of born with, including</a>
00:25:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h25m41s">the ability to use their mouth and their tongue
as an exploratory device.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h25m47s">And then they have certain reflexes that they
can manifest right away, and then they have</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h25m50s">the ability to modify those reflexes.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h25m53s">And so, as far as Piaget was concerned, that
was enough to get the ball rolling.</a>
00:25:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h25m56s">It was sort of like the child was like booting
up across time.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h26m12s">Well that's sort of what human beings do across
time.</a>
00:26:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h26m14s">They start out with these basic reflexes that
are simple movements and then they earn how</a>

how to chain the movements together and then</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h26m23s">they learn how to use the chained movements
as tools, in some sense, as embodied tools,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h27m08s">What happens is your orient yourself to a

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h28m31s">All I have to do is point the lecture in the

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h28m43s">They're primed in some sense.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h28m45s">And so, Swanson helped me understand the functions
of the lower part of the brain quite well</a>
00:28:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h28m52s">and then to map that onto Piaget.</a>
00:28:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h28m53s">And one of the things he helped me understand
was just exactly how sophisticated the lower</a>
00:28:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h28m59s">parts of the brain are, the more automatic
parts.</a>
00:28:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h29m02s">Now, the behaviourists used to believe that,
or did believe and still believe to some degree,</a>
00:29:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h29m07s">that a lot of your behaviour is reflexive.</a>
00:29:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h29m10s">And the radical behaviourists, the guys from
the 50s, more or less made that case that</a>
00:29:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h29m15s">even complex behaviour among animals is nothing
but the chaining together of automatic reflexes.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h29m21s">So it was a deterministic chain of reflexes.</a>
00:29:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h29m24s">Well, you do have reflex actions, you know,
so if you touch a hot stove you'll jerk your</a>

that--it's just your spinal cord that's involved</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h29m35s">Now, your brain is involved when the pain
hits, and maybe that's so you stop doing it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h29m39s">in the future, but the conscious part of your

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h29m51s">of neurological organization and some of them
are quite fixed--they're automatic deterministic</a>

that are picking up the light get exhausted</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h32m12s">and then so they stop transmitting.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h32m13s">And so part of the reason you're zipping your
eyes back and forth is so that different parts</a>
00:32:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h32m18s">of your eye can process the scene and it doesn't
get exhausted.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h32m21s">And plus, you're also looking around and you're

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h32m29s">And so, you're actually kind of using your
eyes like tentacles, you know, to check out</a>
00:32:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h32m35s">the information that's coded in the light.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h32m39s">And even when you hear and that sort of thing
there's a fair bit of motor activity associated</a>
00:32:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h32m43s">with it--you turn your head unconsciously
and there's all sorts of little motor actions</a>
00:32:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h32m46s">in your ear that also help you tune in, and
so those things are tightly associated.</a>
00:32:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h32m51s">But roughly speaking, the motor output is
action.</a>
00:32:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h32m56s">And then Swanson shows that there are these
layers in the nervous system that go from</a>
00:32:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h33m02s">the spinal cord upward.</a>
00:33:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h33m05s">The first ones are the somatomotor neuron
pools, and the second are locomotor pattern</a>
00:33:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h33m09s">generators, and the third are locomotor pattern
initiators and then the forth are locomotor</a>
00:33:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h33m15s">pattern controllers.</a>
00:33:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h33m16s">It's a hierarchy.</a>
00:33:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h33m17s">And so, the way to kind of lay Piaget on it,
in some sense, is to think of the somatomotor</a>
00:33:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h33m23s">neuron pools as simple actions that can be
implemented automatically.</a>
00:33:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h33m30s">And then the locomotor pattern generator has
taken those simple actions and chained them</a>
00:33:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h33m35s">into relatively more complex melodies of action,
so kinetic melodies, and then the locomotor</a>
00:33:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h33m44s">pattern initiator more or less decides when
those kenetic melodies should be implemented.</a>
00:33:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h33m49s">And even that can be unconscious.</a>
00:33:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h33m52s">So it's still at that level of brain organization,
it's still more or less automatic.</a>
00:33:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h33m56s">Even stimulus-response is a way to think about
it.</a>
00:33:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h33m59s">And then you go one level higher and that's
when you get the ability to voluntarily use</a>
00:33:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h34m04s">these automated things.</a>
00:34:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h34m06s">So I can show you an example of how this works.</a>
00:34:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h34m09s">This is called a ballistic movement.</a>
00:34:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h34m11s">So, I'm going to take my hand and I'm going
to bring it down really fast right toward</a>
00:34:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h34m15s">that edge.</a>
00:34:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h34m16s">Okay so--alright now, so that's very fast
movement.</a>
00:34:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h34m21s">Now one of the things that's cool about that
movement is that I don't have time, once that</a>
00:34:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h34m27s">action starts, it happens so fast that it's
done by the time that the information about</a>
00:34:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h34m34s">that action actually gets to my brain.</a>
00:34:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h34m38s">Once I let that go, I can't control it.</a>
00:34:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h34m42s">What I basically am doing is disinhibiting
the motor control systems that I already have</a>
00:34:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h34m49s">established in my psychophysiological being.</a>
00:34:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h34m53s">I'm disinhibiting one of those and then it
runs automatically.</a>
00:34:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h34m57s">And so that's what you're doing all the time
when you're acting in life.</a>
00:34:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h35m02s">It's kind of a neat--I wrote a paper a while
back with an undergraduate student of mine,</a>
00:35:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h35m07s">he was a pretty bright character, and we got
invited to do a paper--I got invited to do</a>
00:35:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h35m12s">a paper--on free will, and so we were thinking
about free will and, it's very interesting</a>
00:35:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h35m18s">to think about free will in relationship to
these hierarchies because it sort of goes</a>
00:35:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h35m22s">like this: it's that, out there in the future,
you've got free will.</a>
00:35:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h35m27s">But as the future moves towards the present,
you don't.</a>
00:35:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h35m31s">Once it gets close enough to the present you
have to have initiated something automatic</a>
00:35:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h35m36s">that will happen.</a>
00:35:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h35m37s">And so I can give you an example.</a>
00:35:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h35m39s">People who play the piano very well, they
look ahead of where they're playing in the</a>
00:35:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h35m45s">music.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h35m46s">Because they know how to do this, they don't
have to think about it.</a>
00:35:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h35m49s">What they have to do is look ahead so that
the part of them that knows how to do this</a>
00:35:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h35m52s">gets ready to do it.</a>
00:35:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h35m54s">And all of you are experts in that way likely--all
of those of you who drive--you're also experts</a>
00:35:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h35m59s">that way.</a>
00:35:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h36m00s">Because when you're driving, where do you
look?</a>
00:36:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h36m01s">If you're a good driver, on the highway, you
look at least half a second or a second ahead.</a>
00:36:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h36m07s">Why?</a>
00:36:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h36m08s">Well because 50 feet ahead has already happened.</a>
00:36:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h36m12s">Right, it's too close in time for you to do
anything about it, so basically what you're</a>
00:36:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h36m16s">doing is you're looking at the road and then
you're disinhibiting sequences of actions--the</a>
00:36:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h36m23s">ones that are going to correspond to what
you want to do with the road most adequately.</a>
00:36:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h36m28s">And the closer you get to executing one of
those motor behaviours, the more automated</a>
00:36:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h36m34s">it is.</a>
00:36:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h36m35s">SO by the time you manifest the action, there's
no free will there at all.</a>
00:36:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h36m38s">But you set it up to be released in some sense.</a>
00:36:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h36m42s">So I can say, well, there's no free will in
that, but there was in deciding to do it at</a>
00:36:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h36m48s">that point.</a>
00:36:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h36m50s">So and that's sort of how your automaticity
meets your freedom.</a>
00:36:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h36m55s">You've got to think about it as something
extending across time.</a>
00:36:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h36m58s">Okay, so having established that then we're
going to get into the neurological localization</a>
00:36:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h37m11s">a little bit.</a>
00:37:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h37m12s">So you might say, well you collect all these
patterns of behaviour and then you automate</a>
00:37:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h37m17s">them into routines.</a>
00:37:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h37m19s">I can give you an example, so, for a child,
you know, when a child is first born, if you</a>
00:37:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h37m24s">tap on its cheek it'll go like this.</a>
00:37:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h37m26s">It's called a rooting reflex, and it'll move
its mouth and tongue.</a>
00:37:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h37m30s">Well what it’s doing, roughly speaking,
is its searching for a nipple, and if you</a>
00:37:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h37m34s">just put your finger there it'll clamp onto
that and start to suck.</a>
00:37:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h37m38s">And so the child comes out with that ability.</a>
00:37:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h37m41s">And that's a reflex, it's sort of built into
the neurology.</a>
00:37:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h37m44s">But then when the child starts to interact
with the mother to actually breastfeed, well</a>
00:37:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h37m48s">then that initial reflex has to be modified
quite substantially in the context of the</a>
00:37:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h37m55s">relationship with the mother because the bare
reflex, it's enough to get the thing going</a>
00:37:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h37m59s">but it's not enough to make it work.</a>
00:37:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h38m01s">And so often mothers take a fair bit of time
to learn how to breastfeed, but it's also</a>
00:38:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h38m06s">because the baby is taking a fair bit of time
to learn how to do it.</a>
00:38:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h38m09s">So they have to establish the dance that goes
with that.</a>
00:38:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h38m13s">And one of the things that's quite cool about
that dance, so to speak, is there's been studies</a>
00:38:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h38m18s">done of depressed and non-depressed mothers
interacting with their infants.</a>
00:38:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h38m22s">And so if you take a non-depressed mother
interacting with her infant and you just film</a>
00:38:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h38m27s">them, and you speed up the film, you can see
the baby reacts and the mother reacts and</a>
00:38:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h38m33s">the baby reacts and the mother reacts and
it's like a dance, you know, there's this</a>
00:38:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h38m35s">continual flow of information between the

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h38m39s">And if the baby's with a depressed mother
that doesn't happen.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h38m42s">It's jerky and discontinuous.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h38m45s">And so if you think about that you can see
how the dialectical interaction between the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h38m50s">mother and child is building up the child's

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h38m59s">I know I told you guys before, roughly speaking,
that kids really get socialized to play with</a>
00:38:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h39m06s">each other between two and four.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h39m09s">But that's not exactly true because even at
the lower level, more automated, and more</a>
00:39:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h39m15s">primordial reflex behaviours, like the ones
that are associated with breastfeeding, even</a>
00:39:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h39m21s">those develop under the constraints of social
guidelines.</a>
00:39:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h39m26s">So society's always there, right from the
reflex level up.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h39m30s">But you know what happens when kids are between
two and four, they have to learn to actually</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h39m35s">play, they have to learn how to play complex
games with other children and so that involves</a>
00:39:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h39m41s">communication and negotiation at a verbal

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h39m47s">So you know, it's continuous in some sense
and discontinuous in another sense.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h39m53s">Okay so anyways, you might say well why do
you bother stringing all these things together,</a>
00:39:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h39m57s">and well, you think about the breastfeeding
issue.</a>
00:39:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h40m00s">Why does a baby bother to learn how to breastfeed?</a>
00:40:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h40m02s">Well, that's pretty obvious isn't it.</a>
00:40:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h40m04s">I mean, first of all, if it doesn’t then
it doesn't live.</a>
00:40:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h40m09s">And there's a bunch of reasons for that--one
is obviously it's not going to be nourished</a>
00:40:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h40m13s">properly, although, there are things you can
do to substitute for that.</a>
00:40:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h40m17s">Although still, breastfeeding still seems
to be the best thing you can do for your baby.</a>
00:40:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h40m21s">Although, you can work around it, but fundamentally
it seems to be the best thing you can do.</a>
00:40:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h40m26s">But then the baby's also learning all sorts
of other things, like it's got skin-to-skin</a>
00:40:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h40m29s">contact and it's snuggling and it being comforted
and doing eye gaze to eye gaze and it's cooing</a>
00:40:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h40m34s">and the mother's imitating it and there's
just a lot of things going on there.</a>
00:40:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h40m39s">And so the child is organizing all that, partly
to fulfill a basic biological need, which</a>
00:40:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h40m45s">is two needs, both thirst and hunger, but
it’s also fulfilling its need for play,</a>
00:40:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h40m50s">for example, because children have a circuit
for play.</a>
00:40:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h40m53s">So you could say play is part of the id--it's
a fundamental biological need.</a>
00:40:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h40m58s">The other thing children have to have is skin-to-skin
touch--they'll die without it, it's not optional.</a>
00:40:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h41m05s">You even see that in rats.</a>
00:41:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h41m07s">So if you take a rat pup away from its mother
and you feed it, but you don't do anything</a>
00:41:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h41m11s">with it, it just dies.</a>
00:41:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h41m12s">It goes into opiate overdose roughly speaking--its
gastrointestinal systems shut down--and then</a>
00:41:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h41m18s">it dies.</a>
00:41:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h41m19s">And you can stop that from happening by isolating
it, feeding it, and then like massaging it</a>
00:41:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h41m24s">with the eraser end of the pencil--you can
keep the rat pup alive.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h41m29s">And Jaak Panksepp was one of the people either
discovered that or worked on it, and that</a>
00:41:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h41m34s">word was extended by Tiffany Fields in a hospital
in Florida--some really brilliant work.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h41m41s">She was looking at Panksepp's work on the
necessity of tactile stimulation and she thought,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h41m47s">hey I bet we could try that with premature
babies.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h41m50s">Because if a baby's premature, a couple of
things are problems.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h41m53s">I mean, first of all, at the need of the term,
pregnancy term, that's when babies lay on</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h41m59s">You know, so they come out and they've got
some storage there in case things don't get</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h42m04s">going very well.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h42m05s">And they're gaining a lot of weight in that
last period of pregnancy, so if they come</a>
00:42:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h42m09s">out premature then they're really skinny.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h42m12s">And then what happens often is they start
to lose weight and that's not good because</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h42m15s">they should be ramping up the weight gain
really quickly.</a>
00:42:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h42m18s">A newborn baby will outgrow its clothes in
one week, you know, they're gaining weight</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h42m25s">The premature babies lose weight, and it's
hard to keep them going.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h42m28s">They put them in an incubator, they feed them,
but what Tiffany Field did was, she had the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h42m49s">Which in baby terms is like forever, right.</a>
00:42:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h42m51s">I mean you change as much from zero months
to six months as you probably do from six</a>
00:42:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h42m55s">months to 20 years old.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h42m57s">It's such a radical transformation.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h43m00s">Okay, the reason I'm telling you all this
is because, you lay out these hierarchies</a>
00:43:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h43m06s">of behaviour that are well practiced and automatized
and brought under the control of social conditioning,</a>
00:43:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h43m11s">but you really do them in the service of--well
that's the question.</a>
00:43:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h43m17s">In the service of, we'll say, biological necessity,
for the sake of argument.</a>
00:43:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h43m21s">Well you have to eat and you have to drink,
and so one of the reasons you lay out the</a>
00:43:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h43m26s">hierarchy that's associated with breastfeeding
is so that you can do that directly, but also</a>
00:43:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h43m31s">so that you can establish a relationship so
that not only are you doing it directly this</a>
00:43:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h43m36s">day, but you're also going to do it tomorrow
and the next day and the day after that.</a>
00:43:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h43m41s">And so the hunger system is integrated with
these other systems of biological constraint</a>
00:43:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h43m48s">in some sense, and they're trying to come
up with an answer to the continual problem.</a>
00:43:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h43m53s">So you have dedicated biological systems that
help you address problems that are associated</a>
00:43:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h44m00s">problems that are associated with your biological
nature that are universal.</a>
00:44:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h44m04s">And those would be the things that Freud would
describe as the id.</a>
00:44:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h44m06s">So you can think of these hierarchies of motor
behaviour, which sort of develop up into sub</a>
00:44:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h44m14s">personalities, as nested in some sense inside
of motivational states.</a>
00:44:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h44m19s">So there's the motorbehavious hierarchy that
you use when you're angry, there's the motorbehaviour</a>
00:44:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h44m24s">hierarchy you use when you're distressed--and
kids get very good at that, you know, so they'll</a>
00:44:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h44m30s">cry, which is a reflex, but by the time they're
about two, they're pretty damn good at crying.</a>
00:44:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h44m36s">You know, they've got a cry that sounds like
they're sad and upset when they're really</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h44m41s">And so if you really listen you can hear the
difference.</a>
00:44:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h44m44s">Because an angry baby sounds different than
a sad baby.</a>
00:44:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h44m48s">But if you don't listen, the baby will have
you thinking it's sad no problem.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h44m52s">Then you'll feel sorry for it and go help
it out, and really it's just thinking "up</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h44m57s">So we know this partly because--so let's say
you've got a baby and it's under nine months,</a>
00:44:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h45m03s">six months old, and it's crying in its crib.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h45m07s">You go in there and you pick up the baby and
you comfort it and you probably do that pretty</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h45m14s">be in utero--they're very young.</a>
00:45:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h45m16s">But by nine months that baby's starting to
get smart.</a>
00:45:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h45m20s">And so it's about nine months when it can
visually recognize people it knows and people</a>
00:45:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h45m25s">he/she doesn’t know.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h45m28s">And then, so the baby's in there and it's
squawking a bit and so, it wants some attention,</a>
00:45:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h45m33s">and then someone walks in and it's not the
mother.</a>
00:45:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h45m35s">And the baby bursts into tears and people
think the baby's all sad because its mother</a>
00:45:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h45m39s">didn't show up.</a>
00:45:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h45m40s">It's not sad, it's really irritated that the
wrong person showed up.</a>
00:45:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h45m45s">And you can tell that because people have
done facial coding of the baby's expression</a>
00:45:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h45m49s">and also its skin tone and an angry baby looks
angry.</a>
00:45:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h45m53s">First of all it turns all red, it's really
angry.</a>
00:45:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h45m56s">And you see that behaviour later too in temper
tantrums.</a>
00:45:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h45m59s">Like a two year old that's having a temper
tantrum is just having a fit of rage.</a>
00:45:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h46m05s">The rage system, because there is a rage system,
is just completely out of control, it's just</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h46m10s">absolutely dominating their behaviour.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h46m13s">You don't really want to encourage that because
the rage system should start to be modulated</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h46m18s">by other systems and other higher order control

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h46m21s">Not so much suppressed or repressed which
is sort of how the Freudians would think , but</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h46m26s">integrated into more complex and sophisticated

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h46m31s">anger--which is an extraordinarily useful
capacity, because it allows you to defend</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h46m36s">yourself--so the child can learn to use that

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h46m47s">That's a functional child--it's not like it's
learned to repress its anger, it's just that</a>
00:46:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h46m51s">it gets along with people and never has to
get angry.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h46m54s">So, now some kids learn to repress their anger
because they're in a household where any manifestation</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h47m01s">of anger is dealt with very very harshly.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h47m04s">And maybe there's a rule that everyone has
to be nice to each other all the time, or</a>
00:47:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h47m09s">else.</a>
00:47:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h47m10s">Sort of a paradoxical rule.</a>
00:47:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h47m12s">But anyways, you can imagine there's a lot
of these biological systems and so I want</a>
00:47:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h47m17s">to show you some of their instantiation here,
so let's look at this one.</a>
00:47:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h47m23s">When you get up above the spinal cord, there's
a little brain area, I'll show you about how</a>
00:47:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h47m29s">big it is.</a>
00:47:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h47m30s">There it is.</a>
00:47:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h47m31s">So there's your brain, the top-on part, the
part on top, that's the cerebral cortex.</a>
00:47:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h47m37s">That's the part that people are really proud
of.</a>
00:47:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h47m39s">It's like, oh wow, look at our cerebral cortex.</a>
00:47:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h47m41s">Doesn't it have a lot of neurons [student
laughter].</a>
00:47:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h47m45s">Then, in the middle there, there are older
brain area--phylogenetically old--and then</a>
00:47:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h47m50s">as you go down toward the spinal cord they
basically get older and older and older and</a>
00:47:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h47m53s">older.</a>
00:47:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h47m55s">And more and more critical to your development.</a>
00:47:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h47m59s">So the serotonin system, we talked about it
a little bit in lobsters, right.</a>
00:47:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h48m03s">The serotonin system determines where a lobster
is in a dominance hierarchy, it determines</a>
00:48:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h48m08s">whether it stands like this or whether it
stands like this.</a>
00:48:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h48m11s">That's an old system.</a>
00:48:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h48m12s">And when your brain is developing in utero
it's the serotonin system that guides its</a>
00:48:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h48m17s">development.</a>
00:48:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h48m18s">So that's how important it is, sort of like
the conductor of the orchestra, but it's also</a>
00:48:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h48m22s">the thing that controls the entire unfolding
of the brain.</a>
00:48:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h48m26s">And it's a really really archaic system, so
in some sense your being is controlled by</a>
00:48:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h48m36s">these things that are ancient, beyond comprehension.</a>
00:48:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h48m38s">Anyways, you look at the hypothalamus and
you think, well that's not very big.</a>
00:48:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h48m44s">And yeah, it's not.</a>
00:48:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h48m46s">But, if you take a cat and you--so a cat brain
looks something like that--if you take off</a>
00:48:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h48m52s">all the stuff that's in light orange and most
of the top of the stuff that's above the hypothalamus</a>
00:48:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h48m57s">that's in white--you just take all that out,
and it's a female cat and it's in a cage--you</a>
00:48:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h49m02s">really can't tell the difference between it
and a cat that has all the rest of that brain.</a>
00:49:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h49m07s">Now there's some things it can't do.</a>
00:49:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h49m09s">It doesn't do very well if you take it into
a new situation because it can't learn.</a>
00:49:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h49m14s">More importantly in some sense, it can't remember.</a>
00:49:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h49m18s">So it's in a perpetual sense of everything
happening for the very first time.</a>
00:49:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h49m22s">But it's still capable of a lot of the reactions
that would be necessary for you to stay alive.</a>
00:49:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h49m27s">SO it can regulate its liquid intake, it can
regulate its food intake, it can react sexually,</a>
00:49:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h49m32s">it's capable of defensive aggression, although
it'll really fly into a rage so it's kind</a>
00:49:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h49m36s">of like a disinhibited two year old in some
sense.</a>
00:49:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h49m40s">And as long as you keep it in the cage and
provide it with food and water it's like the</a>
00:49:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h49m45s">way it lives.</a>
00:49:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h49m47s">And it's hyper exploratory which I think is
just weird beyond belief.</a>
00:49:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h49m50s">You know, you take the brain off a cat and
then all it wants to do is explore.</a>
00:49:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h49m54s">Which is not what you think at all.</a>
00:49:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h49m56s">It's like, a cat with no brain is really curious--it
just doesn't make sense.</a>
00:49:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h50m01s">But it does actually because the systems that
drive your exploratory urge are rooted in</a>
00:50:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h50m06s">that hypothalamus and they're actually the
same systems--it's individual differences</a>
00:50:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h50m13s">in the functions and sensitivity of those
systems that are in part associated with individual</a>
00:50:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h50m18s">differences in extraversion.</a>
00:50:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h50m20s">So extroverts are sort of hyper exploratory
in social situations.</a>
00:50:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h50m23s">Whereas introverts aren't.</a>
00:50:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h50m25s">And the exploratory circuit that has its origins
in the hypothalamus runs on dopamine, roughly</a>
00:50:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h50m32s">speaking, and then it runs through the base
of your brain and then up into your prefrontal</a>
00:50:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h50m37s">cortex in particular.</a>
00:50:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h50m38s">And it's also the system that responds to
cocaine and amphetamines and other drugs that</a>
00:50:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h50m43s">people like to take because they heighten
positive emotion.</a>
00:50:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h50m47s">So it's variability at a very very low level
in the brain that determines things like the</a>
00:50:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h50m53s">differences in extraverts and introverts.</a>
00:50:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h50m55s">Anyways, it's this tiny little part of the
brain and if that's all you have you can get</a>
00:50:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h51m03s">along not too bad.</a>
00:51:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h51m06s">But that's also because it's tiny from one
level of analysis, but it's really big from</a>
00:51:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h51m11s">another.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h51m12s">I mean, you can increase your resolution when
you're doing brain analysis all the way down</a>
00:51:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h51m19s">to the molecular level and still be looking
at the brain, you know.</a>
00:51:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h51m23s">Below the molecular level, at the atomic level,
well everything's made out of atoms.</a>
00:51:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h51m28s">But the brain is already there at a molecular
level and it's insanely complicated at a molecular</a>
00:51:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h51m33s">level, and the hypothalamus is way bigger

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h51m38s">And so even though it's small compared to
the rest of our brain it's still a whopping</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h51m43s">big structure by atomic standards and so there's
a hell of a lot going on down there.</a>
00:51:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h51m47s">And you notice the hypothalamus, you might
say, is there such a thing as the id.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h51m53s">Well, yes and no.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h51m56s">Is it in the brain?</a>
00:51:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h51m57s">Yes and no.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h51m58s">A really low resolution representation of
what's in the brain, that's one way of thinking</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h52m05s">But then you might say, is there a hypothalamus?</a>
00:52:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h52m07s">And the answer to that is, well, yes and no.</a>
00:52:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h52m10s">Because there's the hypothalamic structure,
and you see it's made out of a bunch of things</a>
00:52:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h52m14s">that are different.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h52m15s">And so you could say, well should you even
group those things together.</a>
00:52:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h52m18s">And the answer to that is, it depends on why
you're grouping them together.</a>
00:52:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h52m22s">If it's useful for some purpose of understanding

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h52m30s">similar in the way that they emerge in the
course of brain development, and they're roughly</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h52m34s">of the same phylogenetic age--but there's
lots of reasons to treat them as the same</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h52m40s">It depends on what you're trying to do.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h52m43s">Anyways, the hypothalamus has all these little
sub-structures that are really in some sense</a>
00:52:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h52m56s">at the core of the sub-personalities that
we talked about.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h53m00s">So, for example--okay so this is Swanson again
and he's showing you--this is a rat's brain</a>
00:53:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h53m12s">from the bottom--and he's showing you the
layout of the hypothalamus.</a>
00:53:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h53m16s">You see it's got all those different nuclei.</a>
00:53:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h53m19s">It doesn't look like one thing, it looks like
a bunch of things.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h53m22s">And so here he says, the descending paraventricular
nucleus is involved in the control of eating</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h53m30s">and drinking, and that's shown in green.</a>
00:53:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h53m33s">So that's the thing that--when you get hungry
or thirsty--that's the thing that sort of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h53m37s">turns on your hungry and thirsty sub-personality.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h53m40s">And then the rest of the cell groups play
a major role in controlling two classes of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h53m55s">So now what you can think is, you have all
those little subroutines that we talked about,</a>
00:53:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h54m00s">that're sort of at hand and ready to go, and

do something--like eat--and so it's like there's</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h59m50s">you're organizing those into more and more

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=00h59m53s">And you need the cortex to do that because
the cortex is partly what enables you to think</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h00m10s">You can probably get some sense of that--like
one of the things that happens to people if</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h00m26s">And so then they enter a state where it's

despite that, you're not functional.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h00m40s">And so in some sense you trade that transcendent

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h08m04s">It's like all of a sudden these eyes pop up

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h08m17s">Well, if you're looking here and there's something
there with eyes and teeth, you should probably</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h08m23s">So what that basically means is that you've
got this tiny little fovea, which is right</a>
01:08:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h08m27s">in the centre of your retina, it's just densely

just connected like mad to cells in the visual</a>

can't connect all the cells in your retina</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h08m49s">So you get by, and part of the way you get
by is you're always moving your eyes around.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h08m54s">And so it looks like you can see everything,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h09m08s">I would say.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h09m12s">So out here, who cares what colour it is.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h09m16s">So you just don't see the colour.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h09m17s">But you don't know that you don't see the

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h09m19s">Now of course, I can have my hands here, and
then I put them here--I can hardly see them--and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h09m23s">then oop, they're gone.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h09m45s">isn't even not there, that's how gone it is.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h09m48s">Okay, so part of the way your eyes work is
that the periphery is attached to devices,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h09m55s">in some sense, and some of them detect lines
and some of them detect movement.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h10m08s">And cats are like that to some degree.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h10m09s">They can really see things move this way.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h10m12s">Partly because their eyes are slitted, makes
it easier for them to see things moving like</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h10m16s">this.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h10m21s">Mice will--most mice, except ones that hop

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h10m26s">so cats are specialized for that.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h10m28s">And so you're also specialized to see teeth

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h12m28s">what it looked like.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h12m33s">It's like, yeah okay, you didn't know it was

to echolocate.</a>
01:12:40</p>
<p>[So they go click-click-click, they don't make
that noise exactly, but they do click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h12m44s">clicking</a>
01:12:44</p>
<p>[sounds] and they can detect the clicks bouncing
off of things.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h12m48s)

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h12m52s">And they can do that well enough, not only
to walk, but some of them can actually ride</a>
01:12:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h12m54s">bikes.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h12m56s">It's like, hey that's impressive, man.</a>
01:12:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h13m00s">Yeah, there's one kid--I saw a kid on youtube
who's blind who could shoot baskets, yeah,</a>
01:13:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h13m05s">which is--that's impressive, man.</a>
01:13:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h13m08s">But my point is that a lot of the neural tissue
is--it'll take whatever input it gets.</a>
01:13:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h13m14s">So if you're born blind, your auditory systems
will invade your visual system.</a>
01:13:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h13m20s">And then you have twice as much brain devoted
to your hearing.</a>
01:13:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h13m23s">So, and then you know, you can use that quite
effectively.</a>
01:13:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h13m26s">So I think we're probably pretty much out
of time.</a>
01:13:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h13m30s">One thing I want to tell you before we go
on to the next part though is that--so now</a>
01:13:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h13m34s">we've sort of built up the idea of these underlying
motivational systems.</a>
01:13:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h13m39s">And now you can kind of see how they work,
so you might say to yourself, why didn't you</a>
01:13:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h13m45s">see the gorilla and the curtain and the person
leaving.</a>
01:13:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h13m49s">It's really complicated, it's really complicated.</a>
01:13:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h13m52s">Well, the first answer is, you did what I
asked.</a>
01:13:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h13m58s">And then you might ask, well why?</a>
01:13:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h14m00s">Why did you do what I asked?</a>
01:14:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h14m01s">I mean you missed the damn gorilla, right.</a>
01:14:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h14m03s">It's like, obviously that wasn't a very good
decision.</a>
01:14:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h14m06s">So you think, well why did you do what I asked?</a>
01:14:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h14m09s">And the answer would be--well, it's sort of
like the Milgram obedience experiment except</a>
01:14:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h14m14s">at a way lower level.</a>
01:14:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h14m16s">It's like, we've got an agreement going on
here.</a>
01:14:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h14m19s">You guys are all very sophisticated and complex
game players, otherwise you couldn't sit here</a>
01:14:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h14m25s">peacefully for an hour and a half.</a>
01:14:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h14m27s">So you're very well socialized, all of you.</a>
01:14:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h14m30s">And so that means you've organized all your
motivations into a hierarchy, and that hierarchy</a>
01:14:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h14m36s">is guiding your behaviour here.</a>
01:14:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h14m37s">It might be something like, well we need to
learn something and hypothetically, you come</a>
01:14:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h14m41s">here and you learn something.</a>
01:14:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h14m42s">And so you're playing that out.</a>
01:14:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h14m44s">And because that's the motivational state
that you're in, when I ask you to do something,</a>
01:14:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h14m50s">you're just going to do it.</a>
01:14:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h14m52s">Well then, what's so cool is that as soon
as you decide to point your attention at something,</a>
01:14:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h15m00s">what you see in the world radically transforms.</a>
01:15:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h15m03s">So I say, well count the basketballs and all
of a sudden all you can see are basketballs.</a>
01:15:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h15m07s">And you think, no no, I see--I'm not blind.</a>
01:15:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h15m10s">It's like well, you're pretty damn blind.</a>
01:15:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h15m13s">And so, that's partly how you can understand
how motivation is a sub-personality.</a>
01:15:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h15m19s">Like it has its whole sets of perceptions
and values.</a>
01:15:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h15m22s">It's like, all of a sudden, I set you up in
a little motivated state--it was a complicated</a>
01:15:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h15m27s">one--but it was just like, here's a task.</a>
01:15:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h15m30s">And so you're all motivated, you're going
to do the task properly, for god only knows</a>
01:15:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h15m34s">how many reasons, and then all of a sudden,
all that exists in the world are basketballs.</a>
01:15:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h15m40s">And so, it's as if your goal-directed attention
has transformed the phenomenology of the world.</a>
01:15:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h15m48s">And that's something that's really cool because
one of the things it implies is that what</a>
01:15:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h15m54s">you see of the world depends on what you're
aiming at.</a>
01:15:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h15m57s">And in a real sense--this isn't some trivial
sense.</a>
01:15:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h15m59s">It means like literally what you're aiming
at--I'm going to count the basketballs--it</a>
01:15:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h16m04s">means, well you're not noticing the gorillas.</a>
01:16:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h16m07s">So one of the things that you might ask yourself,
and this is partly what the phenomenologists</a>
01:16:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h16m10s">were on about is, what're you aiming at?</a>
01:16:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h16m14s">And what is it that what you're aiming at
allows you to see, and what is it that what</a>
01:16:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h16m20s">you're aiming at blinds you to.</a>
01:16:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h16m22s">And it blinds you to a lot more than it allows
you to see.</a>
01:16:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h16m26s">And so another thing that you can think about
is like, if everything you see makes you angry</a>
01:16:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h16m29s">and bitter and resentful, you might think,
well hmm, what exactly am I aiming at that's</a>
01:16:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h16m36s">making the world organize itself around me
in that manner?</a>
01:16:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h16m39s">And that would be a complex, for a Jungian
perspective.</a>
01:16:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h16m45s">A complex would do that.</a>
01:16:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h16m46s">So it's a set of values, they're sort of economist,
they inhabit you, it's a sub-personality,</a>
01:16:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h16m51s">it's quite complex, it's got something it's
aiming at.</a>
01:16:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h16m54s">You might not even know what that is because
you're acting it out instead of understanding</a>
01:16:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h16m58s">it.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h16m59s">And because you're inside of it, it lays the
world out for you in a particular way that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h17m03s">makes the world look like it's showing you

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h17m15s">And that's one of the things that's so damn

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h17m19s">It's like, really?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h17m37s">A lot of them are biologically motivated.</a>
01:17:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h17m39s">And you turn those into a hierarchy and that's
sort of your higher value system and then</a>
01:17:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h17m43s">that thing points you at something, and the
whole world lays itself out around that.</a>
01:17:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h17m48s">And the way it does it is divides the world
into irrelevant things--and so those would've</a>
01:17:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h17m52s">been the curtains in this particular example,
or the gorilla or even the player in black</a>
01:17:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h17m57s">who left the game--irrelevant, because it
didn't interfere with you counting.</a>
01:17:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h18m01s">So what you look at makes most of the world
irrelevant.</a>
01:18:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h18m05s">It makes some things , things that serve you.</a>
01:18:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h18m07s">And that makes you feel positive emotion.</a>
01:18:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h18m10s">And it makes other things things that get
in your way.</a>
01:18:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h18m12s">And that's what makes negative emotions.</a>
01:18:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h18m14s">And so you've got the hypothalamic systems
that point you in biological directions.</a>
01:18:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h18m19s">You organize those, and then, as you're approaching
the things you're aiming at, the positive</a>
01:18:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h18m25s">emotion systems tell you you're on track and
the negative emotion systems tell you when</a>
01:18:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h18m29s">something's interfering.</a>
01:18:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h18m30s">And those are actually different neurological
systems.</a>
01:18:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h18m34s">So they're not in the hypothalamus.</a>
01:18:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h18m36s">The positive emotion system is in some degree.</a>
01:18:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h18m38s">But the negative emotion system, that evolved
later.</a>
01:18:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h18m41s">And there's a couple of them.</a>
01:18:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h18m42s">There's one that produces pain, we'll talk
about it more.</a>
01:18:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h18m45s">And there's another one that produces anxiety.</a>
01:18:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h18m47s">And so, now you kind of understand--roughly--the
relationship between motivation, perception,</a>
01:18:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h18m55s">and emotion.</a>
01:18:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h18m57s">They all act together.</a>
01:18:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h19m00s">And they're all dependent in this weird way
on what you're after.</a>
01:19:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h19m04s">So you can think for 50 years and you won't
get to the bottom of it.</a>
01:19:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h19m07s">You know the Buddhists say that everything
is illusion.</a>
01:19:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h19m10s">Maya, right, people live in illusion.</a>
01:19:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h19m12s">Because what you're aiming at determines what
you see.</a>
01:19:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f511uRzsHhQ#t=01h19m15s">So, anyways, it's worth thinking about.</a>
