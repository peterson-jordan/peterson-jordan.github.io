					<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h00m01s">I will now read a short story by Kurt Vonnegut Jr. called "Harrison Bergeron."</a>
00:00:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h00m09s">The year was 2081 and finally everyone was equal.</a>
00:00:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h00m13s">They were equal not only before God and the laws. They were equal in every way.</a>
00:00:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h00m18s">No one was smarter than anyone else. No one looked better than anyone else. No one was stronger or faster than anyone else.</a>
00:00:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h00m25s">All this equality was due to the 211st, 212th and 213th amendments to the Constitution,</a>
00:00:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h00m31s">and the tireless vigilance of the agents of the United States General Hinder.</a>
00:00:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h00m38s">However, some things in life were not quite right.</a>
00:00:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h00m41s">April, for example, still drove people crazy because spring wasn't coming yet.</a>
00:00:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h00m46s">It was in this rainy month that the Chief Troubleman's men took George and Hazel Bergeron's fourteen-year-old son, Harrison.</a>
00:00:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h00m53s">The event was tragic, no doubt, but George and Hazel could not think deeply about it.</a>
00:00:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h00m57s">Hazel had a normal average intelligence, which meant she couldn't think of anything but brief bursts.</a>
00:00:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h01m03s">And George, whose intelligence was well above average, had a small radio in his ear for mental disorders.</a>
00:01:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h01m08s">The law required him to wear it at all times.</a>
00:01:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h01m12s">It was tuned to the waves of the government transmitter,</a>
00:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h01m14s">which sent a sharp sound every twenty seconds to keep people like George from taking advantage of their minds.</a>
00:01:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h01m22s">George and Hazel were watching TV.</a>
00:01:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h01m24s">There were tears on Hazel's cheeks, but at the moment she didn't remember why they were.</a>
00:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h01m29s">Ballerinas could be seen on the television screen.</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h01m32s">A bell rang in George's head.</a>
00:01:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h01m34s">His thoughts raced in panic, like thieves from an alarm system.</a>
00:01:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h01m38s">"It was a nice dance," Hazel said. "Which we just saw."</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h01m42s">"Um?" George asked.</a>
00:01:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h01m44s">"This dance," Hazel repeated. - He was nice.</a>
00:01:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h01m46s">"Yeah," George nodded.</a>
00:01:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h01m48s">He tried to think a little about the ballerinas.</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h01m51s">In fact, they were not very good - no better than anyone else in their place.</a>
00:01:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h01m55s">They were loaded with weights and lead bullets, and their faces were masked,</a>
00:01:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h01m59s">so that no one who could see a graceful gesture or a beautiful face,</a>
00:01:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h02m02s">not to feel like something the cat has brought from the street.</a>
00:02:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h02m06s">The white thought crossed his mind that maybe ballerinas shouldn't have artificial difficulties,</a>
00:02:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h02m10s">but he could not go very far in his thoughts, for they were interrupted by the next ringing.</a>
00:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h02m15s">George was startled. Two of the eight ballerinas were also startled.</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h02m18s">Hazel noticed his startle.</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h02m20s">Since she had no mental difficulty, she had to ask George what the last sound was.</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h02m26s">"It sounded like someone was hitting a milk bottle with a hammer," he said.</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h02m30s">"It must be very interesting to hear all these sounds," Hazel said with a slight envy. - All the things they come up with…</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h02m38s">"Hmm," George said.</a>
00:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h02m40s">"But if I were a General Hinder, do you know what I would do?" Hazel asked.</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h02m44s">She was, in fact, very much like the General Hinder, a woman named Diana Moon Glampers.</a>
00:02:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h02m52s">"If I were Diana Moon Glampers, I'd ring your bell on Sunday." Something like a homage to religion.</a>
00:02:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h02m59s">"If it's just a bell ringing," George said, "I'll be able to think."</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h03m02s">"Maybe I would make him very strong," Hazel decided. "It seems to me that a good General Difficulty would come out of me."</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h03m07s">"No better than anyone else."</a>
00:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h03m09s">"Who knows better than me what 'normal' means?"</a>
00:03:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h03m13s">"That's right," George nodded.</a>
00:03:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h03m15s">He began to think of his insane son, who was now in prison, of Harrison,</a>
00:03:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h03m21s">but twenty-one cannon salutes echoed in his head and put an end to it.</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h03m24s">- Oh! Hazel exclaimed. "It was great, wasn't it?"</a>
00:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h03m27s">It was so great that George turned pale and shivered. His reddened eyes filled with tears.</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h03m33s">Two of the eight ballerinas in the studio collapsed on the floor and grabbed their temples.</a>
00:03:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h03m38s">"Suddenly he looked so tired," Hazel said.</a>
00:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h03m41s">"Why don't you stretch out on the couch?" That way you can support the bag with your weights on the pillow, darling.</a>
00:03:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h03m47s">He meant a bag of twenty pounds of lead bullets, locked with a padlock around his neck.</a>
00:03:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h03m54s">- Go and support her, I do not mind for a while you are not equal to me.</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h03m59s">George lifted the bag slightly to feel its weight.</a>
00:03:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h04m02s">"I don't mind," he said. "I don't pay attention to her anymore." She has become a part of me.</a>
00:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h04m06s">"You seem tired to me lately," Hazel said. "Exhausted."</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h04m09s">Eh, how could we drill a hole in the bottom and take out a little, very little of the bullets ч</a>
00:04:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h04m16s">- Two years in prison and a fine of two thousand dollars for each ball… I don't think it's worth it.</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h04m24s">- If you could take out a little when you get back from work… I mean, you don't have to compete with anyone here… You just sit.</a>
00:04:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h04m32s">"If I do, others will, and that's it."</a>
00:04:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h04m36s">we found ourselves again in the dark times, when everyone competed with everyone else.</a>
00:04:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h04m41s">You won't like that, will you?</a>
00:04:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h04m43s">"Not at all."</a>
00:04:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h04m44s">- Here it is. The moment people start cheating and circumventing the laws, what do you think will happen to society?</a>
00:04:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h04m50s">If Hazel hadn't answered that question, George wouldn't have been able to help her, because the sirens sounded in his brain again.</a>
00:04:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h04m58s">"I guess it's going to fall apart," she shook her head.</a>
00:04:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h05m00s">"What?" George asked blankly.</a>
00:05:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h05m03s">"Society," Hazel repeated. "You just said that, didn't you?"</a>
00:05:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h05m07s">- Who knows? George asked.</a>
00:05:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h05m09s">Suddenly the TV program stopped because of the news.</a>
00:05:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h05m13s">At first it was not clear what was going on, because the speaker,</a>
00:05:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h05m16s">like all other speakers, he had difficulty speaking.</a>
00:05:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h05m19s">For a minute and a half, in a state of heightened excitement, he tried to say, "Ladies and gentlemen."</a>
00:05:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h05m25s">He finally gave up and handed the sheet to a ballerina to read.</a>
00:05:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h05m28s">"Nothing," George reassured him. "He tried." This is important.</a>
00:05:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h05m33s">He tried to do the best the Lord had given him. They have to raise him for trying so hard.</a>
00:05:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h05m39s">"Ladies and gentlemen," the ballerina began to read.</a>
00:05:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h05m42s">She must have been amazingly beautiful because her mask was awful.</a>
00:05:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h05m46s">It wasn't hard to see that she was the strongest and most graceful of all the dancers,</a>
00:05:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h05m50s">for her bag was as heavy as a man's.</a>
00:05:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h05m55s">He had to apologize for his voice because it was unfair for a woman to use such a voice.</a>
00:05:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h06m00s">Her voice was a warm, bright, timeless tune.</a>
00:06:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h06m04s">"Excuse me," the ballerina said, making her voice completely uncompetitive.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h06m10s">"Harrison Bergeron, fourteen," she growled unbearably,</a>

00:06:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h06m19s">He is a genius, an athlete, insufficiently inhibited and should be considered extremely dangerous.</a>
00:06:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h06m25s">A police photo of Harrison Bergeron appeared on the screen, upside down, then sideways, upside down again, then up on the right side.</a>
00:06:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h06m33s">The picture showed his height, compared to the wall in meters and centimeters at the back - he was exactly two meters tall.</a>
00:06:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h06m41s">The rest of his appearance was a carnival and a hardware store. No one had ever borne heavier or heavier weights.</a>
00:06:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h06m49s">He outgrew them faster than the General Hinder's people could think of new ones.</a>
00:06:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h06m53s">Instead of a small receiver in his ear, he wore huge headphones and glasses with thick, wavy magnifying glasses.</a>
00:06:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h07m01s">These glasses were not only to prevent him from seeing, but also to give him sharp headaches.</a>
00:07:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h07m07s">Pieces of metal hung all over his body.</a>
00:07:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h07m10s">Usually there was a sense of symmetry, a kind of military order in the obstacles of strong people,</a>
00:07:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h07m15s">but Harrison looked like a walking warehouse for recyclables.</a>
00:07:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h07m17s">In the race of his life he carried one hundred and fifty kilograms.</a>
00:07:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h07m21s">To spoil his good looks, the General Hinder's men had made him put on a red rubber ball instead of a nose,</a>
00:07:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h07m27s">to shave his eyebrows and cover his straight white teeth with chaotically arranged black crowns.</a>
00:07:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h07m33s">"If you see this boy," the ballerina continued, "don't, I repeat, don't try to have a sensible conversation with him."</a>
00:07:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h07m39s">There was a scream, as if someone had ripped a door from its hinges.</a>
00:07:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h07m42s">Screams and desperate shouts came from the TV.</a>
00:07:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h07m46s">Harrison Bergeron's picture swayed on the screen, as if dancing to the beat of an earthquake.</a>
00:07:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h07m53s">George Bergeron correctly defined what this earthquake was,</a>
00:07:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h07m57s">for his own home was repeatedly shaken by the same destructive rhythm.</a>
00:07:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h08m02s">"God!" He exclaimed. "It must be Harrison!"</a>
00:08:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h08m05s">The thought was instantly banished from his head by the sound of a car accident.</a>
00:08:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h08m11s">When he opened his eyes again, the picture of Harrison had disappeared from the screen.</a>
00:08:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h08m15s">It was filled with the real, living Harrison.</a>
00:08:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h08m18s">Jingling, huge, and resembling a clown, he swayed in the middle of the studio.</a>
00:08:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h08m23s">The handle of the broken door was still in his hand.</a>
00:08:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h08m26s">Ballerinas, technicians, musicians and speakers had fallen to their knees in anticipation of death.</a>
00:08:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h08m32s">"I am the Emperor!" Harrison roared.</a>
00:08:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h08m34s">"Do you hear?" I am the Emperor! Everyone should do what I say right away!</a>
00:08:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h08m38s">He stamped his foot and the studio shook.</a>
00:08:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h08m41s">"Even as I stand before you now — crippled, lame, sick," he continued to roar,</a>
00:08:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h08m45s">- I am the greatest ruler of all who have ever been born!</a>
00:08:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h08m47s">And now look what I can become!</a>
00:08:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h08m51s">Harrison tore the straps of his weights as if they were wet toilet paper, and they were guaranteed to weigh three hundred pounds.</a>
00:08:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h08m58s">The pieces of scrap iron rattled on the floor.</a>
00:08:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h09m01s">He thumbs his thumbs under the padlock's metal plate, holding the gear on his head. He broke it like a match.</a>
00:09:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h09m08s">Then he threw the glasses and headphones into the wall.</a>
00:09:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h09m11s">He removed his rubber nose and a man appeared on the screen who could perform Thor, the god of storms, with awe.</a>
00:09:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h09m17s">"And now I will choose my Empress!" He said, looking down at the trembling people.</a>
00:09:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h09m21s">"Let the first woman who dares to stand up come to me to take her partner and her throne!"</a>
00:09:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h09m25s">It was only a moment, then one of the ballerinas stood up and swayed like a weeping willow.</a>
00:09:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h09m30s">Harrison pulled the mental disability out of her ear, breaking the physical obstacles with astonishing ease.</a>
00:09:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h09m36s">He finally removed the mask. She was dazzlingly beautiful.</a>
00:09:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h09m40s">"Now," Harrison continued, taking her hand, "we're going to show people what the word dance means."</a>
00:09:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h09m45s">- Music! He commanded.</a>
00:09:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h09m47s">The musicians crawled to their chairs, and Harrison released them.</a>
00:09:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h09m52s">"Play as well as you can," he ordered, "and I will make you barons, dukes, and counts!"</a>
00:09:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h09m56s">The music began. In the beginning it was normal - cheap, stupid, insincere.</a>
00:09:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h10m04s">But Harrison grabbed two musicians from their seats, swung them in the air like baton, and sang the music he wanted to play.</a>
00:10:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h10m11s">Then he threw them on their chairs.</a>
00:10:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h10m13s">The orchestra played again, much better this time.</a>
00:10:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h10m16s">For a while, Harrison and his Empress just listened.</a>
00:10:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h10m20s">- grimly, as if they synchronized their hearts with the rhythm.</a>
00:10:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h10m23s">Then they shifted their center of gravity to their toes.</a>
00:10:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h10m25s">Harrison placed his huge hands on the girl's slender waist,</a>
00:10:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h10m28s">giving him the opportunity to experience the weightlessness that would soon belong to them.</a>
00:10:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h10m31s">Then they flew into the air, filled with joy and beauty.</a>
00:10:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h10m36s">They abandoned not only the laws of men, but also the laws of gravity and motion.</a>
00:10:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h10m41s">They drifted, spun, swam, flew, squatted. They jumped like deer on the moon.</a>
00:10:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h10m48s">The ceiling of the studio was ten meters high, but with each leap they approached it.</a>
00:10:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h10m52s">Apparently their goal was to kiss the ceiling. They kissed him.</a>
00:10:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h10m57s">Then they neutralized the effect of the law of gravity</a>
00:10:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h11m00s">and stayed a few inches below the ceiling, where they kissed for a long, long time.</a>
00:11:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h11m06s">Then Diana Moon Glampers, the General Hinder, entered the studio, armed with a tenth-caliber double-barreled shotgun.</a>
00:11:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h11m14s">He fired twice, and the Emperor and his Empress died before they fell to the floor.</a>
00:11:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h11m19s">Diana Moon Glampers loaded the rifle again.</a>
00:11:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h11m23s">He pointed it at the musicians and told them he was giving them ten seconds to put on their weights.</a>
00:11:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h11m28s">At that moment, the tube on Bergeron's TV set burned down.</a>
00:11:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h11m32s">Hazel turned to George to note the fact.</a>
00:11:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h11m35s">But George had gone to the kitchen to get a can of beer.</a>
00:11:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h11m39s">He returned with the beer and paused until the signal from the transmitter sounded. Then he sat down again.</a>
00:11:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h11m45s">"Did you cry?" He asked Hazel. "Yeah," she nodded.</a>
00:11:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h11m50s">"Why?"</a>
00:11:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h11m52s">- I forgot. For something on TV… really sad.</a>
00:11:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h11m55s">"What was that?"</a>
00:11:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h11m57s">"Everything is so confused in my head."</a>
00:11:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h12m00s">"Forget the sad things," George advised.</a>
00:12:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h12m03s">"I always forget them," Hazel said.</a>
00:12:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h12m05s">"Good girl," he nodded, startled.</a>
00:12:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h12m08s">Shots rattled in his head.</a>
00:12:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h12m11s">"God!" Obviously, the last one was great! Hazel looked at him.</a>
00:12:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDYuj1Bs6Y#t=00h12m14s">"Say it again."</a>
