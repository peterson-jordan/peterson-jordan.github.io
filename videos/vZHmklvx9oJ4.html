the basic story.</a>
00:00:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h00m14s">I want to talk to you today about how your

in mythology.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h00m22s">The first thing I’d like to point out, is
we talked about the difference between Darwinian</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h00m31s">and Newtonian viewpoints a while back.</a>
00:00:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h00m40s">One claim that you might make if you were
Darwinian is that whatever your brain is adapted</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h00m45s">to is reality.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h00m49s">That seems to be the central claim of Darwinian
evolution, is that you can’t define reality</a>
00:00:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h00m57s">any more accurately than that which selects.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h01m03s">I want to tell you about how I think the brain
is organized.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h01m08s">Then I want to show you, I hope, that the
way fundamental narratives work can be mapped</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h01m16s">on to that brain structure.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h01m19s">To me that implies that there’s something
right about fundamental narratives, because</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h01m26s">otherwise why would they map onto the brain

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h01m36s">People think about reality in objective terms,
and they think about it as decomposable into</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h01m43s">tiny subunits.</a>
00:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h01m47s">I think that’s a limited viewpoint, a powerful
but limited viewpoint.</a>
00:01:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h01m51s">I think it’s much more realistic to assume
that whatever reality is, is more like a continual</a>
00:01:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h02m00s">interplay of very, very complex patterns.</a>
00:02:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h02m04s">I suppose you could make the case that those
patterns are ultimately made out of particles,</a>
00:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h02m10s">but even that’s not exactly true because
the particles have to be arrayed in space.</a>
00:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h02m16s">That’s part of the atomic theory is that
there’s not just subatomic particles and</a>
00:02:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h02m22s">atomic particles, but that they’re arrayed
in space.</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h02m26s">If they’re arrayed in space, that means
the manner in which they’re arrayed can</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h02m30s">be informative.</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h02m31s">And if you reduce the phenoma to the particle,
without taking into account the patterning</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h02m38s">of array of the particles, then there are
levels and levels and levels of information</a>
00:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h02m42s">that you lose.</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h02m46s">Those levels of information are – they may
not be relevant for our physical understanding</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h02m52s">of the make-up of atomic and subatomic particles,
but they’re definitely relevant to whether</a>
00:02:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h02m57s">we can walk across the street safely.</a>
00:02:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h03m00s">I would say if you’re related to reality
properly, the kind of information that you’re</a>
00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h03m08s">processing is precisely the kind of information
that allows you to cross the street properly;</a>
00:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h03m12s">and to do all the other things during your
days, your weeks, your months that you have</a>
00:03:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h03m16s">to in order to stay alive and fundamentally,
in some sense, propagate.</a>
00:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h03m22s">Alright, so we’ll start with the neuropsychological
argument.</a>
00:03:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h03m26s">Now we’ve already established the idea that
these little frames of reference, or maps,</a>
00:03:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h03m32s">or stories, or whatever you call them – I’ll
call them stories from hereon in, are little</a>
00:03:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h03m40s">gold-directed units.</a>
00:03:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h03m42s">They’re units of conception and emotion
and perception and behavior; they’re little</a>
00:03:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h03m47s">sub-personalities.</a>
00:03:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h03m50s">The sub-personality has an initial starting
point and a destination point, and then it</a>
00:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h03m56s">implements behaviors to transform the starting
point into the destination point.</a>
00:03:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h04m01s">Then you might say, well what forms these
little sub-personalities?</a>
00:04:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h04m05s">The answer to that is very complex, but one
answer is: fundamental motivations.</a>
00:04:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h04m11s">I arranged the fundamental motivations on
this particular diagram pointing out that</a>
00:04:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h04m20s">you can roughly consider motivations, as those
that maintain you, and those that propagate</a>
00:04:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h04m26s">you.</a>
00:04:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h04m27s">Now it’s just a heuristic, it’s just a
way of thinking about it.</a>
00:04:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h04m32s">Under self-maintenance there’s thermal regulation,
thirst, hunger and elimination, and there’s</a>
00:04:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h04m36s">all sorts of other things as well, but those
will do for the time being.</a>
00:04:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h04m39s">Under self-propagation there’s affiliative
desire and sexual desire.</a>
00:04:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h04m43s">The things that’s quite interesting about
all of this is that there are brain structures</a>
00:04:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h04m52s">that underlie the manifestation of these fundamental
sub-personalities.</a>
00:04:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h04m57s">Now people tend to think about them either
as motivations or emotions, and I think that’s</a>
00:04:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h05m03s">another useful heuristic.</a>
00:05:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h05m05s">You can say that, roughly speaking, that a
motivation pops up an entire frame of reference</a>
00:05:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h05m10s">and emotion tends to orient you within that
frame of reference.</a>
00:05:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h05m14s">But that’s only a conceptual simplification,
because what you see when look at the actual</a>
00:05:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h05m20s">brain structures is that there isn’t an
emotion center – there are a bunch of micro-units</a>
00:05:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h05m27s">in the brain, and there are separable micro-units
for different emotions and different motivations</a>
00:05:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h05m35s">and they don’t necessarily have that much
in common in terms of their locale, except</a>
00:05:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h05m40s">that they tend to be relatively deep in the
brain.</a>
00:05:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h05m43s">Some are hypothalamic and some are in the
amygdala, and some are in the periaqueductal</a>
00:05:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h05m47s">grey, which seems to be responsible for pain
responses.</a>
00:05:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h05m50s">So we can classify things as motivations and
emotions, but it doesn’t map one-to-one</a>
00:05:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h05m55s">on the underlying brain structure.</a>
00:05:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h05m59s">Now I think what we’ll do with regards to
talking about the brain is we’ll start from</a>
00:05:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h06m03s">the bottom up.</a>
00:06:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h06m04s">It’s appropriate to start from the bottom
up because you are more dependent on your</a>
00:06:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h06m09s">ancient brain structures than you are on your
modern brain structures; in that, if you damage</a>
00:06:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h06m15s">your modern brain structures, and I mean relatively
modern, let’s say the ones that have really</a>
00:06:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h06m20s">evolved in great detail over the last two
million years, the cortical cap, in particular,</a>
00:06:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h06m25s">the prefrontal cortex, a lot of the visual
cortex.</a>
00:06:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h06m28s">If you damage that you can pretty much go
on.</a>
00:06:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h06m31s">Now you’re going to have one impairment
or another impairment, but you can still stay</a>

00:06:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h06m35s">However, there are structures that are lower
down that if you damage, that’s the end</a>
00:06:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h06m40s">of you.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h14m17s">but of course the problem with the brain is,
you know, it’s pattern one at this level</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h15m45s">What’s going on?</a>

00:15:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h15m49s">Okay, so all of these little nuclei in the
hypothalamus, they’re all doing slightly</a>
00:15:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h15m57s">different things, they’re radically different

00:16:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h16m03s">So, roughly what you could say is that one
half of the hypothalamus is devoted to popping</a>
00:16:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h16m08s">up little sub-personalities that are devoted
to the satisfaction of fundamental biological</a>
00:16:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h16m19s">requirements.</a>
00:16:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h16m21s">It’s not obvious what a fundamental biological
requirement is, because that’s a heuristic,</a>
00:16:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h16m28s">it’s not a category, it’s a fuzzy category,
but we can agree on some of its contents.</a>
00:16:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h16m35s">So of course thirst, hunger and the need to
breathe would be in there, and might also</a>
00:16:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h16m39s">add pain, and sexual desire and the need for
play, although that’s a separate circuit</a>
00:16:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h16m46s">and it’s not mediated by hypothalamic structures,
there’s a different circuit for play.</a>
00:16:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h16m51s">Play slash affiliation.</a>
00:16:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h16m56s">Roughly speaking what an animal basically
chases and requires on a day-today and week-to-week</a>
00:16:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h17m04s">basis is mediated in large part by the hypothalamus.</a>
00:17:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h17m07s">And the hypothalamus is also a crucial nexus
in the brain for identifying what’s going</a>
00:17:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h17m14s">on in the body and then telling the brain
what to do about it.</a>
00:17:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h17m18s">So for example the hypothalamus is the thing
that makes you hungry and the thing that makes</a>
00:17:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h17m21s">you thirsty.</a>
00:17:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h17m22s">It does that because it monitors levels of
substances such as sugar in your bloodstream,</a>
00:17:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h17m29s">and also the degree to which you’re hydrated.</a>
00:17:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h17m35s">You can sustain tiny little bits of damage
to the hypothalamus, which has unbelievably</a>
00:17:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h17m40s">extreme consequences.</a>
00:17:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h17m42s">So for example, if you get unlucky, you can
develop hyper aphasia or, uncontrollable thirst.</a>
00:17:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h17m50s">If that part of your hypothalamus is damaged,
people just can’t keep you away from water</a>
00:17:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h17m56s">supplies, you’ll just drink and drink and
drink and drink until you drown.</a>
00:17:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h18m01s">You can’t control it.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h18m02s">So the hypothalamus is no joke and hyperphagia
is the same thing, except in relationship</a>

rage system.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h18m41s">I knew someone who had a seizure condition
like that.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h18m49s">Now this guy has quite an interesting story.</a>
00:18:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h18m53s">So it first happened to him when he was about
eighteen.</a>
00:18:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h18m57s">He was out drinking in a bar.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h18m58s">Now, alcohol lowers your seizure threshold.</a>
00:18:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h19m02s">So he’s out drinking in a bar and all of
a sudden he got up and tore his shirt off.</a>
00:19:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h19m09s">He was in an aggressive stance and backed
into the corner, and his friends were coming</a>
00:19:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h19m13s">towards him.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h19m14s">He told them to go away or I’ll hit you.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h19m17s">Now he was a very well socialized person,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h19m32s">got close enough.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h19m33s">So anyways, I believe at that point he slapped
a police officer who came to rescue him.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h19m38s">They took him to the hospital and on the way
there he hit his fingers against the hood</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h19m44s">of the car and put dents in it, and then when
he got to the hospital – now I don’t remember</a>

up a kidney bowl, which is like an enamel</a>

00:20:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h20m07s">that someone had spiked his alcohol with some
sort of drug, but that was never demonstrated.</a>
00:20:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h20m13s">He got off of all that because he had no record,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h20m36s">Then after that he had EEG testing, which
showed that he was susceptible to seizures</a>
00:20:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h20m41s">so he swore off alcohol.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h23m13s">you think how Piaget talked about how children

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h29m20s">In some sense what we’re talking about when

00:29:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h29m30s">So you’ve got this rat and it’s behaviors
are all chained together.</a>
00:29:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h29m33s">So I already told you, I spoiled the story

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h29m39s">One of the earlier demonstrations of the independence
of rat learning from the reflex of conditioning</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h29m45s">was that - so let’s say you’ve trained
a rat to run down a maze.</a>
00:29:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h29m48s">Okay so hypothetically it’s using it’s
front legs and it’s back legs and it’s</a>
00:29:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h29m53s">learned to chain all of that together.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h29m55s">“Front leg, back leg, movement, turn left.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h29m59s">Etc.” so then, what if you put the rat,
you tie up it’s back legs and you put him</a>
00:29:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h30m04s">in a little rat wheel barrel, so it’s got

00:30:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h30m10s">So much for the reflex theory because obviously
you didn’t train the rat to use a cart with</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h30m17s">it’s rear-end stuck in it, it figured that
out all by itself.</a>
00:30:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h30m21s">So anyways there is a system in you that allows
you to chain reflexes together.</a>
00:30:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h30m26s">It’s a very primordial reflex system and
the behaviorists got that right.</a>
00:30:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h30m30s">It’s fast, very very fast, because it requires
few neural connections.</a>
00:30:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h30m35s">So there are some advantages to simple learning
but once you get up to even the moderately</a>
00:30:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h30m42s">higher cortical and sub-cortical functions,
you’re past the point of mere reflex chaining.</a>
00:30:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h30m49s">Okay so, let’s for the sake of simplicity
the hypothalamus says, you need water.</a>
00:30:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h30m55s">So you’re current state is that you’re
thirsty and you’re desired state is you</a>

and some fantasies of drinking water start</a>

you’re kind of possessed by that.</a>
00:31:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h31m09s">So it’s starting to interfere with your
conscious goal-directed behavior at that point,</a>
00:31:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=00h31m15s">and finally it’s insistent enough like something
knocking at the door so you think, man I’m</a>

it needs a little impurity or shock or something</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h28m37s">So then if you take a little crystal of sugar
and you drop it in, it’s like it goes “sound”</a>
01:28:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h28m40s">and instantly it’s all crystals.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h28m44s">So that’s what happened to this kid: he
was there, he was ready, he had to answer,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h28m49s">and all I had to do was say you could do something
about this and “poof!” instant hero myth.</a>
01:28:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h28m55s">The cool thing is no more night terrors.</a>
01:28:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h29m01s">So you get the picture, it’s very, very
cool.</a>
01:29:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h29m05s">Alright so, back to our discussion.</a>
01:29:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h29m09s">Now, alright so you’ve got the brain here.</a>
01:29:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h29m24s">This is the brain as conceptualized by Alexander
Luria, who was Russia’s most famous neuropsychologist.</a>
01:29:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h29m37s">So basically he said that there’s a bunch
of different ways you can divide up the brain.</a>
01:29:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h29m42s">It depends on what you want, which is an interesting
way of thinking about it.</a>
01:29:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h29m46s">Because you might say well how should you
divide up the world and the answer is it depends</a>
01:29:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h29m50s">on what you want.</a>
01:29:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h29m52s">It depends on some degree of the world, but
it depends even more </a>
01:29:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h29m57s">So one of the things Luria said was if you
go from the back to the front of the brain</a>
01:29:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h30m02s">– the front’s the grey part here – what
you see is, roughly speaking, the back half</a>
01:30:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h30m07s">of the brain does sensory processing, especially
visual processing, and the front half of the</a>
01:30:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h30m12s">brain does motor processing.</a>
01:30:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h30m14s">Okay, and so if you look at the back of the
brain the sensory unit there, you see there’s</a>
01:30:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h30m18s">an auditory area and a visual area.</a>
01:30:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h30m21s">What’s cool is those overlap to some degree.</a>
01:30:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h30m24s">So there’s some hypothesis that the place
where the sensory systems overlap are the</a>
01:30:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h30m29s">parts that are responsible for your experience
of a unified perceptual field.</a>
01:30:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h30m34s">So here’s an example: imagine the visual
cortex and the auditory cortex overlap in</a>
01:30:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h30m39s">once place.</a>
01:30:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h30m40s">Okay, so it would sort of be here, about there
on the left side.</a>
01:30:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h30m45s">That’s the part you use for silent reading.</a>
01:30:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h30m48s">Isn’t that cool?</a>
01:30:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h30m50s">It means your using your eyes as ears.</a>
01:30:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h30m52s">The way you do that is you use the overlap
between the visual and the auditory cortex.</a>
01:30:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h30m56s">It’s so cool, you can use your eyes as ears.</a>
01:30:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h31m00s">So the senses aren’t as separate as people
think.</a>
01:31:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h31m03s">I used to wear glasses and I couldn’t hear
what people were saying when I wasn’t wearing</a>
01:31:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h31m07s">them.</a>
01:31:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h31m08s">The reason for that is I wasn’t watching
their lips.</a>
01:31:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h31m10s">So a lot of what I was hearing in language
processing was the expression on their face</a>
01:31:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h31m14s">and the movement of their lips.</a>
01:31:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h31m15s">I take off my glasses, and I’m deaf.</a>
01:31:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h31m18s">So anyways, that’s the sensory unit, half
of the brain.</a>
01:31:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h31m21s">Most of it’s the visual cortex because we’re
visual creatures.</a>
01:31:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h31m24s">The front half is the motor unit.</a>
01:31:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h31m26s">Okay, why?</a>
01:31:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h31m27s">Well because we proceed and act.</a>
01:31:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h31m31s">So it’s the part of the brain that’s responsible
for zipping you around.</a>
01:31:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h31m34s">You’ve got voluntary action, right?</a>
01:31:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h31m36s">You inhabit a nervous system that enables
you to navigate your way around the world.</a>
01:31:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h31m43s">We’re navigators, fundamentally.</a>
01:31:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h31m44s">We really are navigators.</a>
01:31:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h31m48s">You know ants can navigate by the stars?</a>
01:31:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h31m51s">Think about that.</a>
01:31:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h31m52s">How the hell can an ant navigate by the stars?</a>
01:31:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h31m54s">They figured that out by watching ants figure
out how to get back, and then covering up</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h31m59s">the sky, and then the ants would wander around
not knowing where they were going.</a>
01:31:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h32m03s">Yeah there’s lots of things we don’t understand,
I can tell you that.</a>
01:32:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h32m07s">So anyways, the motor unit.</a>
01:32:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h32m08s">You’ve got the motor strip.</a>
01:32:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h32m11s">Now if you touch that with an electrode during
brain surgery then people will either move</a>
01:32:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h32m15s">or have the impulse to move and you can map
out how the body is represented in the brain</a>
01:32:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h32m20s">by touching that strip with an electrode,
and that was done by Wilmer Penfield at the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h32m25s">It was a major move forward in the understanding
of the brain and he did that on epileptics</a>
01:32:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h32m31s">before surgery, because he didn’t want to
take out parts of the brain that were necessary</a>
01:32:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h32m35s">so he was trying to figure out what they were
doing.</a>
01:32:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h32m37s">So that’s the part that enables you to act
voluntarily, and in front of that there’s</a>
01:32:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h32m42s">the premotor strip.</a>
01:32:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h32m44s">In front of that there’s the prefrontal
cortex.</a>
01:32:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h32m47s">Now, what’s cool is that the premotor strip
and the prefrontal cortex grew out of the</a>

01:32:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h32m56s">So then you might say, well why do we think?</a>
01:32:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h32m59s">The answer isn’t so that we can come up
with accurate, objective representations of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h33m04s">The answer is, so that we can plan what to
do.</a>
01:33:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h33m07s">What you see, fundamentally, is that as you
move forward in the brain you go from action</a>
01:33:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h33m14s">to planning action.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHmklvx9oJ4#t=01h33m16s">So by the time you get to the prefrontal cortex,
let’s say the dorsal-lateral prefrontal</a>
