<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h00m14s">Maybe they've been isolated or maybe they just haven't been able to engage in Physical activity like many school children</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h00m30s">And you can measure how hard he wants how hard it he'll pull the go out and play or how [many] buttons he'll push you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h00m35s">Know and that gives you an indication of his motivation so anyways</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h00m39s">You can see that the play deprived Juvenile rat will fight harder to play than [a] [non] play deprived</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h00m56s">You're going to poke and prod out them to see what sort of things they're willing to</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h01m05s">It's a measurement device, and if they're willing to overcome a bunch of your objections then you think oh well</a>
00:01:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h01m10s">Maybe they really want to and that's another weird thing to really know if there's something you want you</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h01m16s">need about five arguments about why you want it because the</a>
00:01:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h01m20s">Probability that the person who's opposing you will have five arguments about why you shouldn't have it is very low</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h01m26s">They just won't have thought it through enough. So the other thing that happens in the future authoring exercise</a>
00:01:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h01m31s">is that you're asked to articulate the reasons for all the goals that come out [of] your</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h01m36s">Vision of the [future], so you're asked like why would it be good for you? Why would it be good for your family?</a>
00:01:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h01m41s">Why would it be good for broader society so that gives you three levels of argumentation right there if you have it?</a>
00:01:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h01m47s">Articulated down into detail and it's related to other important goals</a>
00:01:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h01m51s">Then you're you're a hell of a thing to argue with because people just aren't that deep by which I mean</a>
00:01:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h01m57s">They just don't have that many levels of explanation or objection</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h02m01s">and it's also really useful in relationship to your own mind because if you want to do something, that's</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h02m06s">[difficult] and that requires energy a lot of different subsystems in your mind are going to throw up objections. It's like well</a>
00:02:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h02m13s">Maybe that isn't what you should be doing right now</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h02m14s">Maybe you should be doing the dishes or vacuuming or watching TV or looking at Youtube or if you're really sneaky?</a>
00:02:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h02m21s">When you're trying to do something hard what your brain does [is] give you something else hard to do</a>
00:02:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h02m25s">That's not quite as hard so that you can feel</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h02m27s">justified and not doing the thing you're supposed to because you're doing something else useful and if you give in to that temptation</a>
00:02:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h02m33s">Which you often will then it wins and because it wins it gets a little dopamine kick, and it grows stronger</a>
00:02:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h02m39s">Everything anything you let win the internal argument</a>
00:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h02m43s">Grows and anything you let be defeated shrinks because it's punished</a>
00:02:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h02m48s">it doesn't get to have its way, so that's another thing really to remember don't practice what you do not want to become and</a>
00:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h02m56s">Because those are their neurological circuits you build those [things] in [they're] mad, they're they're not going anywhere</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h03m02s">You can build another little machine to inhibit them that's the best you can do once they're in there</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h03m07s">You can't get them out</a>
00:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h03m08s">So and then the ones you build to inhibit can be taken out by stress and the old habits will come back up</a>
00:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnqnCi0j_8#t=00h03m14s">So you've got to be careful what you say and what you do because you you build yourself that way</a>
