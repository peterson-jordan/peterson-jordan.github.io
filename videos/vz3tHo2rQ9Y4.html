00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h00m03s">And you can say, "I'm not ready." Yeah fine.</a>
00:00:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h00m08s">Unsurprising, especially if you were too protected as a child.</a>
00:00:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h00m11s">it is not a good idea to protect children too much,</a>
00:00:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h00m13s">because snakes enter the garden anyway,</a>
00:00:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h00m17s">so instead of driving away the snakes</a>
00:00:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h00m21s">you need to arm your child with something that will help them chop the snakes into pieces.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h00m25s">And make them a world.</a>
00:00:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h00m27s">The trick for people to flourish in the face of suffering and evil is strength, not protection.</a>
00:00:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h00m34s">It's something else entirely. We also know this in practice.</a>
00:00:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h00m37s">For example, we know that when you treat agoraphobia by exposure,</a>
00:00:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h00m42s">which is, roughly speaking, a fear of chaos, a fear of everything.</a>
00:00:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h00m47s">You don't want them to be less afraid, but to be braver. "</a>
00:00:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h00m50s">It's not the same because agoraphobics have this problem:</a>
00:00:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h00m56s">They cannot imagine death and suffering.</a>
00:00:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h00m58s">They are naive that, it does not exist in the theater of their imagination,</a>
00:00:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h01m02s">because they are protected from it.</a>
00:01:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h01m04s">But then something happens, this often happens to women in their forties,</a>
00:01:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h01m08s">because they most often develop agoraphobia.</a>
00:01:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h01m12s">Something will happen, the authorities have protected them from chaos for life.</a>
00:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h01m16s">So maybe they had too protective a father</a>
00:01:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h01m19s">and they switched to an overprotecting friend and then to a husband</a>
00:01:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h01m23s">and perhaps they were willing to surrender to all three for that protection.</a>
00:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h01m29s">Such is the agreement - they will remain weak and dependent, but they may have to</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h01m34s">because that is the only way to attract a person who is hyperprotective.</a>
00:01:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h01m37s">But the price behind it is that they are not strong enough.</a>
00:01:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h01m41s">And then something happens in their lives, often after forty,</a>
00:01:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h01m44s">they develop heart palpitations, possibly as a result of menopause.</a>
00:01:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h01m48s">Their hearts start beating furiously and they think they are going to die.</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h01m52s">Well, who are you talking to about this, right?</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h01m55s">Authority will not save you from this.</a>
00:01:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h01m58s">Or maybe their friends are divorcing or their sister dies or something.</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h02m02s">It will evoke the specter of mortality and perhaps the specter of evil and mortality.</a>
00:02:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h02m07s">And so that an escape to authority cannot solve it.</a>
00:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h02m11s">And so they have a panic attack.</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h02m13s">They go out, frightened, feel their hearts beating,</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h02m16s">then he is frightened because of his heart, because he thinks, "I will die now."</a>
00:02:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h02m20s">And they will say to themselves:</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h02m21s">"I'm going to die and make a fool of myself because I'm going to get a lot of attention."</a>
00:02:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h02m26s">So two big fears arise: death and public embarrassment.</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h02m30s">Then they have a panic attack, primitive impulses get out of control.</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h02m34s">Very annoying.</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h02m36s">Then they start avoiding places where they had a panic attack</a>
00:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h02m38s">and in the end they can't go anywhere.</a>
00:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h02m41s">Tiamat returned. Big monster, small victim.</a>
00:02:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h02m46s">And what will you do with them?</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h02m48s">You cannot say that Tiamat does not exist.</a>
00:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h02m51s">It is not possible. They are no longer naive.</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h02m55s">They had direct contact with the threat of death and social justice.</a>
00:02:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h02m59s">They met a terrible mother and a terrible father and there is no going back.</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h03m04s">You can't say "The world is safe."</a>
00:03:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h03m07s">It's not safe at all. It's not safe.</a>
00:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h03m11s">If you think he's safe, you live in a naive bubble,</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h03m14s">provided by culture. It's a gift.</a>
00:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h03m19s">And now she's shattered, and what do you do now?</a>
00:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h03m23s">You hide at home and you can't go anywhere.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h03m26s">You are a petrified rabbit.</a>
00:03:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h03m29s">And life is hell because you can't work.</a>
00:03:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h03m32s">The alternative is: let's break down the things you're afraid of.</a>
00:03:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h03m36s">We will expose you to them. Carefully and sequentially.</a>
00:03:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h03m41s">And then you learn you're tougher than you thought.</a>
00:03:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h03m46s">You didn't know that! And maybe you didn't want to take that responsibility,</a>
00:03:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h03m50s">because people are the creators of their misfortune.</a>
00:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h03m53s">When you had the opportunity to go out and explore</a>
00:03:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h03m57s">or to fear with fear, you have chosen to download with fear.</a>
00:03:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h04m01s">It's not just that you've been overprotected,</a>
00:04:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h04m03s">you were often willing to take advantage of being protected</a>
00:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h04m08s">and you ran away whenever you could.</a>
00:04:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h04m11s">Maybe you were a child on the playground and you had a problem with other children.</a>
00:04:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h04m14s">And deep in your mind, you know you should do it yourself.</a>
00:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h04m19s">But you go and tell Mom and you let her hit.</a>
00:04:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h04m21s">And you know that's not right.</a>
00:04:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h04m23s">You know you're breaking the social rule, but it's easier.</a>
00:04:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h04m26s">So you run to authority and hide behind a big daddy, right?</a>
00:04:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h04m33s">The problem is that you will not learn it yourself.</a>
00:04:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h04m36s">And then you have to learn it painfully when you're 40.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h04m39s">So you go out with people.</a>
00:04:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h04m41s">You say, "What are you afraid of? Number it 1-10."</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h04m45s">Make a list of 10 things you are afraid of.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h04m51s">10 is what you are least afraid of. Let's start with that. "I'm afraid of elevators"</a>
00:04:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h04m55s">Okay, let's look at the picture of the elevator.</a>
00:04:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h04m58s">Imagine you are in an elevator.</a>
00:04:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h05m01s">Go out and see how those horrible jaws of death open,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h05m05s">because that's how you react symbolically.</a>
00:05:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h05m08s">And you will go as close as you can.</a>
00:05:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h05m14s">You go and it works. You are very nervous,</a>
00:05:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h05m18s">especially because of expectations.</a>
00:05:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h05m21s">You shake, you go outside, you stop, you look and you calm down.</a>
00:05:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h05m25s">You do it ten times and you're fine.</a>
00:05:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h05m28s">You've learned that you won't die, but more importantly,</a>
00:05:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h05m32s">you have learned that you can withstand the threat of death.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h05m37s">And then you go a little closer, and then a little closer</a>
00:05:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h05m40s">And in the end you are back in what is not an elevator, symbolically it is a tomb</a>
00:05:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h05m47s">It is a closed and isolated place.</a>
00:05:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h05m50s">And you learn, "Hmm, it turns out I can handle it."</a>
00:05:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h05m54s">And then you're more together, much more confident.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h05m58s">And what often happens in such situations,</a>
00:05:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h06m01s">I've seen it several times,</a>
00:06:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h06m04s">When someone goes through this process of exposing and roughening,</a>
00:06:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h06m09s">it often begins to build on other people like never before,</a>
00:06:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h06m13s">because he couldn't stand up for himself,</a>
00:06:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h06m16s">because he didn't want to undermine the protection.</a>
00:06:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h06m20s">When you protect me, I can't resist you,</a>
00:06:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h06m24s">because I can't afford to lose your protection.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h06m28s">So if I play this, I'll hide behind you,</a>
00:06:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h06m31s">then I can't question you.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h06m33s">That's not good because ...</a>
00:06:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h06m35s">you often see it in men,</a>
00:06:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h06m39s">they are still afraid of the father's opinion to death when they are 30-40.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h06m44s">Why?</a>
00:06:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h06m45s">Because they want to believe that someone outside "knows".</a>
00:06:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h06m48s">and so they are willing to accept that subordination,</a>
00:06:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h06m51s">because it doesn't force them to question the idea that there is someone out there who knows.</a>
00:06:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h06m55s">Because that's the father's advantage as a judge, isn't it?</a>
00:06:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h06m59s">He knows.</a>
00:06:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h07m00s">And what if not?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h07m01s">What if someone doesn't know better than you? Well, that's hard.</a>
00:07:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h07m06s">Until you realize it, you're not an adult, are you?</a>
00:07:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h07m09s">This is technically the point when you reach adulthood.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h07m12s">When no one knows what you should do better than you.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h07m16s">It's a terrible finding, because what the hell do you know?</a>
00:07:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h07m19s">It's a terrible finding and people often choose slavery ...</a>
00:07:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h07m23s">Permanent bondage of the spirit of the great father before that discovery, and it is understandable.</a>
00:07:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h07m29s">But the problem with that is that you have more than you think</a>
00:07:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h07m32s">and when you hide behind that person,</a>
00:07:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h07m35s">you will never have a chance to understand that there is more in you than you think</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h07m39s">much more than you think.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h07m41s">Maybe there's so much in you</a>
00:07:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h07m42s">that you will withstand the threat of death without putting it on you.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h07m48s">You may even withstand the threat of evil without putting it down.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h07m51s">Who knows? It is definitely possible.</a>
00:07:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h07m54s">And it's not an abstract question.</a>
00:07:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h07m56s">It's exactly the kind of question you address during psychotherapy.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h08m02s">You always address this question and the answer is often yes.</a>
00:08:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h08m07s">Because people can be incredibly hard.</a>
00:08:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h08m09s">And you know that because people work in hospital emergency rooms</a>
00:08:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h08m13s">or work in palliative care or mortuaries.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h08m18s">These people have a damn hard job.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h08m26s">so they regularly encounter evil,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h08m29s">These are very stressful jobs, but people do them,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h08m33s">Some people even do them without harming them.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h08m37s">But it's harder because you can see scary things</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tHo2rQ9Y4#t=00h08m40s">that you will never forget.</a>
