00:57:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHZjcfgk4CI#t=00h58m00s">well then I could bring the needle close

00:58:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHZjcfgk4CI#t=00h58m12s">unsheathed it and I'd bring it close and

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHZjcfgk4CI#t=00h58m16s">I touch him with that and then the last

00:58:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHZjcfgk4CI#t=00h58m35s">well what had happened he got what had

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHZjcfgk4CI#t=00h59m00s">different and so like I had a client
once the doors open on the elevator and</a>
00:59:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHZjcfgk4CI#t=00h59m03s">she looked and she said that's death

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHZjcfgk4CI#t=00h59m14s">walking in there was death right okay so
