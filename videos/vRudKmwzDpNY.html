00:00:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h00m15s">then, hopefully, some of the things that I'm going to say, that are more technical, will make more sense</a>
00:00:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h00m22s">and so, what we're going to do today, at least in part, is to deal with...</a>
00:00:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h00m26s">to start to deal with conceptualizing a solution</a>
00:00:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h00m32s">to the fact that the world is too complex to properly perceive</a>
00:00:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h00m37s">so what the problem fundamentally is is that there's a lot more of everything else than there is of you</a>
00:00:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h00m43s">especially if you include in that everything else, all the parts of you that you also don't understand</a>
00:00:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h00m50s">and so...</a>
00:00:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h00m53s">I want to walk you through how I think we solve that, at least in part</a>
00:00:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h00m58s">and we do that by, essentially by simplifying the world, but</a>
00:00:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h01m02s">I think mostly that we simplify it as a place in which to act, rather than a place in which to perceive objects</a>
00:01:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h01m12s">and I really believe that there's a critical distinction between those two things</a>
00:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h01m17s">and I think that part of the reason that there's been continual tension</a>
00:01:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h01m22s">say, between the claims of science and, let's say, the claims of religion</a>
00:01:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h01m26s">is because the idea that the world as a place of objects and as a place to act have to be considered separately, isn't properly understood</a>
00:01:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h01m37s">I don't know...</a>
00:01:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h01m39s">so I'm gonna try to straighten that up to the degree that that's possible</a>
00:01:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h01m44s">so, I'm gonna talk to you about stories and meta-stories</a>
00:01:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h01m47s">and the story, I would say, is the simplest unit of useful information</a>
00:01:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h01m53s">with regards to action and perception that you can be offered</a>
00:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h01m57s">and then a meta-story is a story about how a story like that transforms</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h02m01s">and I would say...</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h02m04s">we'll concentrate on the structure of the story</a>
00:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h02m09s">and then we'll get into the structure of the meta-story, and</a>
00:02:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h02m13s">that'll constitute today's... today's class</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h02m18s">so the first thing I wanna show you... I know many of you have seen this, but I'm gonna show it anyways</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h02m25s">for the longest time it was presumed that...</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h02m31s">for the longest time, say, at least in the 20th century</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h02m34s">it was presumed that we make a pretty complete model of the world</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h02m40s">and then we act in the world, and we compare what happens to that model</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h02m45s">and as long as our model and the world are matching</a>
00:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h02m53s">then, roughly speaking, we believe that everything is okay, and our emotions stay under control</a>
00:02:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h03m01s">but if that model mismatches, then we know that something's up</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h03m07s">now, a lot of this work was done by Russians, especially in the early 60s</a>
00:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h03m12s">by two Russian scientists, Vinogradova and Sokolov</a>
00:03:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h03m18s">who were students of Alexander Luria, who was arguably the greatest neuropsychologist of the 20th century</a>
00:03:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h03m25s">Luria spent a lot of time studying soldiers from WW2 that had received head injuries</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h03m31s">of various sorts, and because of that he could draw inferences about how the brain worked</a>
00:03:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h03m35s">and some of what we're going to talk about over the upcoming weeks with regards to brain function</a>
00:03:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h03m41s">much of it is predicated on Luria's work</a>
00:03:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h03m43s">Sokolov and Vinogradova were his students, and they were interested in this phenomena...</a>
00:03:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h03m48s">they were interested in psychophysiological measurement, right</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h03m52s">as a way of inferring brain function</a>
00:03:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h03m54s">so psychophysiological measurement is measurement of those physiological parameters</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h03m59s">say, like pupil width, or skin conductance, or EEG</a>
00:03:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h04m05s">that are in some ways directly reflective of how the brain works</a>
00:04:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h04m09s">now, if you measure skin resistance, skin resistance changes with the amount that you sweat</a>
00:04:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h04m16s">that can change very, very rapidly, and it changes in response to physiological demands placed on your body</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h04m24s">so, for example, if your body assumes that you're going to leap into action for some purpose</a>
00:04:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h04m30s">and it's gonna open up your pores to prepare you to keep yourself cool</a>
00:04:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h04m33s">and you can measure those transformations quite accurately by measuring the electrical resistance of the skin</a>
00:04:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h04m39s">and so what you see, if you put someone in a lab chair</a>
00:04:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h04m45s">and you expose themselves to different stimuli, you find that...</a>
00:04:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h04m48s">for example you can expose them to something that's threatening</a>
00:04:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h04m51s">say, like a picture of a snake, then their skin conductance will decrease, because they're...</a>
00:04:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h04m57s">sorry, their skin conductance will increase, because they sweat a little bit more</a>
00:04:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h05m01s">and it's quite a rapid response, it can be a very rapid response</a>
00:05:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h05m05s">now, one of the things that Sokolov...</a>
00:05:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h05m12s">yeah, that's right... noted was that if he...</a>
00:05:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h05m16s">if I sat you down, for example, and I put some headphones on you</a>
00:05:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h05m20s">and I played a tone to you that repeated, exactly the same tone that repeated at predictable intervals</a>
00:05:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h05m26s">that the first time you heard the tone you'd produce quite a spike in skin conductance</a>
00:05:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h05m30s">and the next time a slightly smaller spike, and then the next time a slightly smaller spike</a>
00:05:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h05m35s">until after maybe you've heard it three or four times, you would not respond to it at all</a>
00:05:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h05m40s">and that was often regarded as habituation</a>
00:05:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h05m44s">and habituations is the same thing that you can see in snails, for example</a>
00:05:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h05m48s">and I'm using snails as an example, because they have very, very simple nervous systems</a>
00:05:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h05m53s">so if you take a snail and you poke it, then...</a>
00:05:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h05m56s">like it comes out of its shell and you poke it, it'll go back into its shell</a>
00:05:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h05m59s">and then it'll come out, and if you poke it again it'll go back into its shell</a>
00:05:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h06m03s">and it'll come out; but if you keep doing that, sooner or later the snail will just stop going in</a>
00:06:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h06m07s">and you might think of that... it has been conceptualized as the simplest form of learning</a>
00:06:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h06m12s">habituation</a>
00:06:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h06m14s">and the behaviorists tend to presume that if a human being manifested a response that could be modeled by a simple organism</a>
00:06:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h06m22s">then the human being was using a response that was analogous to that of the simple organism</a>
00:06:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h06m26s">and sometimes that's true, and sometimes it's not, so...</a>
00:06:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h06m30s">for example, you have simple reflexes that, you know</a>
00:06:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h06m33s">if you put your hand on a hot stove, you'll jerk back, and that's quite a simple circuit</a>
00:06:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h06m37s">you'll move your hand back before the message gets to your brain</a>
00:06:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h06m40s">because the spinal cord is smart enough to mediate a reflex like that all by itself</a>
00:06:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h06m46s">so you know, your brains is actually quite distributed throughout your body, it's not just in your head like people tend to think</a>
00:06:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h06m52s">and so, we have conserved fast-acting reflexes at various levels of our nervous system</a>
00:06:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h07m01s">they aren't capable of sophisticated response, it's pretty much stimulus - response</a>
00:07:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h07m07s">thinking about it from the behavioral perspective</a>
00:07:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h07m09s">but they have as an advantage incredible speed, because they're just aren't that many neural connections between the stimulus and the response</a>
00:07:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h07m16s">and so, we have layers of response at different time frames</a>
00:07:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h07m21s">that help us match with the demands of the external environment</a>
00:07:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h07m26s">so Charles Darwin, for example, used to go into the, I think it was a museum in England, I don't remember the name of it</a>
00:07:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h07m31s">the snake in there, I believe it was a cobra,</a>
00:07:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h07m34s">and he'd stick his face up at the glass, and the cobra would strike at him</a>
00:07:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h07m37s">and he'd jerk back; and he tried many, many times to master that reflexive response to the snake, but there was no way</a>
00:07:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h07m44s">every time that thing struck at him, he'd jump backwards</a>
00:07:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h07m47s">well, you can imagine the survival utility in a reflex like that, but in reflexes in general</a>
00:07:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h07m53s">okay, so back to Sokolov</a>
00:07:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h07m56s">now, what he decided...</a>
00:07:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h07m59s">if you took that tone, and you did anything to it that was perceptible</a>
00:07:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h08m03s">right, because there's certain gradations of tone that you're not capable of perceiving</a>
00:08:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h08m08s">but let's assume you took the tone, and you would adjust it enough so that it was perceptibly louder</a>
00:08:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h08m12s">or it was perceptibly a different frequency, or something like that</a>
00:08:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h08m16s">or even that the spaces between the tones</a>
00:08:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h08m19s">'cause I said they were predictably spaced</a>
00:08:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h08m21s">even if the spaces between the tones were changed</a>
00:08:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h08m25s">then, when the change occurred, the orienting reflex would be reinstated, you'd respond to it again</a>
00:08:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h08m31s">and Sokolov tried to vary the tone on many, many parameters</a>
00:08:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h08m36s">but no matter what parameter he varied it on, as long as you could detect it perceptibly</a>
00:08:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h08m42s">you'd produce an orienting reflex; so Sokolov's idea was that</a>
00:08:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h08m45s">you must be producing a complex internal model of the world</a>
00:08:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h08m50s">that's in concordance with the world across pretty much every perceptible dimension</a>
00:08:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h08m54s">because if you weren't doing that, how in the world would you know that the tone had changed from what you had already learned about it?</a>
00:08:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h09m01s">and so, for the longest time, and this was also true for people who were investigating artificial intelligence</a>
00:09:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h09m07s">we had this idea that what people did was make a complex model of the world, and hold it in their minds, so to speak</a>
00:09:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h09m14s">and then they'd act in the world, and they compared what they expected to happen in the world with the model</a>
00:09:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h09m20s">and as long as there was a match, then there was no orienting reflex</a>
00:09:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h09m23s">now, the orienting reflex turns out to be quite a complex reflex, it's not merely an alteration in skin conductance</a>
00:09:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h09m29s">what it is in essence is the manner in which you start to unfold your response to the unknown</a>
00:09:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h09m36s">and the initial stages of that are very, very quick</a>
00:09:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h09m39s">but it's hard to tell when the orienting reflex stops, and when more complex learning begins</a>
00:09:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h09m46s">they sort of shade into one another</a>
00:09:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h09m48s">so the initial stages of the orienting reflex are quite reflexive</a>
00:09:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h09m51s">but the later stages can be extraordinarily complex, so for example...</a>
00:09:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h10m03s">well, I always think the example of betrayal is the best one, because it's so complex</a>
00:10:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h10m09s">so imagine that you know, you come home and you find evidence, lipstick or something like that</a>
00:10:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h10m15s">evidence that the person that you're with is betraying you</a>
00:10:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h10m19s">the first thing that's going to happen is that you're going to orient, there's going to be a real shock, and that's reflexive</a>
00:10:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h10m24s">it's very much akin to the response that you would manifest if you saw a predator, or a snake, or something like that</a>
00:10:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h10m31s">so that's very instantaneous, you know</a>
00:10:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h10m34s">and then that'll prepare you for action, you'll get ready to do whatever it is that you need to do next</a>
00:10:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h10m40s">a very unpleasant thing; but then</a>
00:10:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h10m43s">it might take you even years to fully manifest the learning that would be necessary in a situation like that</a>
00:10:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h10m50s">because there's so many things that you have to reconsider</a>
00:10:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h10m53s">first of all, the person might now appear to you as a threat, that's pretty immediate</a>
00:10:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h10m57s">so there's a biological, physiological response first, your body reacts first</a>
00:10:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h11m02s">then you respond emotionally, that's gonna take a while, and you know, the emotional response might extend over days, or weeks, or months, or even years</a>
00:11:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h11m11s">and then, as you're doing that as well, you're going to try to start to re-sort out your interpretive schema</a>
00:11:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h11m17s">so that it can adjust to the transformation that this...</a>
00:11:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h11m22s">this error on your part, say, or this catastrophe, or this betrayal</a>
00:11:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h11m26s">it has to adjust to whatever information that event contains</a>
00:11:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h11m31s">and so the orienting reflex can manifest itself over an extraordinarily long period of time</a>
00:11:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h11m36s">it's best to think about it as the initial part of what can be a very complex learning process</a>
00:11:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h11m43s">now, that was a standard idea in psychology for the longest period of time</a>
00:11:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h11m50s">that we created a detailed internal model of the world</a>
00:11:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h11m54s">and we watched how the world was unfolding, we compared the two</a>
00:11:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h11m58s">and the physiology, the neurophysiology of this was even understood to some degree, even by the Russians</a>
00:11:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h12m04s">in the early 1960s, because they basially localized...</a>
00:12:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h12m07s">you could use complex EEG, electroencephalogram technology</a>
00:12:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h12m12s">to localize where the orienting reflex was occurring in the brain, and basically it appeared to occur, roughly speaking, in the hippocampus</a>
00:12:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h12m19s">and the theory arose that your brain, your cortex, let's say, produced a very complex model of the world</a>
00:12:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h12m25s">an internal model; and your sense were producing a model of the external world</a>
00:12:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h12m30s">and the hippocampus was watching those things to see if they matched</a>
00:12:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h12m34s">and if they didn't match, there was a mismatch signal, and that would be the orienting reflex</a>
00:12:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h12m38s">and then your body would start to prepare itself for whatever that mismatch meant</a>
00:12:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h12m44s">and then you would engage in exploratory behavior to try to update your model</a>
00:12:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h12m49s">that was the standard theory, it was a very well accepted theory</a>
00:12:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h12m53s">it has elements of cybernetic theory in it</a>
00:12:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h12m56s">but it was accepted enough so that when people first started to experiment with artificial intelligence</a>
00:12:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h13m03s">that's how they tried to make artificially intelligent systems</a>
00:13:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h13m05s">they tried to make ones that would model the world, and then act, and then compare the changes in the world to that model</a>
00:13:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h13m12s">but that didn't go anywhere, it turned out, because it turned out that</a>
00:13:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h13m15s">it's so difficult to see and model the world that people had no idea how complex that was</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h13m22s">it was impossibly complex, as it turned out, and so that's part of the reason</a>
00:13:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h13m26s">we don't have robots wandering around, doing apparently simple things like walking</a>

00:13:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h13m33s">now, when we look at the environment, we think: well, it's not that hard to look at, it's full of objects</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h13m39s">they're just self-evident, there they are, and we can just wander through it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h13m43s">you know, and we don't even do that consciously to any great degree</a>
00:13:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h13m47s">because so much of that perception is presented to our consciousness without effort</a>
00:13:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h13m52s">in some sense; but the AI guys learned pretty quick that perceiving the world was waaay more difficult than anybody had guessed</a>
00:13:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h13m59s">and then this experiment really in some sense put a phenomenological punch behind that observation</a>
00:13:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h14m08s">because one of the presuppositions of the orienting reflex theory that I just laid out was that:</a>
00:14:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h14m15s">you were very good at detecting changes</a>
00:14:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h14m18s">that your nervous system would automatically detect change, anomaly</a>
00:14:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h14m21s">right, any mismatch between your model and what you expected, and then</a>
00:14:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h14m26s">well, the AI guys, I think, figured out first of all that was a big problem</a>
00:14:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h14m30s">that the problem of perception was much more complicated than that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h14m42s">in literary criticism, because, well</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h14m45s">it turns out to be hard enough to see a normal object, like a chair</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h15m07s">if you were actually painting it, you'd find out that the colors of the chair when it's in that location</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h15m13s">and the colors in the chair when it's in that location, just because of the difference in lighting</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h15m17s">are substantially different</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h15m29s">just because he was exploring how radically different the same object could be as it moved through contexts</a>
00:15:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h15m35s">so it isn't even obvious why we think this is the same object when you move it</a>
00:15:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h15m40s">and the answer is something like: well, you can sit on it in both positions</a>
00:15:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h15m44s">which is not a description of an object, by the way</a>
00:15:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h15m47s">right? that's a description of something that's useful, something that's a tool, something that exists in relationship to your body</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h15m54s">it's not an object; and so...</a>
00:15:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h15m57s">if you think that just looking at something like a chair is almost impossibly difficult</a>

00:16:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h16m04s">then imagine how difficult it is to perceive something like a text, you know, like a novel</a>
00:16:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h16m09s">because a novel obviously is subject to multiple interpretations</a>
00:16:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h16m14s">and the interpretations are gonna depend on, well, at least in principle</a>
00:16:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h16m18s">on the intent, conscious and unconscious, of the author</a>
00:16:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h16m22s">of the time, of the place, of the culture, of the language</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h16m26s">then that's just on the side of the production itself, but then there's the reader</a>
00:16:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h16m31s">it's like, I've read books when I was sixteen, and then reread them, say, when I was forty</a>
00:16:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h16m36s">and the book was almost completely different, as far as I was concerned</a>
00:16:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h16m39s">partly 'cause I knew what was in it the second time, and I didn't know what was in it the first time</a>
00:16:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h16m44s">and so, the meaning that manifests itself out of a book</a>
00:16:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h16m50s">is a consequence of all the complexity of the book plus all the complexity of the reader, and so</a>
00:16:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h16m56s">you know, if you're reading Russian literature, for example, and you've already read fifty Russian novels</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h17m02s">you're going to be in a much more different interpretive space</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h17m08s">than you are if, say, the Russian novel is the first novel you've ever read</a>
00:17:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h17m13s">and the Postmodernists were grappling with this</a>
00:17:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h17m17s">as well as with many other ideas that I think contaminated their thinking</a>
00:17:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h17m23s">and their conclusion was: well, you can't extract out a canonical meaning from a text</a>
00:17:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h17m28s">it's so dependent on the situation that to say the text has an interpretable meaning is actually an error, now</a>
00:17:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h17m36s">just because it's difficult to do something doesn't mean it's impossible</a>
00:17:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h17m40s">and there's massive holes in the postmodernist view</a>
00:17:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h17m44s">I think it's an unbelievably pathological view, personally</a>
00:17:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h17m47s">but the thing is is that there are reasons why it emerged</a>
00:17:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h17m52s">and the reasons were analogous to the reasons that the AI project initially failed</a>
00:17:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h17m57s">and analogous to the reasons that this experiment turned out the way it did</a>
00:17:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h18m01s">so I'm gonna show you this, many of you have seen this already, but as I said, it doesn't matter</a>
00:18:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h18m06s">your job here is to count the times... there's a team of three people here, dressed in white</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h18m16s">and your job is to count the number of times the white team throws the baskeball back and forth to the white team members</a>
00:18:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h18m22s">ok, we'll just run that</a>
00:18:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h18m56s">okay, well, so, obviously</a>
00:18:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h18m58s">or perhaps not so obviously, the</a>
00:18:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h19m03s">the number of times I believe that they threw it back and forth was sixteen, if I remember this correctly</a>
00:19:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h19m09s">but of course that's not really the issue, because what happens in the middle of the scene is that</a>
00:19:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h19m14s">a guy wearing a gorilla suit comes out into the middle of the screen, and pounds his chest three or four times</a>
00:19:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h19m20s">he comes out quite slowly, as you saw; is there anybody in here who didn't see the gorilla?</a>
00:19:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h19m26s">no, well, I presume all of you knew about this video anyways</a>
00:19:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h19m30s">so, Dan Simon, who produced this video has got a couple of other ones</a>
00:19:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h19m34s">where he shows that, you know, even if you're smart enough to see the gorilla, 'cause you've seen the video before you've heard about it</a>
00:19:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h19m40s">if you make other changes in the background, you'll count properly and you'll catch the gorilla, but you'll miss the other changes in the background</a>
00:19:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h19m47s">and they're not trivial either, it's really quite remarkable</a>
00:19:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h19m49s">he's produced other short videos, for example, where you'll be looking at a... like a field</a>
00:19:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h19m56s">and a road will grow in it, occupying about a third of the photograph's space</a>
00:19:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h20m02s">and you'd think well, yeah, you're gonna see that, it's like: you don't, you don't</a>
00:20:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h20m05s">so, okay, so this threw a big spanner into the works</a>
00:20:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h20m10s">this sort of experiment, along with the AI failures, and we could even say, the postmodern dilemma</a>
00:20:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h20m15s">it's like, well, hmm, everyone, virtually...</a>
00:20:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h20m19s">every psychologist would've predicted before this series of experiments that there's no damn way you'd miss that gorilla</a>
00:20:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h20m25s">because your nervous system was actually attuned to change in the environment</a>
00:20:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h20m29s">and that's a big change, and it's also a gorilla</a>
00:20:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h20m32s">it's something you would really think that you couldn't miss, you couldn't possibly miss</a>
00:20:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h20m37s">especially when it's occupying the center of the visual field</a>
00:20:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h20m41s">and so, well, this is part of a phenomena called change blindness</a>
00:20:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h20m45s">and it helped psychologists who had been studying the visual system for a very long time</a>
00:20:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h20m50s">to figure out, well mostly figure out exactly how blind human beings are</a>
00:20:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h20m56s">because we're way blinder than we think, and</a>
00:20:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h20m59s">and so we actually focus on much less of the world than we think, and</a>
00:20:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h21m03s">we do that partly... it's not exactly obvious how we do it</a>
00:21:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h21m08s">it's kinda like we hold a still picture in our imagination</a>
00:21:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h21m12s">and then fill in the details by using our central foveal vision</a>
00:21:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h21m15s">which is always dancing around like a pinpoint or a laser beam, moving back and forth</a>
00:21:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h21m20s">and we're assembling those little snapshots from the fovea into a relatively coherent picture</a>
00:21:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h21m27s">maybe what happens is that I look at you, and then I look at you [points to a different student]</a>
00:21:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h21m32s">and I've still got the information from looking at you, so my brain can sort of infer that that's remained stable</a>
00:21:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h21m38s">but like if I look at you, and I...</a>
00:21:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h21m40s">I tried to learn how to do this, 'cause you can look at something, and then pay attention to the periphery, it's annoying</a>
00:21:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h21m47s">but, so if I'm looking at you, I really can't make out your eyes [points to a different student]</a>
00:21:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h21m52s">I can more or less make out the fact that you have a head</a>
00:21:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h21m55s">especially if you move it, so your periphery is sory of like frog vision or dinosaur vision</a>
00:21:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h22m02s">it's much better at picking up movement than it is at picking up something that's staying still</a>
00:22:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h22m06s">and that makes sense, because, well, if it's staying still, and it hasn't already hurt you, then</a>
00:22:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h22m13s">it's probably not going to hurt you; but if it's moving, then, you know, that's a good thing that you might pay attention to</a>
00:22:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h22m18s">and so, if your periphery catches movement, then you'll focus your fovea on it</a>
00:22:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h22m22s">it's like you go from really low resolution to really high resolution</a>
00:22:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h22m26s">so the center of your vision is incredibly high resolution</a>
00:22:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h22m30s">but then it fades into low resolution as you move towards the periphery, until it's out here</a>
00:22:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h22m34s">which would be about 170 degrees</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h22m58s">your vision is a very, very strange thing, and it's focusing on something very specific</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h23m16s">that turns out to be an insanely complicated problem</a>
00:23:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h23m21s">John Vervaeke talks about that all the time as the problem of relevance</a>
00:23:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h23m25s">and the issue is: well, there's many, many things in the world, there's an infinite number of things, let's say</a>
00:23:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h23m31s">and you're not gonna be able to see them, that's for sure, even if they happen to be changing, as it turns out</a>
00:23:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h23m37s">and so, out of this mess, first of all, how do you pick what to look at?</a>
00:23:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h23m41s">and second, even if you do pick it, how do you see it? 'cause it's so crazily complicated</a>
00:23:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h23m46s">so that's the problem that we're going to try to unpack</a>
00:23:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h23m49s">now, roughly speaking, what seems to have happened with the gorilla video is</a>
00:23:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h23m54s">you have to take that first theory, that you make a complete model of the world</a>
00:23:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h24m00s">which is the objects in the world, and how they're interacting</a>
00:24:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h24m04s">and you compare that to the objects in the actual world and how they're interacting</a>
00:24:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h24m08s">you have to modify that model, you say: well, no, you're certainly not making a complete model</a>
00:24:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h24m13s">and people should have known better anyways; even subjects to the limits of your perception, because</a>
00:24:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h24m18s">there's all sorts of things in the world that you can't directly perceive, but</a>
00:24:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h24m22s">what you're doing instead is something like: you're making a partial model of the world</a>
00:24:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h24m28s">but you're only making a partial model of the world that you're currently operating on</a>
00:24:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h24m33s">with some goal in mind</a>
00:24:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h24m35s">and you're also comparing that to a model of the world as it's currently unfolding</a>
00:24:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h24m39s">'cause the other thing that was implicit... this is really tricky, this is where you have to watch your implicit assumptions</a>
00:24:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h24m45s">the other thing that was implicit in the original cybernetic theory was that</a>
00:24:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h24m50s">you have a model of the world that's complete</a>
00:24:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h24m54s">and then what you're watching is the actual world as it unfolds</a>
00:24:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h24m58s">and that's not a model, that's just your perception of the object; but that also turns out to be wrong, because</a>
00:24:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h25m04s">your perception of the world as it unfolds is also a model, and so</a>
00:25:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h25m08s">what's happening is: you look at the world</a>
00:25:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h25m11s">the world you see is a model, and a very partial model at that</a>
00:25:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h25m15s">and then you compare it to the model that you expect or desire, more accurately, desire</a>
00:25:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h25m20s">although the initial models were expectation</a>
00:25:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h25m23s">because if you're in the lab, listening to tones it's not like you desire anything</a>
00:25:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h25m27s">but mostly when you're acting in the world, you have desires</a>
00:25:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h25m31s">so the experimental constraints skewed the data in some sense by making people assume that</a>
00:25:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h25m38s">what people were doing when they walked through the world was expecting instead of desiring</a>
00:25:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h25m42s">anyways, you have a model of the world that's generated as you look at it</a>
00:25:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h25m46s">you have another model of the world that's something like the world that you desire</a>
00:25:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h25m49s">then you compare both of them, and they can mismatch, and they can mismatch in a way that upsets your current pursuit</a>
00:25:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h25m56s">that's the critical issue</a>
00:25:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h25m58s">you don't see the anomaly unless it upsets your current pursuit</a>
00:25:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h26m02s">and you kinda know that too, because when you're...</a>
00:26:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h26m04s">like, while I'm lecturing to you guys</a>
00:26:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h26m07s">you know, mostly you're sitting still, but people are moving their arms, and they're moving their glasses, and they're shifting their feet, and</a>
00:26:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h26m14s">generally I don't see any of that, because what difference does it make?</a>
00:26:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h26m19s">you know, it's not relevant to the ongoing... to the ongoing what?</a>
00:26:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h26m25s">ongoing contract? the ongoig series of interactions? it's something like that</a>
00:26:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h26m30s">so as long as you keep your movements bounded</a>
00:26:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h26m33s">within a range that doesn't interfere with whatever it is we're doing</a>
00:26:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h26m38s">then it's going to be as invisible to me as the gorilla was when you were counting the balls</a>
00:26:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h26m43s">and the cool thing is about the gorilla experiment, or one of them, is that</a>
00:26:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h26m46s">the reason you were blind to the gorilla was because you were counting the balls</a>
00:26:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h26m51s">and so, that's so fascinating , because what it shows to a huge degree, to an unfathomable degree</a>
00:26:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h26m58s">to an unfathomable degree is that</a>
00:26:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h27m03s">the value structure that you inhabit determines what you perceive</a>
00:27:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h27m07s">it doesn't just determine what you expect or want, it bloody well determines what you see</a>
00:27:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h27m12s">and that makes the world a completely different place, no one really expected that</a>
00:27:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h27m17s">and so, if you watch the basketball, you see the basketball</a>
00:27:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h27m22s">if you stop watching the basketball, well then you see the gorilla, and so</a>
00:27:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h27m26s">the first question that arises from an experiment like that is:</a>
00:27:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h27m30s">just exactly what is it that you don't see in the world? and the answer is: all of it</a>
00:27:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h27m36s">you see so little it's unbelievable; you see that tiny amount that's necessary</a>
00:27:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h27m41s">for you to undertake the next sequence in your plotted movements...?</a>
00:27:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h27m46s">it's something like that; but then that becomes very complicated, too, because</a>
00:27:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h27m50s">it isn't obvious how you can conceptualize or how you can determine what your next movement is</a>
00:27:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h27m57s">because it's not like you just add up movements and make up your life</a>
00:27:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h28m02s">it's not that simple, and it's related to the novel problem, the problem of meaning in a literary work</a>
00:28:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h28m09s">so imagine: you're trying to specify the meaning of a literary work, well</a>
00:28:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h28m15s">there's meaning in the word, but the meaning of the word is dependent on the phrase within which it's embedded</a>
00:28:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h28m22s">and then the meaning of the phrase is dependent on the sentence that it's embedded in</a>
00:28:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h28m26s">and the sentence in the paragraph, and the paragraph in the chapter, and the chapter in the book</a>
00:28:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h28m31s">and the book in the corpus of books of that sort</a>
00:28:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h28m34s">and then within the culture, and then within whatever your peculiar personal experience is</a>
00:28:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h28m40s">all of those things, nested, are operative to some degree when you're extracting out the meaning at any level of analysis</a>
00:28:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h28m47s">they're all operating simultaneously, so you might say, well</a>
00:28:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h28m49s">what are you doing in this classroom?</a>
00:28:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h28m52s">well, the answer is: sitting in a chair</a>
00:28:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h28m56s">but that's... obviously that's a very short-term and context-independent answer</a>
00:28:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h29m03s">but you're also attending to what I'm saying, hypothetically</a>
00:29:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h29m07s">and you're attending to some of it, and not to other parts, you're thinking about some parts and not other parts</a>
00:29:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h29m13s">and you're also attending a class, and a class is a sequence of lectures</a>
00:29:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h29m18s">and that's embedded within your desire to finish up the semester</a>
00:29:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h29m22s">and then to finish up the year, and then to get your degree</a>
00:29:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h29m25s">and then you nest that inside whatever it is, whatever the reason it is that you're getting your degree</a>
00:29:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h29m30s">and then maybe that's nested inside your career goals, and that's nested inside your life goals</a>
00:29:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h29m35s">and that's nested inside your ultimate values, which you may or may not even be aware of</a>
00:29:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h29m40s">and so, I could say, well, you're sitting here because it serves your ultimate values</a>
00:29:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h29m46s">well, that's true</a>
00:29:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h29m49s">it seems a bit abstract to be useful, right, it's so vague out at the outermost levels, that</a>
00:29:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h29m56s">it doesn't really have much specificity, right, so it seems to lack information, but</a>
00:29:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h30m00s">by the same token if I said what you're doing is sitting there</a>
00:30:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h30m03s">it has the same problem of too restricted meaning, because of overspecificity</a>
00:30:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h30m08s">and so, there's some level in there that you would interpret as meaningful, God only knows why</a>
00:30:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h30m15s">and that's the level... there's a natural level of perception for that sort of thing</a>
00:30:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h30m20s">so for example, when children learn to name an animal, for example, they'll name "cat"</a>
00:30:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h30m27s">they don't name the species of cat, or the subspecies of cat</a>
00:30:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h30m31s">and they don't confuse cats with dogs, even though they're both in the category of "four-legged furry mammal"</a>
00:30:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h30m38s">so, why not call the cat and the dog "furry mammals"?</a>
00:30:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h30m43s">well, children don't do that, they go to "cat" and "dog"</a>
00:30:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h30m46s">and people who've studied the acquisition of language have found that there are basic-level categories that children pick up first</a>
00:30:46</p>

00:30:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h31m00s">because they seem to reflect the natural level at which people perceive the world</a>
00:31:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h31m04s">but none of that's obvious, you know</a>
00:31:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h31m08s">I mean you could just lump all animals together, for that matter, and just call them "animals", which we do sometimes</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h31m16s">anyways, so it's very difficult to specify the meaning level, and it's not very easy at all to figure out how we do it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h31m21s">and so that's partly what I'm trying to unpack, so...</a>
00:31:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h31m26s">here's part of the issue, so let's say that you're... you have a computer</a>
00:31:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h31m32s">yeah, I have a story for this, so</a>
00:31:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h31m36s">one time, when I was in Montreal, I was using my computer</a>
00:31:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h31m42s">I was in my apartment</a>
00:31:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h31m44s">and I was typing out an essay, and it crashed, and so</a>
00:31:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h31m49s">what happens when your computer crashes? well, you know, usually you utter some sort of curse</a>
00:31:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h31m54s">and it's interesting that you do that, because the circuit that you use to curse with</a>
00:31:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h32m00s">is the same circuit that monkeys use to detect eagles, or leopards, or snakes</a>
00:32:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h32m06s">and so, when there's a bunch of monkeys together</a>
00:32:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h32m09s">you know, they're not all preyed on by eagles and leopards and snakes, but</a>
00:32:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h32m12s">you know, there's usually a predator in that category for every single monkey population</a>
00:32:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h32m16s">and so, when the monkeys are watching, they have an emotional utterance that the most nervous monkey might utter first</a>
00:32:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h32m23s">that basically says, you know, hide from the eagle; get out on the thin branch, so the cougar can't eat you; and look the hell out for the snake</a>
00:32:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h32m31s">but there's a circuit that's linked to emotions that produces that instinctive utterance that represents that category</a>
00:32:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h32m38s">and that's the same circuit that you use when you curse</a>
00:32:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h32m42s">and it's not the same circuit that you use for normal language</a>
00:32:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h32m45s">we know that, because that circuit is activated in people who have Tourette's syndrome</a>
00:32:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h32m50s">because they preferentially swear</a>
00:32:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h32m52s">you think, well, why in the world would you have a neurological condition that makes you preferentially curse?</a>
00:32:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h32m57s">well, that's the reason: you don't just have one linguistic circuit</a>
00:32:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h33m00s">you have one for: "oh my God, there's a predator!"</a>
00:33:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h33m05s">and that's the one that will get activated when something happens like your computer crashing</a>
00:33:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h33m10s">because, you know, you're an evolved creature, and so those old circuits that were there, say, 30 million years ago</a>
00:33:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h33m16s">to deal with exceptions</a>
00:33:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h33m19s">are the same circuits you're using now to deal with your computer; why else would you wanna hit it?</a>
00:33:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h33m23s">right? 'cause that's what you want - give it a whack! it's like: it doesn't behave - whack!</a>
00:33:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h33m28s">aggression right away, well, that's some clue as to the category system that you're automatically using</a>
00:33:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h33m36s">to encapsulate the event</a>
00:33:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h33m39s">ok, so fine, what do you do when your computer crashes?</a>
00:33:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h33m41s">well, first you curse, and then you do the stupid things that idiot primates do when they're trying to deal with something that's way too complex</a>
00:33:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h33m47s">maybe you turn it on and off, right? and that doesn't work</a>
00:33:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h33m51s">it didn't work, and so then I thought, well, maybe the power bar went, so I checked the power bar</a>
00:33:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h33m56s">and I turned it on and off, and nothing happened</a>
00:33:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h33m58s">so I brought a light behind the computer, and the light wouldn't go on, so I thought, aha!</a>
00:33:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h34m03s">I must have blown a fuse! so I went to the fuse box and took a look, but the fuses were fine</a>
00:34:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h34m08s">and so I thought, well, the power's gone out, so then I went outside, and the power was out</a>
00:34:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h34m14s">none of the street light were working, the power was out everywhere</a>
00:34:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h34m17s">and it was seriously out, because this was the time that almost the entire northeast power grid in Quebec collapsed</a>
00:34:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h34m25s">and the reason it collapsed was because there was a solar flare</a>
00:34:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h34m28s">that happens reasonably often, a solar flare produced a huge electromagnetic pulse</a>
00:34:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h34m33s">because it's basically, you know, like a million hydrogen bombs going off at the same time</a>
00:34:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h34m39s">93 million miles away</a>
00:34:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h34m41s">produces this tremendous electromagnetic pulse</a>
00:34:41</p>

00:34:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h34m47s">produces a spike in current in the main power lines, and blows the whole system</a>
00:34:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h34m52s">and so, just so you know, an event like that happens about every 150 years</a>
00:34:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h35m00s">and if we had one now, it would take out all of our electronics</a>
00:35:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h35m03s">like one of the big ones, there was a big one in the late 1800's</a>
00:35:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h35m05s">everything, satellites, computers, cars, everything - gone</a>
00:35:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h35m10s">and so that's a big problem, and no one knows what to do about it</a>
00:35:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h35m13s">one missed us by about nine minutes, I think two years ago</a>
00:35:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h35m16s">so that's something else to worry about, if you're inclined to worry about those sorts of things</a>
00:35:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h35m21s">um, ok, so what did I conclude from that? well, the...</a>
00:35:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h35m28s">the function of my computer was dependent on the stability of the sun</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h35m32s">it's not the first thing you check out when your computer crashes, right?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h35m39s">no problem, I can cross that off the list</a>
00:35:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h35m42s">but to me it's an extraordinarily interesting example of the invisible interdependence of things</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h35m58s">so, for example, when you're interacting with your computer, you're not interacting with your computer at all, really</a>
00:35:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h36m04s">you're interacting with the keyboard, sort of one key at a time</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h36m11s">but as long as the computer is working, you don't care about it at all, you don't give it a second thought</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h44m13s">so, the thing in itself, that's an old philosophical concept and I think it came from Kant</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h44m19s">But I'm not sure about that. That might be older than that</a>

00:44:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h44m34s">maybe I could see every level of your being, from the sub-atomic level, up to this level of perception then beyond</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h45m50s">because you know if you're like a Freudian, you think</a>
00:45:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h45m54s">well, as long as your ego is well constituted, you can keep your emotions under control</a>
00:45:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h45m59s">it's like, yes and no, mostly no</a>
00:45:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h46m03s">I like the Piaget an idea better, which is</a>
00:46:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h46m06s">if you're well socialized, you're awake enough to identify the game that's going on wherever you go</a>
00:46:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h46m12s">and then you play that game immediately and so do all the other socialized primates</a>
00:46:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h46m16s">and so then you can just understand the game you don't have to understand them, thank God</a>
00:46:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h46m22s">you could just understand the game</a>
00:46:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h46m23s">and as long as the game continues you don't have to be nervous, because you know</a>
00:46:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h46m27s">you at least know what's going to happen and maybe you even know how to get what you want in that game</a>
00:46:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h46m33s">and so… so that again that's really worth thinking about, because</a>
00:46:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h46m38s">we talked about this before about why people want to maintain their culture</a>
00:46:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h46m42s">it isn't just because their culture is a belief system that helps them orient themselves in the world</a>
00:46:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h46m48s">it's because I believe system is a game that everyone who shares that belief system is playing</a>
00:46:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h46m54s">and the fact that everybody's playing means nobody needs to get upset</a>
00:46:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h46m58s">So it isn't like the belief system is directly inhibiting the emotions. That isn't how it works</a>
00:46:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h47m04s">so… and it's not like the culture is just a belief system</a>
00:47:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h47m08s">it's only secondarily a belief system, man</a>
00:47:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h47m10s">mostly it's a game that people are actively engaging in</a>
00:47:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h47m14s">that's way more important than the beliefs that go along with it</a>
00:47:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h47m18s">you even need the damn beliefs you know that's why wolves can live with each other</a>
00:47:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h47m23s">I don't know what the they'll have a belief system exactly</a>
00:47:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h47m27s">mostly they have a set of</a>
00:47:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h47m31s">they have a game, that is the wolf game, roughly speaking</a>
00:47:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h47m34s">and all the wolves know how to play it, and, so, that's that</a>
00:47:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h47m37s">that's how they keep themselves organized in their packs</a>
00:47:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h47m40s">a lot of its externalized</a>
00:47:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h47m42s">and so</a>
00:47:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h47m44s">okay, so, anyway, so,</a>
00:47:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h47m46s">the thing in itself, that's a very complicated thing. It got multiple dimensions, multiple levels</a>
00:47:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h47m54s">and then it's worse than that because it doesn't only have multiple levels, but all those levels move across time</a>
00:47:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h48m01s">and every one of those level shifts as it moves across time</a>
00:48:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h48m04s">and so I like to think of the thing in itself like a symphony</a>
00:48:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h48m09s">I think that's a good model. I think that's why we like music, in fact</a>
00:48:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h48m12s">because music shows you a multi-level reality that unfolds and shifts across time, within some parameters, right? because</a>
00:48:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h48m19s">it is not just chaos</a>
00:48:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h48m22s">the music has an element of predictability and an element of unpredictability and it has these multiple levels</a>
00:48:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h48m27s">and that's sort of what everything in the world is like. It's what the world is like</a>
00:48:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h48m33s">so this is… a even that is just a conceptual model of the thing in itself first of all that's only got 2 dimensions instead of 3</a>
00:48:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h48m40s">cuz it could be a cube</a>
00:48:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h48m42s">and then it has… even a cube has 3 dimensions instead of 4, because</a>
00:48:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h48m46s">if that was a cube, adding the third dimension</a>
00:48:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h48m50s">then it would also be a cube that would transform and shift as it moved across time</a>
00:48:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h48m55s">and that's what the thing in itself is but that's too damn complicated</a>
00:48:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h48m58s">so then the question is when you look at it, what you see?</a>
00:48:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h49m01s">and the answer is</a>
00:49:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h49m03s">to some degree, it depends on what you want to use it for</a>
00:49:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h49m06s">and so I would say will hear look at the different ways you can look at this</a>
00:49:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h49m09s">might say what is this</a>
00:49:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h49m11s">somebody could say well it's a rectangle</a>
00:49:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h49m14s">and would you say that's correct</a>
00:49:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h49m15s">it's like, well</a>
00:49:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h49m20s">it's not correct because there's not a one-to-one correspondence, but</a>
00:49:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h49m24s">it might be a useful conceptualization if you think about that as a box</a>
00:49:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h49m29s">it could contain that</a>
00:49:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h49m30s">and if you are carrying the box to only have to be concerned about the box and so that would be fine</a>
00:49:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h49m35s">it's a good functional simplification</a>
00:49:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h49m37s">that one's a little higher resolution because it says well yeah it's actually four rectangles</a>
00:49:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h49m42s">and that one says, well, wait, think about that is an orchard that someone's looking at from the top</a>
00:49:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h49m48s">you want to figure out how to walk from South to North</a>
00:49:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h49m50s">well, you got a little map there</a>
00:49:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h49m53s">cuz you can think of those as bars instead of collections of dots</a>
00:49:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h49m58s">Piaget showed the children will automatically do this. So for example if you take six dots and put them in a row</a>
00:49:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h50m05s">and you take the same six dots and you stretch them out so the rows this much longer</a>
00:50:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h50m10s">and then you asked the child where there are more dots, the child will say that there are more dots where it's longer</a>
00:50:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h50m15s">because they're flipping in some sense between the perception of the individual dot, and the perception of the shape that the array of dots makes</a>
00:50:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h50m25s">and so, the shape is longer, 'cause you could see it as a rectangle</a>
00:50:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h50m27s">so they think, well, longer is bigger, bigger is more, there's gotta be more dots</a>
00:50:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h50m36s">and then there's this one, which is sort of an amalgam of this one and this one, and then that one</a>
00:50:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h50m40s">and that's the highest resolution model of that that's still a simplification</a>
00:50:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h50m47s">and you know, what I like about this diagram is that, you know, people say, well...</a>
00:50:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h50m53s">the facts are the facts, and what we're disagreeing about is our opinion about the facts</a>
00:50:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h50m57s">it's like, no... yes...</a>
00:50:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h50m59s">you have an opinion about the facts, but the world is so horribly complex that you can actually disagree about the facts themselves</a>
00:50:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h51m06s">and I think and ideology does that to people very commonly</a>
00:51:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h51m10s">so I saw this movie once that Naomi Klein made</a>
00:51:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h51m13s">if I tell you the same story, tell me, 'cause I don't wanna tell you the same story, but I might</a>
00:51:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h51m18s">so she went down to Argentina after a bunch of money had got out of Argentina beause of a financial collapse</a>
00:51:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h51m25s">and she went to a factory that had been padlocked, and it was a heavy machinery factory</a>
00:51:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h51m30s">and the workers had decided they were gonna undo the padlocks and go build machines, you know</a>
00:51:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h51m37s">to hell with the owner who shut it down!</a>
00:51:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h51m40s">and so, she went down and made this movie, and followed these workers around</a>
00:51:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h51m44s">and showed how catastrophic their lives have been because they'd lost their livelihood in this big financial crash</a>
00:51:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h51m49s">and so that was really interesting; but then she went and interviewed the guy who owned the factory, and</a>
00:51:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h51m53s">she treated him like he was... like a cipher in some sense</a>
00:51:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h51m57s">instead of asking him: how he got the factory? what he wanted to do with it? how it fit in with his life plans?</a>
00:51:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h52m03s">why he shut it down instead of continuing it?</a>
00:52:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h52m07s">she didn't get the back story on him, she just left him in the "evil capitalist" box and went on with the film</a>
00:52:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h52m14s">and it was... it wasn't like what she did wasn't true</a>
00:52:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h52m19s">but it was only half true, and it was half true because she could perceive the complexity of the workers, having sympathy for them</a>
00:52:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h52m26s">but as far as she was concerned, the enemy, the owner had no complexity</a>
00:52:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h52m31s">he was just "bad capitalist", and that how it was left in the movie</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h52m34s">I found it profoundly unsatisfying, because I wanted to know, okay, it's like</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h54m29s">so we're blurring across them, so we have a much less high-resolution image here</a>
00:54:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h54m36s">so you take the thing in itself, you perceive it as a low-resolution representation</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h54m46s">and so the word is a twofold compression</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h54m50s">and then when someone tosses you the word, you unpack it into a low-resolution perception</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h54m56s">and then maybe into the world itself, if you can do that, but probably not</a>
00:54:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h55m00s">so that's what we're doing, we're taking the complex world, we fold it into a simple perception</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h55m04s">we fold that into a word, we throw the word to someone else, and they unpack it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h55m08s">and the only way you can unpack it, of course, is if you'd had enough similar experience so that you have the reference for the word already in your experience</a>
00:55:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h55m16s">which is why you have to use simplified language with children, right, because</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h56m20s">but what they mean by "literal", or what they attempt to make "literal" mean, is that they're in the same category, as scientific facts</a>
00:56:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h56m27s">because they don't have the idea that there are different ways of approaching truth</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h56m44s">and so the  fundamentalists basically make the proposition that</a>
00:56:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h56m49s">the idea that God created the world in six days, five thousand years ago is literally true</a>

00:57:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h57m39s">for a bunch of reasons, one is that</a>
00:57:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h57m42s">the people who wrote the ancient stories that we have access to were - in no way, shape or form - scientists</a>
00:57:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h57m50s">you know, modern people tend to think that you think like a scientist, and people have always thought that way</a>
00:57:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h57m55s">first of all, you do not think like a scientist</a>
00:57:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h57m58s">even scientists hardly even think like scientists</a>
00:57:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h58m00s">but if you're not scientifically trained, you don't think like a scientist at all</a>
00:58:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h58m04s">so one of the things, for example, that characterizes your thinking is confirmation bias</a>
00:58:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h58m09s">so if you have a theory, what you do is wander around in the world, looking for reasons why it's true</a>
00:58:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h58m14s">and a scientist does exactly the opposite of that</a>
00:58:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h58m17s">in the little tiny, narrow domain where he or she is actually capable of being a scientist</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h58m22s">and what they have is a theory, and look for a way to prove it wrong</a>
00:58:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h58m26s">but, believe me, you don't run around doing that</a>
00:58:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h58m28s">you can train yourself so now and then you can do that</a>
00:58:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h58m31s">you can learn to listen to people, for example, on the off chance that you might be wrong</a>
00:58:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h58m36s">but that is by no means a natural way of thinking</a>

00:58:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h58m57s">you can argue when science emerged, but it's certainly emerged in its articulated form in the last thousand years</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h59m06s">I think you could say even more specifically that it emerged in the last five hudred years</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h59m11s">now, you might argue with that, and say: what about the Greeks and other people who were fairly technologically sophisticated?</a>
00:59:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h59m17s">or who invented geometry or that kind of thing</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=00h59m28s">it never occurred to him to actually go out in the world and look at it to see if what he assumed about it was true</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h00m21s">part of the reason is, though, that everyone, fundamentalists included, really believe in scientific facts</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h01m09s">it's really problematic for people</a>
01:01:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h01m12s">it's problematic in a real way, I think, because</a>
01:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h01m15s">one of the problems with the scientific viewpoint is it doesn't tell you anything about what you should do with your life</a>
01:01:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h01m20s">it doesn't solve the problem of value at all</a>
01:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h01m24s">in fact, it might make it more difficult, because</a>
01:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h01m27s">one of the fundamental scientific claims, roughly speaking, is that every fact is of equal utility</a>
01:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h01m33s">at least from a scientific perspective; there's no hierarchy of facts</a>
01:01:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h01m38s">that's not exactly true, because you can think of one theory as "more true" than another</a>
01:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h01m44s">but that boils down to saying that it's more useful than another</a>
01:01:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h01m48s">so I don't think that that's a really good exception</a>
01:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h01m50s">okay, so fine</a>
01:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h01m53s">you got the scientific atheists on one end and you got the religious fundamentalists on the other</a>
01:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h01m57s">and what they both agree on, whether they like it or not, is that</a>
01:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h02m01s">there's so much power in the scientific method that it's difficult to dispute the validity of scientific facts</a>
01:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h02m07s">and they seem to exist in contradiction to the older, archaic stories</a>
01:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h02m12s">if you also accept them as fact-based accounts</a>
01:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h02m17s">so what do we do about that? well, if you're on the scientific atheist end of things</a>
01:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h02m21s">you say: well, those old stories are just superstitious science</a>
01:02:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h02m25s">second-rate, barbaric, archaic forms of science; you just dispense with them, they're nothing but trouble</a>
01:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h02m30s">and if you're on the fundamentalist side, you say: well we'll try to shoehorn science into this framework</a>
01:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h02m36s">and really that doesn't work very well; it doesn't work very well with the claims of evolution, for example</a>
01:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h02m40s">in fact, it works very badly, and that's a problem, because evolutionary theory is like... it's a killer theory</a>
01:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h02m47s">it's really, really hard...</a>
01:02:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h02m51s">like it's not a complete theory, and there's lots of things we don't know about evolution, but... you know</a>
01:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h02m57s">trying to handwave that away, that's not gonna work without dispensing with most of biology</a>
01:02:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h03m05s">so that's a big problem; so here's another way of thinking about it</a>
01:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h03m11s">you don't just need one way of looking at the world</a>
01:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h03m15s">maybe you need two ways of looking at the world, and I'm not exactly sure how they should be related to one another</a>
01:03:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h03m21s">like which should take precedence under which circumstance</a>
01:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h03m25s">but one problem is: what's the world made of?</a>
01:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h03m29s">you know, what's the world, conceptualized as an objective place, made of</a>
01:03:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h03m34s">and the other is: how should you conduct yourself while you're alive?</a>
01:03:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h03m38s">and there's no reason to assume that those questions can be answered using the same approach</a>
01:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h03m46s">I mean, physics has its methods, chemistry has its methods, and biology has its methods</a>
01:03:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h03m53s">so a method for obtaining the truth can be bound to a domain</a>
01:03:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h03m59s">so why would we necessarily assume that you could use the same set of tools</a>
01:03:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h04m03s">to represent the world as a place of objects, and to represent as a place in which a biological creature would act?</a>
01:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h04m10s">I mean, anyways, I'm suggesting that we...</a>
01:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h04m15s">that we don't view it that way, that we have two different viewpoints</a>
01:04:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h04m20s">maybe they can be brought together, although it's not obvious how</a>
01:04:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h04m23s">but that it's not a tenable solution to get rid of one in favor of the other</a>
01:04:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h04m29s">and I think the reason for that is that...</a>
01:04:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h04m33s">you need to know how to conduct yourself in the world</a>
01:04:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h04m36s">you have to have a value system, you can't even look at the damn world with out a value system</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h04m41s">it's not possible; your emotional health is dependent on a value system, the way you interact with other people is dependent on a value system</a>
01:04:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h04m49s">there's no getting away from it</a>
01:04:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h04m51s">and you say, well, there's no justification for any value system from a scientific perspective</a>
01:04:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h04m56s">you're gonna draw that conclusion that no value system is valid, where the hell does that leave you?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h05m01s">there's no down, there's no up, there's no rationale for moving in any direction</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h05m07s">there's not even really any rationale for living</a>
01:05:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h05m09s">and so people say things like: well, why the hell should I care what happens, in a million years who's gonna know the difference?</a>
01:05:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h05m14s">it's like, yeah, yeah, true. stupid, but true</a>
01:05:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h05m19s">and the reason I think it's stupid is because it's just a game, you know</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h05m23s">I can take anything of any sort and find a context in which it's irrelevant</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h05m35s">well, what do you say to someone who says that? you say, well, seems like the wrong frame of reference, bucko</a>
01:05:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h05m41s">that's what it looks like to me; you know, 'cause at some point you question the damn frame of reference, not what you derive from it</a>
01:05:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h05m49s">and it certainly seems to me that situations like that don't allow you to use that kind of frame of reference, there's something inhumane about it</a>
01:05:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h05m57s">and that trumps the logic, or at least it should</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h06m01s">and if it doesn't, then all hell breaks loose, and that doesn't seem to be a good thing</a>
01:06:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h06m05s">okay, so I have this quote from Shakespeare here</a>
01:06:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h06m08s">he says: all the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players: they have their exits and their entrances; and one man in time plays many parts</a>
01:06:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h06m16s">well, it's the sort of thing that you'd expect a dramatist to pen, but that's how he looked at the world</a>
01:06:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h06m22s">and we still watch Shakespeare's plays some hundreds of years later because there seems to be something essential captured in them</a>
01:06:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h06m30s">something about how people do act, but more importantly, I think, how people should and shouldn't act</a>
01:06:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h06m35s">because what fun is it going to a play that doesn't outline how someone should and shouldn't act?</a>
01:06:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h06m42s">you want a good guy or a couple of them, maybe they can be complex interminglings of good and bad</a>
01:06:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h06m48s">you know, that makes it more sophisticated</a>
01:06:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h06m50s">and you want a bad guy or a bad... you always want to see that contract either within a character or between characters</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h06m59s">and it's because you want to know how to live properly, that's how to be a good person</a>
01:06:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h07m03s">and you wanna know how to live improperly, how to be a bad person, so you can watch out for people like that</a>
01:07:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h07m08s">or so you can figure out what that means for yourself; it's compelling</a>
01:07:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h07m14s">and that's another thing that's worth thinking about:</a>
01:07:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h07m19s">why is it compelling?</a>
01:07:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h07m22s">and it's compelling to everyone, and that's the thing that's so cool, is that there aren't that many phenomena that you can point to that are compelling to everyone</a>
01:07:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h07m29s">music is close, it's a very rare person who doesn't like at least some genre of music, no matter how narrow</a>
01:07:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h07m36s">but the other one is stories, you're hard pressed to find someone, especially if they're younger, who doesn't like stories</a>
01:07:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h07m43s">why? is it a waste of time? or is there something going on?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h07m48s">well...</a>
01:07:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h07m50s">i think it's not only not a waste of time, it's actually the most fundamentally important thing you can possibly do</a>
01:07:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h07m57s">because there's no difference between understanding stories and figuring out how to get along in the world</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h08m03s">so, and there's a tight relationship between the story that you inhabit, that structures your behavior</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h08m10s">and the games that Piaget talked about, that organize people's behavior,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h08m14s">to some degree the reason we can all sit in this room together like this</a>
01:08:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h08m20s">is because a huge chunk of the value system that guides our behavior is shared</a>
01:08:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h08m26s">so I'm lecturing and you're sitting in the classroom, and that distinguishes us to some degree</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h08m33s">but you know that that's partly merely a consequence of the difference in our age</a>

01:10:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h10m15s">okay, so let's go back to the complexity problem</a>
01:10:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h10m19s">you see, I actually think in some sense that's the fundamental problem</a>
01:10:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h10m25s">when you read about the terror management theorist types</a>
01:10:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h10m30s">they think that death is the fundamental problem</a>
01:10:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h10m33s">and that's a good argument, because it's definitely a fundamental problem, but I think it's a subset of the complexity problem</a>
01:10:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h10m40s">and the reason I think that is because sometimes people's lives become so complex that they'd rather be dead</a>
01:10:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h10m47s">and the reason they seek death through suicide is to make the complexity go away</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h11m23s">and you know, one of the interesting things about being a psychologist is that</a>
01:11:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h11m27s">what you learn if you're gonna be a psychologist is that people come to you with mental illnesses - and that's almost never true</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h11m34s">people come to you, because their lives are so damn complicated, they cannot stay on top of them</a>
01:11:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h11m38s">in any way that doesn't make it look like they're just gonna get more complicated</a>
01:11:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h11m43s">and so then that causes symptoms, you know it's like...</a>
01:11:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h11m46s">there's this old idea, a sort of a metaphor for genetic susceptibility</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h11m51s">take a balloon and blow it up until it's beyond its tolerance - it's going to blow out at the weakest point</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h11m56s">well that's sort of what a genetic susceptibility is</a>
01:11:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h11m58s">if I just keep adding complexity on top of you, at some point you'll blow out at your weakest point</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h12m03s">you know, maybe you'll get physiologically ill, maybe you'll start drinking</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h12m07s">maybe you'll develop an anxiety disorder, maybe you'll get OCD, maybe you'll get depressed</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h12m11s">whatever, they'll be something about you that's the weakest point</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h12m14s">and if I just push, that's where you'll blow out, so</a>
01:12:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h12m17s">that's a mental illness, but those things almost never just happen</a>
01:12:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h12m21s">sometimes, but not very often, usually people have just been hammered like two or three different ways</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h12m26s">and then they collapse in the direction of their biological weakness, and</a>
01:12:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h12m31s">then maybe you put them back together, but</a>
01:12:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h12m33s">it's almost always a complexity-related phenomenon rather than a mental illness-related phenomenon</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h12m38s">not always, but almost always</a>
01:12:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h12m40s">okay, so now</a>
01:12:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h12m42s">you got this complexity problem, and you think: well, you deal with it conceptually</a>
01:12:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h12m47s">and that's sort of akin to the idea that it's belief systems that protect you from death anxiety</a>
01:12:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h12m54s">the ideas are roughly comparable, but again, that's wrong</a>
01:12:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h12m59s">it's the sort of thing only a psychologist could think up</a>
01:12:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h13m02s">because psychologists think that everything about you happens inside your head, so to speak, in your psyche, but that's not true</a>
01:13:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h13m07s">there's a huge chunk of you that's outside of you completely</a>
01:13:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h13m11s">and so, this is a really good example, like, we know the oldest cities, this is a medieval city in France</a>
01:13:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h13m16s">a beautiful old city</a>
01:13:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h13m19s">old cities were walled, and the reason for that was because</a>
01:13:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h13m24s">they were places of wealth, and if you didn't put walls around them then</a>
01:13:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h13m28s">other people would come in and steal everything and kill you</a>
01:13:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h13m31s">so having some walls was a good idea</a>
01:13:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h13m34s">the same as having walls in your house is a good idea</a>
01:13:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h13m37s">walls between your rooms are a good idea, or borders between categories are a good idea</a>
01:13:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h13m43s">and so, part of the way you simplify the world is by building walls around your space, because then a whole bunch of things can't come in</a>
01:13:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h13m50s">and so, you don't even have to think about them; it's not conceptual, it's practical</a>
01:13:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h13m54s">and so, and you know, one of the things I think I've figured out recently</a>
01:13:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h13m59s">is the fundamental political difference between people</a>
01:13:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h14m02s">and it looks to me like the fundamental political difference, is:</a>
01:14:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h14m06s">how many walls should there be around your stuff?</a>
01:14:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h14m09s">and the ultimate liberal answer is: zero</a>
01:14:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h14m13s">and the ultimate conservative answer is: bring on those walls, man!</a>
01:14:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h14m17s">and what's interesting about both those perspectives</a>
01:14:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h14m20s">first of all is that there's temperamental contributions to them, and second that they're both valid</a>
01:14:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h14m25s">so one of the mysteries, I believe, that permeates psychometric psychology right now is</a>
01:14:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h14m33s">why the temperamental factors that influence politics are those particular temperamental factors</a>
01:14:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h14m40s">so there's five, let's say, right, there's classic Big 5: extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness</a>
01:14:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h14m46s">well, the biggest predictors of political allegiance, forget about the politically correct types for a minute</a>
01:14:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h14m52s">but on the liberal to conservative axis is that the liberals are low in conscientiousness and high in openness</a>
01:14:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h14m58s">and the conservatives are high in conscientiousness and low in openness</a>
01:14:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h15m01s">and so then you think, well, why those two traits? that's the first question</a>
01:15:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h15m04s">and the second question is: why those two traits together?</a>
01:15:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h15m08s">given that they're not very highly correlated, right, they're really quite independent</a>
01:15:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h15m12s">so why do they co-vary on the political axis?</a>
01:15:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h15m15s">and I think this is the reason, I think it's exaclty that</a>
01:15:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h15m18s">open people like to live on the periphery of boundaries</a>
01:15:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h15m23s">and they like to break boundaries between things, 'cause interesting things happen when you...</a>
01:15:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h15m27s">when you think a different way, when you think outside of the box, so to speak</a>
01:15:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h15m31s">that's what open people do, they always think outside of the box, no matter what box you put them in</a>
01:15:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h15m36s">you know, and sometimes you meet people that are so open that they're completely disorganized</a>
01:15:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h15m40s">their thought process is almost completely associational, like a dreamer they just jump from one thing to another</a>
01:15:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h15m46s">they're very interesting to talk to, it's very hard for those people to get their lives together</a>
01:15:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h15m50s">'cause they're interested in absolutely everything, and their attention just flits all over the place</a>
01:15:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h15m55s">and so they're open, and that actually does go along with higher intelligence, generally speaking</a>
01:15:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h15m59s">so, and then if they're low in conscientiousness, they don't see any utility in order</a>
01:15:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h16m04s">and orderly people... 'cause that's part of conscientiousness, and the biggest determiner of political belief in the conscientious domain</a>
01:16:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h16m11s">the orderly people like to have everything in its separate place and properly structured</a>
01:16:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h16m17s">and so their world is box inside a box, inside a shelf of boxes</a>
01:16:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h16m22s">and then that shelf of boxes is inside another box, and all those boxes are nice and neat and tight</a>
01:16:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h16m26s">and nothing inside them is touching, and everything in every box is the same thing</a>
01:16:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h16m30s">and you know, you can see that... you can see the utility in that</a>
01:16:30</p>

01:18:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h18m39s">then you set up rules with everybody else that says, well:</a>

01:18:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h18m54s">the issue of discrimination in relationship to sex</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h18m57s">because I've been thinking a lot about discrimination lately, because everybody thinks discrimination is a bad idea</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h19m02s">which is a very stupid proposition, because you're discruminating all the time</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h19m07s">and the most fundamental form of discrimination is choice of sexual partner</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h19m11s">and so you might say, well, why should that even be allowed?</a>

01:19:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h19m17s">so for example, almost everyone is racially prejudiced when it comes to sexual partners</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h19m22s">so you think, well... what about... are you...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h19m35s">right? you'd use it completely if you could get away with it, roughly speaking</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h19m38s">but you can't, because the most attractive people aren't gonna be anywhere near you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h19m43s">so you can't do it, but you'd like to</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h19m54s">so you might say, well, why is that justifiable? and it seems to me that it's something like...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h20m00s">well, you get to say "no" to me if I get to say "no" to you, it's something like that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h20m05s">we've agreed that everybody gets to discriminate on that basis, and because everybody can do it, then it's fair</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h20m12s">it's something like that, it's very much worth thinking about</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h20m41s">and so, it was actually a social  faux-pas to refuse to sleep with someone</a>
01:20:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h20m47s">just as it was a social faux-pas to have any exclusionary relationship</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h20m51s">because another thing you might notice is that there's nothing more discriminatory than falling in love with someone</a>

01:21:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h21m45s">so there's a good schematic of a little house</a>
01:21:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h21m51s">and you can see that even inside the same place we segregate off rooms for different purposes</a>
01:21:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h21m55s">and then, what's interesting, too, is that we set up those rooms as little dramatic spaces; right, so you furnish them</a>
01:21:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h22m02s">and you furnish them with things that tell you how to behave in that room</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h22m11s">they're gonna sit facing each other, and that has certain implications, 'cause the chairs don't face the walls, they face each other</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h22m32s">well, let's sit in the living room, well, you'll probably get a drink if you sit in the living room</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h22m36s">and hypothetically you're gonna have some conversation</a>
01:22:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h22m38s">so it's a bounded place, there are rules that apply</a>
01:22:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h22m42s">and then you get to have a little exploration inside that set of bounded rules, and</a>
01:22:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h22m46s">if you're open, you're gonna discuss all sorts of things, and if you're conservative</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h22m50s">and closed, then you're gonna discuss a very, very small subset of things</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h22m55s">and so, hopefully everyone will agree on that</a>
01:22:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h22m58s">so that's one form of binding</a>
01:22:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h23m01s">then another is: we put boxes around each other when it comes to groups</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h23m23s">and they basically do that on  temperamental grounds, fundamentally</a>
01:23:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h23m27s">and then they produce these games that everyone knows how to play</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h23m54s">and the reason for that is that there's a set of procedures in place that have some historical justification</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h24m01s">that are embedded within a shared cultural and belief system</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h27m06s">and I do... I put the first picture there of the central nervous system that controls voluntary movement, for example</a>
01:27:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h27m15s">I put it there because people like to think that their brain is in their head</a>
01:27:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h27m20s">but it's a stupid way of thinking about it, as far as I'm concerned, because</a>
01:27:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h27m24s">you have an awful lot of neurological tissue distributed through your body, and</a>
01:27:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h27m28s">like your autonomic nervous system, if I remember correctly, which is mostly distributed through your body</a>
01:27:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h27m32s">has more neurons in it than your central nervous system, and so</a>
01:27:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h27m35s">you aren't a brain in a body, your brain is really distributed through your whole body</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h27m42s">and I think the idea that you have a brain in a body is kind of a holdover from the idea that you have a soul in a body</a>
01:27:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h27m50s">not that I'm necessarily criticizing that idea, but I think they kinda got graften onto one another, and so</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h27m57s">but the problem with that is that it...</a>
01:27:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h28m01s">so it's the soul-body, brain-body, mind-body dichotomy, which I think is the same dichotomy</a>
01:28:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h28m09s">and the problem with that is that it's easy to think of thought as something that's abstracted away from the body</a>
01:28:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h28m16s">I think that was an enlightenment idea</a>
01:28:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h28m20s">that just like the soul shouldn't be contaminated by the demands of the body, if you were going to be pure spiritually</a>
01:28:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h28m27s">so your thought shouldn't be contaminated by your subjectivity, and your emotions</a>
01:28:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h28m32s">and your motivations, and all of that</a>
01:28:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h28m34s">it should... your abstractions should be independent of your subjectivity</a>
01:28:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h28m40s">and rationality and emotion are construed in that manner as enemies</a>
01:28:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h28m47s">the purpose of rationality is to dispense with the irrationality of emotion and motivation</a>
01:28:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h28m54s">and that's... Freud's idea of the properly functioning ego is something like that, too</a>
01:28:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h28m59s">because the Id is this place of compulsion and drive</a>
01:28:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h29m03s">and the ego has to basically suppress that in the service of the superego</a>
01:29:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h29m09s">there's no idea of integration, really, in Freud</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h29m12s">now, I don't wanna be rough on Freud</a>
01:29:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h29m14s">and I think part of the reason that he thought that way is because the patients he had</a>
01:29:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h29m20s">were precisely those who weren't very well integrated because of their pathological past</a>
01:29:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h29m26s">and so they didn't know how to get those subsystems up into the overarching game</a>
01:29:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h29m31s">and so their only alternative was something like suppression or repression</a>
01:29:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h29m37s">because if you don't know how to be aggressive in a sophisticated way</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h29m43s">you're still gonna be aggressive, but you're gonna have to inhibit it, control yourself</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h29m49s">because you can't just be aggressive around people, it just won't go well for you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h29m53s">so if you can't do it in a sophisticated way, you're gonna repress it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h29m56s">or you're gonna get in trouble, those are the options, so...</a>
01:29:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h30m01s">okay, but if you start thinking about the brain, the nervous system as part of the body</a>
01:30:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h30m06s">as an inseparable part, well then the function of thinking seems to become something different</a>
01:30:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h30m12s">it's not so much the objective, abstract representation of the world</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h30m16s">which is kinda what you're pursuing if you're a scientist, it's more like...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h30m23s">it's more like conceptualization of and practice of the proper way of being in the world</a>
01:30:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h30m31s">and I think that's what you're more interested in anyways, I don't see how you can't be, since</a>
01:30:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h30m37s">you're a living thing, and you're overwhelmingly motivated to</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h30m55s">and it's complicated, you can boil it down to survival and reproduction, it's a good overarching simplification</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h31m04s">but there's nothing simple about survival and reproduction, I mean</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h31m15s">but it's not unreasonable to assume that one of the things that people generally want to do is to continue living in as pain-free manner as possible</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h31m22s">it's something like that, although that's a simplification</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h31m26s">so now the reason I'm making that case is because</a>
01:31:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h31m30s">the fact that you have a body and the fact that you have a nervous system is another set of limitations on</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h31m37s">how it is that you're going to interact with the world</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h31m39s">so now we've got the nervous system, we can go to higher resolutions - you say you have a brain</a>
01:31:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h31m45s">and the brain... that's the frontal cortex there</a>
01:31:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h31m50s">and that's the temporal cortex there, and that's the parietal cortex there, and that's the sensory cortex there</a>
01:31:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h31m57s">and these were, if I remember properly, these were divisions that I think were first</a>
01:31:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h32m04s">thought through in the late XIX and early XX century</a>
01:32:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h32m08s">they're slightly specialized</a>
01:32:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h32m12s">so this cortex back here does a lot of the elaboration of vision</a>
01:32:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h32m17s">and that one there helps you with your sense of embodiment and your knowledge about where your body actually happens to be localized</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h32m25s">and that one helps for example in some elements of language output, and</a>
01:32:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h32m31s">then the frontal cortex, especially the prefrontal part, which is up here</a>

01:32:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h32m42s">that's a good way of thinking about it, you've got</a>
01:32:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h32m45s">part of your brain that deals with the sensory world</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h32m47s">and the integration of the sensory world, which seems to happen about there, where these places meet</a>
01:32:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h32m54s">and the prefrontal cortex grew out of the motor cortex</a>
01:32:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h32m59s">the motor cortex helps you plan out voluntary actions</a>
01:32:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h33m05s">the prefrontal cortex grew out of that in the course of evolution</a>
01:33:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h33m08s">so you might think, well, there's reflex actions</a>
01:33:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h33m12s">and they happen when something happens to you, you resond</a>
01:33:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h33m16s">and then that elaborates up into the motor system, and that enables you to act voluntarily in the world</a>
01:33:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h33m21s">and then that elaborates up into the prefrontal motor system, which helps you plan how you might act in the world</a>
01:33:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h33m28s">so it's the prefrontal cortex that's the home of, let's call it, complex, sophisticated, voluntary thought</a>
01:33:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h33m34s">which you could think about as a way of representing the world</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h33m49s">and so, I think that's why...</a>
01:33:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h33m51s">one of the weird things that you discover psychometrically</a>
01:33:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h33m55s">is that there's no correlation between conscientiousness and intelligence</a>
01:33:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h34m00s">and that's a weird one, because people think about intelligence as planning and forward thinking and all of that</a>
01:34:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h34m06s">but that's also how they think about conscientiousness</a>
01:34:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h34m09s">as planful behavior and the consideration of future possibilities, but</a>
01:34:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h34m15s">intelligence and conscientiousness have zero correlation</a>
01:34:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h34m19s">so you think, well, why is that? I guess it has to be that way, because</a>
01:34:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h34m24s">you couldn't think abstractly if you were prone to act out what you thought</a>
01:34:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h34m28s">you'd just go and act it out</a>
01:34:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h34m30s">I mentioned this to you before, when you dream, you're paralyzed</a>
01:34:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h34m34s">and you can take that little part of the brain that produces that paralysis out of a cat</a>
01:34:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h34m39s">or out of a person, but we haven't done it with people</a>
01:34:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h34m42s">out of a cat, and then when the cat falls asleep, it hits REM sleep, it'll run around until it runs into something, and then it'll wake up</a>
01:34:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h34m48s">so the dream thinking is so tightly allied with action that</a>
01:34:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h34m54s">there's no separation between them, so there's no real abstraction there</a>
01:34:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h34m58s">if you couldn't abstract, you wouldn't be able to think</a>
01:34:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h35m02s">and the fact that you can abstract means that you can separate your thinking from your action</a>
01:35:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h35m06s">so that's why, as far as I can tell, there's very little correlation between conscientiousness and intelligence</a>
01:35:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h35m11s">it's like it has to be that way, because you have to be able to think about things that you wouldn't do, if you're going to think</a>
01:35:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h35m17s">and generally we think of people who act as soon as they think as impulsive</a>
01:35:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h35m25s">so...</a>
01:35:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h35m29s">there's a huge part of the brain that's devoted to sensory processing</a>
01:35:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h35m33s">and there's a huge part of the brain that's devoted to planning</a>
01:35:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h35m37s">and the whole prefrontal part of the brain is devoted to planning</a>
01:35:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h35m40s">and what that indicates is that in large part</a>
01:35:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h35m45s">as far as your evolved body is concerned</a>
01:35:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h35m48s">the reason that you think is so that you can act better</a>
01:35:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h35m52s">and of course that makes sense</a>
01:35:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h35m54s">and you can think about memory from that perspective, too, because</a>
01:35:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h35m58s">if you think scientifically, you think that your memory of the world is something like an objective record of events, of objective events</a>
01:35:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h36m04s">but it's really not very much like that at all</a>
01:36:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h36m08s">and besides, who cares?</a>
01:36:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h36m11s">you don't need an accurate representation of all the facts about this room</a>
01:36:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h36m15s">in fact, all it would do is weigh you down</a>
01:36:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h36m17s">who cares what color the walls are? or what color the ceiling is?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h36m20s">or what color the paint is; all of that's not worth remembering</a>
01:36:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h36m25s">partly 'cause it has no relationship whatsoever to what you need to do in order to continue to act</a>
01:36:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h36m31s">and so what you're doing when you remember, as far as I can tell</a>
01:36:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h36m34s">is that you're mining your experience for information that you can bring forward into the future</a>
01:36:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h36m39s">it's purely pragmatic, and so...</a>
01:36:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h36m43s">I treat people who have post-traumatic disorder or symptoms of post-traumatic disorder</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h36m50s">and so, let's say they got post-traumatic stress disorder because</a>
01:36:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h36m55s">again, because a relationship collapsed on them suddenly, which is quite common</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h36m59s">you know, they get betrayed or someone leaves them suddenly, and then they don't know what to do, because</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h37m05s">especially if they're conscientious, because then they just tear themselves to pieces trying to figure out what they did wrong</a>
01:37:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h37m10s">to bring about that event</a>
01:37:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h37m12s">and the reason they're doing that is that they wanna retool their perceptions and their actions</a>
01:37:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h37m17s">so that the probability that they'll have the same experience again is minimized</a>

01:37:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h37m30s">the first thing you should figure out is how to not fall into big pits anymore</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h38m10s">but the problem is that, say if it's the collapse of a relationship and you've been with that person for eight years or longer</a>
01:38:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h38m18s">well, you did so many things with them</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h38m22s">that the idea that you did something wrong pretty much extends to every single thing you ever did with them</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h40m00s">or maybe you smarter, depending on who you're with; it's like, no, probably not, a bit, maybe</a>
01:40:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h40m06s">so you do a situational analysis</a>
01:40:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h40m10s">and so what you're trying to do is to extract out information from your past and your present that will enable you to conduct yourself properly into the future</a>
01:40:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h40m18s">and so that's another example of the pragmatic element of thought</a>
01:40:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h40m23s">well then, within the brain itself, apart from the major subdivisions which we just described, there are</a>
01:40:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h40m30s">minor subdivisions, and here's a bunch of them listed</a>
01:40:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h40m33s">the caudate nucleus, the cerebral cortex, a huge, newest part of the brain</a>
01:40:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h40m38s">that's about a square meter if you unfold it, it's all folded up</a>
01:40:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h40m42s">and most of the processing occurs right on the surface, that's the idea, anyways</a>
01:40:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h40m47s">the thalamus, that's a place where a lot of the information in the brain appears to be integrated</a>
01:40:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h40m51s">the cerebellum helps you with balance and the sequencing of complex motor activities</a>
01:40:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h40m56s">the hippocampus, that's the one we talked about before</a>
01:40:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h40m59s">one of the things that the hippocampus does, seems to do, is compare your model of the world as it's unfolding with the model that</a>
01:40:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h41m06s">that you desire to be ocurring, and then keeps track of mismatches</a>
01:41:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h41m11s">and if it detects a mismatch, then it disinhibits other emotional and motivational centers</a>
01:41:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h41m16s">and that's the beginning of your response to the unknown, so...</a>
01:41:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h41m21s">one of them is the hypothalamus, I'm gonna concentrate on it for a bit</a>
01:41:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h41m25s">it's a little, tiny part of the brain that's  pretty much at the top of the spinal cord, see it's really small</a>
01:41:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h41m31s">compared to the rest of the brain</a>
01:41:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h41m33s">now, imagine this is a cat brain for a minute</a>
01:41:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h41m37s">and you take off the whole cat brain except for the hypothalamus</a>
01:41:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h41m42s">which people do, you take off the whole cortex, for example</a>
01:41:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h41m46s">and then the cat's still alive if you do it carefully</a>
01:41:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h41m50s">but it doesn't have much of a brain, and so you might think, well that cat would just do nothing, but it...</a>
01:41:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h41m55s">cat's actually pretty functional if it's reduced just to it's hypothalamus</a>
01:41:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h41m59s">and that's because the hypothalamus is an incredibly important part of the brain</a>
01:41:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h42m03s">and it provides what I would say constitute the major frames, the maojr psychological frames</a>
01:42:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h42m09s">and so,  a decorticate cat can stil eat and drink</a>
01:42:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h42m15s">and regulate its body temperature, and engage in defensive aggression</a>
01:42:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h42m19s">and if it's female, it can still mate, male can't, 'cause the male mating behavior is more complicated</a>
01:42:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h42m24s">and as long as you keep it in a bounded environment, it can function reasonably well</a>
01:42:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h42m31s">it's hypercurious, though</a>
01:42:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h42m34s">which is very weird, because you wouldn't expect a cat with no brain to be curious about anything</a>
01:42:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h42m38s">but a cat with no brain is curious about everything</a>
01:42:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h42m40s">and that seems to be because...</a>
01:42:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h42m42s">part of the reason that you aren't curious about something anymore is 'cause you've investigated it</a>
01:42:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h42m46s">and you've built a representation of it that's functional</a>
01:42:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h42m50s">and that functional representation then stands for the thing itself</a>
01:42:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h42m54s">and then you can ignore it, and so you learn to ignore things</a>
01:42:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h42m57s">they're interesting to begin with, and then you learn to ignore them</a>
01:42:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h43m00s">and so, one of the things that I think artists do, if they're great artists</a>
01:43:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h43m04s">is remind you that there's more to things than you see now that you've learned to ignore them</a>
01:43:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h43m10s">so you get a kind of a halucinogenic painting of flower, like van Gogh might produce</a>
01:43:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h43m15s">like his famous irises, which I think sold for like 220 milion dollars or something outrageous</a>
01:43:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h43m20s">it's like what van Gogh is trying to show you is what those flowers looked like before you thought you could see them</a>
01:43:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h43m26s">'cause now: "flower", and you walk by, you don't see it at all</a>
01:43:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h43m30s">'cause you're off to get a peanut butter sandwich or something</a>

01:43:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h43m38s">alright, so we're gonna zoom in on the hypothalamus here</a>
01:43:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h43m44s">and what you see, of course, when you zoom in on the hypothalamus, is that it's not a thing</a>
01:43:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h43m50s">it's a whole bunch of things</a>
01:43:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h43m52s">and then it's one of those horrible whole bunches of things that are made out of even more bunches of things, and then they're made out of more bunches of things, and</a>
01:43:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h43m59s">what's really interesting about going down the body from an analytic perspective</a>
01:43:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h44m04s">is that it doesn't seem to get less complex as you go farther down, you know</a>
01:44:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h44m08s">some of the... I should actually show you that...</a>
01:44:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h44m12s">I haven't shown you that little video of DNA fixing itself, eh?</a>
01:44:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h44m17s">I better show you that, it's so cool, it's ridiculously cool, so you definitely need to see it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h44m24s">&gt;&gt;untill I encountered the artworks of David Goodsell, I was a molecular biologist at the Scrips (?) Institute</a>
01:44:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h44m31s">&gt;&gt;and these pictures are all... everything's accurate, it's all to scale</a>
01:44:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h44m34s">&gt;&gt;and his work illuminated for me what the molecular world inside us is like</a>
01:44:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h44m40s">&gt;&gt;so this is a trans-section through blood, in the top left hand corner you've got this yellow-green area</a>
01:44:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h44m45s">&gt;&gt;the yellow-green area is the fluids of blood, which is mostly water, but it's also antibodies, sugars</a>
01:44:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h44m49s">&gt;&gt;hormones, that kind of thing</a>
01:44:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h44m51s">&gt;&gt;and the red region is a slice into a red blood cell, and those red molecules are hemoglobin</a>
01:44:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h44m55s">&gt;&gt;they are actually red, that's what gives blood its color</a>
01:44:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h44m57s">&gt;&gt;and hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge to soak up the oxygen in your lungs and carry it to other parts in the body</a>
01:44:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h45m03s">&gt;&gt;I was very much inspired by this image many years ago</a>
01:45:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h45m06s">&gt;&gt;and I wondered whether we could use computer graphics to represent the molecular world, what would it look like?</a>
01:45:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h45m11s">&gt;&gt;and that's how I really began, so let's begin</a>
01:45:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h45m15s">&gt;&gt;this is DNA in its classic double helix for, and it's from x-ray crystallography, so it's an accurate model of DNA</a>
01:45:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h45m21s">&gt;&gt;if we unwind the double helix and unzip the two strands, you see these things that look like teeth</a>
01:45:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h45m26s">&gt;&gt;those are the letters of the genetic code, the 25 000 genes you've got written in your DNA</a>
01:45:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h45m30s">&gt;&gt;this is what they typically talk about, the genetic code, this is what they're talking about</a>
01:45:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h45m34s">&gt;&gt;but I wanna talk about a different aspect of DNA science, and that is the physical nature of DNA</a>
01:45:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h45m39s">&gt;&gt;and it's these two strands that run in opposite directions for reasons I can't go into right now</a>
01:45:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h45m44s">&gt;&gt;but they physically run in opposite directions, which creates a number of complications for your living cells</a>
01:45:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h45m50s">&gt;&gt;as you're about to see; most particularly when DNA is being copied</a>
01:45:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h45m54s">&gt;&gt;and so, what I'm about to show you is an accurate representation of the actual DNA replication machine</a>
01:45:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h46m00s">&gt;&gt;that's occurring right now inside your body, at least 2002 biology</a>
01:46:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h46m04s">&gt;&gt;DNA is entering the production line from the left-hand side</a>
01:46:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h46m08s">&gt;&gt;and it hits this collection, this miniature biochemical machines that are</a>
01:46:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h46m11s">&gt;&gt;pulling apart the DNA strand and making an exact copy</a>
01:46:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h46m14s">&gt;&gt;so DNA comes in and hits this blue doughnut-shaped structure, and it's ripped apart into its two strands</a>
01:46:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h46m20s">&gt;&gt;one strand can be copied directly, and you can see these things spooling off down to the bottom there</a>
01:46:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h46m24s">&gt;&gt;but things aren't so simple for the other strands, because it must be copied backwards</a>
01:46:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h46m28s">&gt;&gt;so it's thrown out repeatedly in these loops, and copied one section at a time</a>
01:46:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h46m32s">&gt;&gt;creating two new DNA molecules</a>
01:46:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h46m35s">&gt;&gt;now you have billions of this machine right now working inside you, copying your DNA with exquisite fidelity</a>
01:46:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h46m43s">&gt;&gt;it's an accurate representation, and it's pretty much at the correct speed for at what is occurring inside you</a>
01:46:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h46m48s">&gt;&gt;but I've left out error correction and a bunch of other things</a>
01:46:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h46m52s">[applause] &gt;&gt;this was work from a number of years ago; thank you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h46m57s">&gt;&gt;this is work from a number of years ago, but what I'll show you next is updated science, it's updated technology</a>
01:46:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h47m03s">&gt;&gt;so again we begin with DNA, and it's jiggling and wiggling there because of the surrounding supermolecules, which are stripped away so you can see something</a>
01:47:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h47m09s">&gt;&gt;DNA is about two nanometers across, which is really quite tiny</a>
01:47:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h47m13s">&gt;&gt;but in each one of your cells, each strand of DNA is about 30 to 40 million nanometers long</a>
01:47:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h47m19s">&gt;&gt;so to keep the DNA organized and regulate access to the genetic code it's wrapped around these purple proteins, I've labeled them purple here</a>
01:47:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h47m27s">&gt;&gt;It's packaged up in bundles [?], all this field of view is a single strand of DNA</a>
01:47:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h47m31s">&gt;&gt;this huge package od DNA is called a chromosome, and we'll come back to chromosomes in a minute</a>
01:47:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h47m37s">&gt;&gt;we're pulling out, we're zooming out</a>
01:47:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h47m39s">&gt;&gt;out through a nuclear pore, which is sort of the gateway to this compartment</a>
01:47:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h47m43s">&gt;&gt;that holds all the DNA, called the nucleus</a>
01:47:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h47m46s">&gt;&gt;all of this field of view is about a semester's worth of biology, and I've got 7 minutes, so we're not gonna be able to do that today</a>
01:47:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h47m55s">&gt;&gt;no, I'm being told no</a>
01:47:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h47m57s">&gt;&gt;this is the way a living cell looks down a live microscope</a>
01:47:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h48m01s">&gt;&gt;and it's been filmed under time lapse, which is why you can see it moving</a>
01:48:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h48m04s">&gt;&gt;the nuclear envelope breaks down; these sausage-shaped things are the chromosomes, and we'll focus on them</a>
01:48:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h48m08s">&gt;&gt;they go through this very striking motion that is focused on these little red spots</a>
01:48:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h48m14s">&gt;&gt;when the cell feels it's ready to go, it rips apart the chromosome</a>
01:48:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h48m18s">&gt;&gt;one set of DNA goes to one side, the other side gets the other set of DNA</a>
01:48:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h48m22s">&gt;&gt;identical copies of DNA; and then the cell splits down the middle</a>
01:48:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h48m26s">&gt;&gt;and again, you have billions of cells undergoing this process right now inside of you</a>
01:48:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h48m31s">&gt;&gt;now we're gonna rewind and just focus on the chromosomes</a>
01:48:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h48m34s">&gt;&gt;and look at tis structure, and describe it</a>
01:48:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h48m37s">&gt;&gt;so again, here we are at that equator moment</a>
01:48:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h48m40s">&gt;&gt;the chromosomes line up, and if we isolate just one chromosome, we're gonna pull it out and have a look at its structure</a>
01:48:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h48m45s">&gt;&gt;so this is one of the biggest molecular structures that you have, at least as we've discovered so far inside of us</a>
01:48:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h48m53s">&gt;&gt;so this is a single chromosome, and you have two strands of DNA in each chromosome</a>
01:48:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h48m57s">&gt;&gt;one is bundled up into one sausage, the other strand  is bundled up into the other sausage</a>
01:48:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h49m02s">&gt;&gt;these things that look like whiskers that are sticking out from either side are the dynamic scaffolding of the cell</a>
01:49:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h49m07s">&gt;&gt;they're called microtubules, but the name's not important; but we're gonna focus on this red region, I've labaled it red here</a>
01:49:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h49m12s">&gt;&gt;and it's the interface between the dynamic scaffolding and the chromosomes</a>
01:49:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h49m17s">&gt;&gt;it is obviously central fo the movement of the chromosomes</a>
01:49:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h49m20s">&gt;&gt;but we have no idea, really, as to how it's achieving that movement</a>
01:49:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h49m24s">&gt;&gt;we've been studying this thing they call the kinetic core for over a hundred years with intense study</a>
01:49:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h49m28s">&gt;&gt;and we're still just beginning to discover what it's all about</a>
01:49:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h49m31s">&gt;&gt;it is made up of about two hundred different types of proteins, thousands of proteins in total</a>
01:49:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h49m36s">&gt;&gt;it is a signal broadcasting system</a>
01:49:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h49m39s">&gt;&gt;it broadcasts through chemical signals, telling the rest of the cell when it's ready</a>
01:49:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h49m44s">&gt;&gt;when it feels that everything is aligned and ready to go for the separation of the chromosomes</a>
01:49:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h49m49s">&gt;&gt;it is able to couple onto the growing and shrinking microtubules</a>
01:49:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h49m53s">&gt;&gt;(?) it's involved in the growing of the microtubules, and it's able to transiently couple onto them</a>
01:49:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h49m58s">&gt;&gt;it's also a tension-sensing system, it's able to feel when the cell is ready,  when the chromosome is correctly positioned</a>
01:49:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h50m05s">&gt;&gt;it's turning green here, because it feels that everything is just right</a>
01:50:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h50m09s">&gt;&gt;and you'll see there's this one little last bit, that's still remaining red</a>
01:50:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h50m12s">&gt;&gt;and it's walked away down the microtubules</a>
01:50:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h50m16s">&gt;&gt;that is the signal broadcasting system sending out the stop signal, and it's walked away, it's that mechanical</a>
01:50:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h50m23s">&gt;&gt;it's molecular clockwork, this is how you work at the molecular scale</a>
01:50:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h50m27s">&gt;&gt;so with a little bit of molecular eye candy...</a>
01:50:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h50m31s">&gt;&gt;we've got kinesines, which are tho orange ones, they're little molecular courier molecules walking one way</a>
01:50:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h50m36s">&gt;&gt;and here are the dionine(?), they're carrying that red broadasting system, and they've got their long legs so they can step around obstacles and so on</a>
01:50:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h50m41s">&gt;&gt;so again, this is all derived accurately from the science, the problem is we can't show it to you any other way</a>
01:50:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h50m48s">&gt;&gt;exploring at the frontier of science, at the frontier of human understanding is mindblowing</a>
01:50:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h50m55s">&gt;&gt;discovering this stuff is certainly a pleasurable incentive to work in science</a>
01:50:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h51m01s">&gt;&gt;but most medical researchers...</a>
01:51:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h51m04s">&gt;&gt;this is just... discovering this stuff is simply steps along the path to the big goals</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h51m08s">&gt;&gt;which are to eradicate disease, to eliminate the suffering and the misery that disease causes and to lift people out of poverty, thank you</a>

01:51:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h51m19s">so like that's just so ridiculously mindblowing that it's amost unbearable</a>
01:51:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h51m25s">to think about that as clockwork even is a pretty strange idea</a>
01:51:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h51m29s">because those little things walk over obstacles, how the hell does that happen? they're just molecules</a>
01:51:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h51m35s">so it's so cool, 'cause when you go down you think "simple", but you know</a>
01:51:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h51m40s">and he said at the beginning, when the little machines were taking the DNA apart that he didn't show the error correcting</a>
01:51:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h51m48s">there are these other little machines that go along and see if everything's okay, and if it isn't, they cut it out and put the right piece in</a>
01:51:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h51m55s">yeah, things we don't understand, there's no shortage of them, that's for sure</a>
01:51:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h52m00s">okay, so</a>
01:52:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h52m02s">what I'm doing in some sense is walking you though a psychophysiological representation of</a>
01:52:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h52m08s">Piaget's developmental process, I would say</a>
01:52:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h52m12s">I wanted to zero in on the hypothalamus, becaue it seems to me the thing that sets the most basic frames</a>
01:52:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h52m19s">and so, we'll go ahead with that</a>
01:52:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h52m24s">so you see that it's made up of all these little parts</a>
01:52:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h52m28s">so it's called the hypothalamus more for convenience than because it's a homogeneous set of structures</a>
01:52:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h52m35s">'cause it's not a homogeous set of structures</a>
01:52:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h52m38s">this is something to consider very carefully when you're thinking about the terminology that psychologists use</a>
01:52:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h52m42s">or that you might use to describe your own behavior</a>
01:52:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h52m46s">'cause you know, you can roughly... there is a psychology of motivation and there's a psychology of emotion</a>
01:52:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h52m51s">and you might think, well, emotion and motivation are categorically different entities</a>
01:52:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h52m55s">but they're not</a>
01:52:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h52m57s">in fact, there's no such thing as a uniform set of motivations, and there's no such thing as a uniform set of emotions</a>
01:52:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h53m03s">and the distinction between a motivation and an emotion is unclear, to say the least</a>
01:53:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h53m08s">and that's partly because the physiological substructures that subsume what we call motivations and what we call emotions</a>
01:53:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h53m16s">it's not like there's a motivation center that's homogeneous</a>
01:53:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h53m20s">the closest is the hypothalamus, but it's made of structures that are qualitatively different</a>
01:53:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h53m25s">and then the emotions... 'cause I have to use that descriptive terminology, 'cause we have to communicate about it somehow</a>
01:53:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h53m32s">there's all sorts of different structures in the brain that contribute to emotional expression</a>
01:53:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h53m36s">they're not even in the same place</a>
01:53:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h53m40s">much less composed of identical structure or function</a>
01:53:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h53m44s">so you know, we have shorthands that we use to divide up the world, but they're...</a>
01:53:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h53m49s">they're awkward and untenable as the level of resolution increases</a>
01:53:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h53m53s">but anyways, I'm still gonna go with motivation and emotion, becasue it's a useful simplification</a>
01:53:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h53m58s">but you can see with the hypothalamus that there's all these complicated little subsystems in there</a>
01:53:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h54m03s">and I showed you that video to show you just how complicated the subsystems are</a>
01:54:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h54m07s">all the way down to the molecular level</a>
01:54:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h54m11s">how those little machines manage what they do is completely beyond me</a>
01:54:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h54m15s">they call it clockwork when those little things that walk can walk over obstacles</a>
01:54:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h54m19s">it's like: clockwork does one thing only</a>
01:54:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h54m23s">click, click, click, click, that's all it does, no exceptions</a>
01:54:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h54m27s">this thing walks over obstacles to get where it's going; who knows what's going on down there?</a>
01:54:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h54m33s">but it works well enough, so here we are, weirdly enough</a>
01:54:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h54m37s">so motivation seems to be to be the initial  framing process</a>
01:54:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h54m42s">and you come in to the world with the motivational systems roughly ready to go</a>
01:54:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h54m47s">babies are hungry, babies get cold, babies want something to drink</a>
01:54:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h54m52s">so the world already comes...</a>
01:54:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h54m55s">in some sense they come into the world with pre-packaged categories for existence</a>
01:54:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h55m00s">and those are the categories that are going to aid their survival</a>
01:55:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h55m04s">and you know, they're not simple, either; it's not so simple</a>
01:55:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h55m07s">it's hunger, thirst, pleasure, pain, anxiety,</a>
01:55:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h55m11s">and the classic emotions: sadness, joy, and so forth</a>
01:55:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h55m16s">those systems are already there, but babies have more complicated systems, too</a>
01:55:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h55m20s">like the system for exploration is already in place, and the system for play</a>
01:55:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h55m24s">which is really complicated, it's already in place, so</a>
01:55:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h55m27s">you come into the world with a human nature</a>
01:55:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h55m31s">and the nature seems to be distributed across the subsystems, that's one way of thinking about it</a>
01:55:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h55m36s">and it's also useful to think about the operation of those subsystems as something like...</a>
01:55:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h55m40s">you can think abouth them as games with an aim</a>
01:55:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h55m44s">you could think about them as stories, you could think about them as frames of reference, you can think about them as action patterns</a>
01:55:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h55m51s">all of those, and you can think abouth them as subpersonalities, which I actually think is maybe the best way to think about them</a>
01:55:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h55m56s">because if you're hungry, it's not a deterministic drive</a>
01:55:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h56m01s">it's a subpersonality that has a goal</a>
01:56:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h56m04s">and then it has a bunch of action patterns that are going to work in reference to that goal</a>
01:56:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h56m08s">it has a bunch of perceptions that suit that goal</a>
01:56:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h56m12s">and it organizes your emotional responses around that goal</a>
01:56:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h56m15s">and so, to think about it as a personality is a much more intelligent way to look at it</a>
01:56:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h56m21s">one of the things about Skinner's rats... you know, Skinner could get rats to do almost anything, and he would reward them with food</a>
01:56:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h56m27s">and so he had a simple rat model, but his rats were starved down to 75% of their normal body weight</a>
01:56:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h56m33s">so not only were they not social, gregarious ratts, like rats are, 'cause they were isolated</a>
01:56:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h56m38s">they were genetically altered from wild rats</a>
01:56:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h56m42s">but they also weren't as complex as a real rat, because they were starvind, and so</a>
01:56:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h56m46s">but you know, a starving rat is a prety good model of a rat</a>
01:56:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h56m49s">and a rat is a pretty good model of a person</a>
01:56:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h56m51s">but a lot of our models of simple behavior learning were based on starving, isolated rats, so anyways</a>
01:56:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h56m59s">how to think about motivation? we'll think about it from the hypothalamic perspective</a>
01:56:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h57m04s">so we could say one thing that motivation does is set goals</a>
01:57:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h57m07s">we could say that emotions track progress towards goals</a>
01:57:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h57m11s">and I'm gonna use that schema, even though it's not exactly right</a>
01:57:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h57m14s">so you say, well, motivation determines where you're gonna aim, so if you're hungry, you're gonna aim at something to eat</a>
01:57:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h57m19s">and then that will organize your perceptions, so that you zero out everything that isn't relevant to that task</a>
01:57:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h57m25s">which is almost everything</a>
01:57:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h57m27s">you concentrate on those few things that are gonna facilitate your movement forward</a>
01:57:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h57m31s">when you encounter those things, that produces positive emotion</a>
01:57:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h57m34s">as you move throught the world towards your goal and you see that things are alying themselves out, that facilitate your movement forward</a>
01:57:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h57m41s">those things cause positive emotion</a>
01:57:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h57m43s">and if you encounter anything that gets in the way, then that produces negative emotion</a>
01:57:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h57m47s">and it can be like threat, 'cause you're not supposed to encounter something that gets in the way</a>
01:57:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h57m52s">it can be anger, so that you move it away, it can be frustration, disappointment, grief, those would...</a>
01:57:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h57m57s">if you have a response that serious to an obstacle, it would probably punish the little motivated frame right out of existence</a>
01:57:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h58m04s">so you walk downstairs and I don't know, the contracting company sent a wrecking ball through your kitchen</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h58m10s">that's gonna be disappointing</a>

01:58:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h58m21s">and one of the things we're gonna try to sort out is how do you decide</a>
01:58:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h58m25s">when you've encountered an obstacle that's so big that you should just quit and go do something else</a>
01:58:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h58m30s">'cause that's not obvious</a>
01:58:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h58m33s">you can get into counterproductive persistence pretty easily</a>
01:58:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h58m37s">we don't know how people solve that problem, it's a really complicated one</a>
01:58:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h58m41s">so anyways, we're gonna work on that scenario</a>
01:58:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h58m43s">your hypothalamus pops up micro-goals that are directly relevant to biological survival</a>
01:58:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h58m49s">that produces a frame of reference</a>
01:58:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h58m52s">so it's not a goal, and it's not a drive, and it's not a collection of behaviors, it's a little personality</a>
01:58:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h58m58s">and the little personality has a viewpoint, it has thoughts that go along with it</a>
01:58:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h59m02s">it has perceptions, it has action tendencies, all of that</a>
01:59:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h59m06s">you can see this in addiction, most particularly</a>
01:59:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h59m10s">so one of the things that you find often with people who are alcoholic is they lie all the time</a>
01:59:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h59m15s">and that's because when they built a little alcohol-dependent personality inside of themselves</a>
01:59:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h59m21s">or a big one, maybe it's 90% of their personality</a>
01:59:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h59m25s">and one of the things that consists of</a>
01:59:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h59m29s">is all the rationalizations that they've used over the years to justify their addiction to themselves and to other people</a>
01:59:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h59m35s">and so the addiction has a personality</a>
01:59:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h59m39s">and so when the person is off...</a>
01:59:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h59m41s">maybe they're addicted to meth or something like that, where we know the addiction is more...</a>
01:59:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h59m46s">it's more short-term powerful than, I would say, an alcohol addiction</a>
01:59:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h59m50s">they'll say anything, and the words are just tools to get towards the goal</a>
01:59:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=01h59m56s">and if they happen to be deceptive, whatever, it doesn't matter, they're just practical tools to get towards the goal</a>
01:59:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h00m01s">and then when you get towards a goal, you take a nice shot of meth or something like that</a>
02:00:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h00m05s">you reinforce all those rationales that you used to get the drug, and the next time you're even a better deceiver and liar</a>
02:00:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h00m13s">so we're gonna say, motivations, one way of thinking about it is they set goals, but it's not the right way of thinking about it</a>
02:00:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h00m19s">they produce a whole framework of interpretation, and so we're gonna think about that framework of interpretation</a>
02:00:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h00m24s">and then emotions emerge inside of that</a>
02:00:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h00m27s">so the world is framed, motivation set goals, you could say the world has to be framed</a>
02:00:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h00m33s">so motivation sets that frame: goals, emotions, perceptions and actions</a>
02:00:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h00m37s">and then the actions (he means emotions) track progress, so</a>
02:00:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h00m39s">positive emotion says: you're moving forward properly towards your goal</a>
02:00:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h00m44s">and if you encounter something you don't expect, you stop, that's anxiety</a>
02:00:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h00m48s">it's like: oh! we're not where we thought we were</a>
02:00:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h00m50s">and so we don't know what to do, so we should stop, 'cause we don't know where we are and what we're doing; stop, frozen</a>
02:00:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h00m56s">and then the more powerful negative emotions like pain, they might make you get out of theres, so...</a>
02:00:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h01m03s">emotions: forward, stop, reverse; that's your emotions within that motivated frame</a>
02:01:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h01m09s">and that's another example of how your mind is embedded in your body</a>
02:01:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h01m14s">emotions are offshoots of action tendencies, that's the right way to think about it</a>
02:01:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h01m20s">'cause action is everything, fundamentally</a>
02:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h01m23s">so what are some basic motivations?</a>
02:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h01m26s">most of these are regulated by the hypothalamus, by the way, and that tells you just how important a control system it is</a>
02:01:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h01m31s">the other that's useful to know about the hypothalamus is that it has projections going up from it that are like tree trunks</a>
02:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h01m37s">and inhibitory projections coming down that are like grape vines</a>
02:01:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h01m42s">so you can kinda control your hypothalamus as long as it's not on too much, but</a>
02:01:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h01m46s">if it's on in any serious way, its like... it wins</a>
02:01:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h01m51s">so partly what you do to stop yourself from falling under the dominion of your hypothalamus</a>
02:01:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h01m57s">is to never, ever be anywhere where its action is necessary</a>
02:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h02m01s">right? you don't wanna go into a biker bar</a>
02:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h02m04s">because you might find yourself in a situation where panicked defensive aggression is immediately necessary</a>
02:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h02m10s">you probably don't want that; you don't want the panic, you don't want the terror</a>
02:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h02m14s">you don't want the frenzied fight, you don't want any of that, you don't wanna have to run away in absolute panic</a>
02:02:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h02m19s">so you just don't go there</a>
02:02:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h02m21s">and a huge part of how we regulate our emotions</a>
02:02:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h02m25s">is just by never going anywhere where we have to experience them</a>
02:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h02m29s">and so that has very little to do with internal inhibitory control, and everything to do with staying where you belong</a>
02:02:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h02m35s">so... okay</a>
02:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h02m38s">so, basic motivations: hunger, thirst, pain</a>
02:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h02m41s">pain is not regulated by the hypothalamus, that's a different circuit</a>
02:02:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h02m45s">anger / aggression, thermoregulation</a>
02:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h02m48s">panic and escape</a>
02:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h02m50s">affiliation and care, sexual desire, exploration, play</a>
02:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h02m53s">and you can kinda break those into</a>
02:02:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h02m58s">the classic darwinian categories, too, and say, well, there's a set of motivations that go along with self-maintenance</a>
02:02:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h03m04s">that's be your survival, ingestive and defensive</a>
02:03:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h03m08s">see, I've sort of coded them there</a>
02:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h03m11s">so the self maintenance</a>
02:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h03m15s">there's an ingestive set of basic motivations that go with self maintenance, that's hunger, thirst</a>
02:03:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h03m20s">there's a set of defensive motivations: pain, anger, thermoregulation, panic and escape</a>
02:03:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h03m26s">and then there's motivations that are associated with reproduction</a>
02:03:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h03m30s">affiliation, care, and sexual desire</a>
02:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h03m33s">and then I put exploration and play sort of outside of that</a>
02:03:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h03m37s">I would say because those two things serve both of these approximately equally</a>
02:03:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h03m43s">so what I tried to do is take the basic motivations, and then nest them inside a fundamental darwinian framework</a>
02:03:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h03m49s">so that you can see how the biological process of evolution has manifested itself, an then sort of differentiated into these fundamental biological systems</a>
02:03:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h04m00s">okay, so this is a rat brain flat map</a>
02:04:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h04m04s">so it's basically what you would see of a rat's brain if you flattened it out, unrolled it, flattened it out, and then made it two-dimesional</a>
02:04:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h04m12s">and you can see here...</a>
02:04:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h04m14s">so this is the hypothalamus</a>
02:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h04m18s">and you can see that it's made out of these different nuclei, that's what they're called</a>
02:04:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h04m22s">and they sort of correspond to those shapes that I showed you in the human hypothalamus earlier</a>
02:04:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h04m26s">and you see that there's different systems, there's the system for eating and drinking, it's outlined in green</a>
02:04:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h04m31s">and the reproductive system, there's two of them, and they're outlined in I think it's red... is that right?</a>
02:04:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h04m39s">yeah, reproductive is red, and the defensive ones are in magenta</a>
02:04:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h04m44s">and so those are the... you could think about those as the three fundamental value systems</a>
02:04:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h04m49s">of living creatures with complex nervous systems as far as the hypothalamus is concerned</a>
02:04:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h04m54s">and then, given what I told you about the hypothalamus, which is...</a>
02:04:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h04m59s">you hardly need the rest of your brain at all, as long as you have a hypothalamus</a>
02:04:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h05m04s">it's worth thinking that those are very fundamental to value per se</a>
02:05:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h05m08s">now, you might think, if you only need the damn hypothalamus, why bother with the rest of the brain at all?</a>
02:05:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h05m14s">which is a very useful question</a>
02:05:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h05m17s">especially because most creatures don't have much of a brain, so...</a>
02:05:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h05m21s">but it seems to be something like:</a>
02:05:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h05m23s">well, you've got your eating and drinking system, your reproductive system, and your defensive system, but</a>
02:05:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h05m28s">the problem is that those things, first of all, can conflict,</a>
02:05:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h05m32s">you know, are you too hungry to sleep or too sleepy to eat?</a>
02:05:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h05m36s">that's a pretty simple kind of contradiction</a>
02:05:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h05m39s">are you more angry at your partner or do you want sexual relations more?</a>
02:05:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h05m43s">so they can conflict in the present</a>
02:05:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h05m46s">but then they can conflict with other people doing the same thing</a>
02:05:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h05m50s">and they can conflict across time</a>
02:05:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h05m52s">and so partly the reason that you need the rest of your brain is to solve the problems from the solutions that the hypothalamus offers</a>
02:05:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h06m00s">and so, because you don't wanna just eat and drink, and reproduce and defend yourself</a>
02:06:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h06m06s">you wanna eat now, later, tomorrow, next week, and next month</a>
02:06:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h06m11s">while you're able to engage in reproductive activity and defend yourself</a>
02:06:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h06m16s">in multiple contexts, with a whole bunch of people, for as long as you can possibly manage it</a>
02:06:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h06m20s">and so you need the rest of your brain to calculate that</a>
02:06:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h06m23s">and so what the rest of your brain has to do, roughly speaking, is regulate these</a>
02:06:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h06m29s">and also elaborate them up into... into something that's integrated inside you</a>
02:06:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h06m35s">which might roughly be your personality, and then</a>
02:06:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h06m37s">so that that personality is integrated with the personality of other people</a>
02:06:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h06m41s">and so you can think about it as an emergent process</a>
02:06:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h06m43s">this is one of the things I really like about Piaget</a>
02:06:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h06m46s">he's so damn smart, because Piaget is the only thinker I know, really</a>
02:06:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h06m51s">who really addressed the problem of the evolution of value systems</a>
02:06:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h06m55s">like, he never nailed it down to the physiology, because there wasn't enough known about physiology when he did his work</a>
02:06:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h07m01s">but it maps really nicely onto the physiology</a>
02:07:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h07m03s">...</a>
02:07:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h07m06s">but he got it right anyways, he said: you come into the world with a handful of preestablished reflexes</a>
02:07:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h07m13s">okay, we're gonna complicate that up a bit: no, you come into the world with a handful of micropersonalities</a>
02:07:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h07m19s">that are centered around these fundamental motivational axes, okay</a>
02:07:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h07m24s">and then that gets you started</a>
02:07:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h07m26s">and that has motor output as well as perceptions, and all of that, that's associated with it</a>
02:07:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h07m31s">and then, as you interact initially, let's say, with your mother</a>
02:07:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h07m35s">you start to learn how to integrate those things in some sort of social context</a>
02:07:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h07m39s">because you form a relationship with your mother right off the bat</a>
02:07:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h07m43s">and so, you're starting to figure out how to produce patterned and stable interactions between those motivational systems</a>
02:07:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h07m52s">on a day to day, week to week, month to month basis</a>
02:07:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h07m55s">and one of the things you do with kids, it's really important to do this with kids</a>
02:07:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h07m58s">you wanna get them on to some sort of a routine</a>
02:07:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h08m02s">'cause what the routine is actually, is the beginnings of the system that integrates</a>
02:08:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h08m06s">all of these underlying biological systems into some sort of unity</a>
02:08:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h08m10s">'cause they have to sleep and wake up, so you wanna get that nailed down, so it's predictable</a>
02:08:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h08m16s">you know, they have to eat, they have to stay warm</a>
02:08:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h08m19s">and they need to do that in a manner that's stable</a>
02:08:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h08m23s">and so, it's to your great benefit as a parent that you get islands of stability planted in the life of your kid</a>
02:08:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h08m32s">so that some of this gets simplified, so that the kid isn't constantly preoccupied with domination by these different motivational systems</a>
02:08:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h08m39s">and so it's a useful thing to know, because you might think, well, you don't wanna impose any structure on your baby, it's like, no, wrong</a>
02:08:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h08m46s">you don't wanna be a tyrant about it, but</a>
02:08:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h08m49s">there's no difference between that structure, and the emergence of the child's adaptation to the world</a>
02:08:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h08m55s">and to some degree what you're trying to do is free them up from arbitrary domination by these underlying motivational systems</a>
02:08:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h09m02s">you know, 'cause if the baby gets too tired, it's a horrible little thing, it'll just scream at you non stop</a>
02:09:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h09m08s">and it's not happy about it, it's like it's not good for anyone for that to happen</a>
02:09:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h09m13s">and so the faster... you have to do it in relationship with the child</a>
02:09:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h09m16s">some will sleep right away in a schedule almost immediately</a>
02:09:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h09m20s">and other kids are harder to get their circadian rhythms regulated</a>
02:09:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h09m26s">so you have to attend to the individual differences that characterize the child, but</a>
02:09:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h09m30s">you're still trying to establish some stable harmony out of this mish-mash of initial systems</a>
02:09:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h09m41s">alright, so that's sort of a physiological look, and this is a more of a conceptual look at it</a>
02:09:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h09m48s">I said that each of these systems you can think about in a bunch of different ways</a>
02:09:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h09m52s">you can think about it as something that sets a goal</a>
02:09:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h09m56s">"I'm hungry, and I don't wanna be hungry - point A, point B</a>
02:09:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h10m01s">so the hunger and the vision of the satiation of the hunger are all part of the same frame</a>
02:10:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h10m07s">and so, if you're hungry, you go into the kitchen</a>
02:10:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h10m10s">you know that already, that's part of your procedural knowledge about how the world works</a>
02:10:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h10m17s">and then what you're gonna look for are only those things that are relevant to what you're trying to do in the kitchen</a>
02:10:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h10m23s">everything else is zeroed out, you won't even really see it, and why would you?</a>
02:10:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h10m27s">you want to see the things that are relevant to the task at hand</a>
02:10:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h10m31s">and so that's the thing that's so cool, I think</a>
02:10:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h10m34s">because what it means is that you see the things that are relevant to the task at hand</a>
02:10:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h10m38s">and so, here's something to think about</a>
02:10:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h10m40s">let's say that you see a whole bunch of things that you don't wanna see</a>
02:10:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h10m44s">that make you constantly miserable and unhappy</a>
02:10:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h10m47s">one thing that you might ask yourself is: are you sure that your goals are proper?</a>
02:10:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h10m53s">because your goals determine what you see; now, not a 100 percent, obviously</a>
02:10:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h10m57s">you could be thinking about the homework you're gonna do and step off a curb and be hit by a van, it's like</a>
02:10:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h11m03s">you're gonna get hit by the van regardless of how you've oriented your perceptions, in all likelihood</a>
02:11:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h11m09s">so I'm not trying to argue for pure solipsism</a>
02:11:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h11m11s">but it is very interesting to consider that since you see in relationship to what you want</a>
02:11:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h11m18s">that a very large amount of what you see is dependent on what you're aiming at</a>
02:11:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h11m22s">and so one issue is: if your life is wretched and miserable</a>
02:11:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h11m26s">one thing to think about is whether or not what you're aiming at is the right thing to be aiming at</a>
02:11:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h11m30s">and "nothing" is exactly the wrong answer to that</a>
02:11:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h11m34s">"I'm aiming at nothing" Okay, you're gonna experience a tremendous amount of misery and not very much joy</a>
02:11:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h11m40s">so anyways, you've got this little frame:</a>
02:11:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h11m43s">you're somewhere, and it's not good enough, and you're going somewhere else, that's going to be better</a>
02:11:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h11m48s">and what "better" depends upon is the state of these underlying biological systems</a>
02:11:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h11m55s">and then, more complexly, as those biological systems get integrated into a personality, and into the social world</a>
02:11:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h12m01s">then the frame and the goal is going to be dependent on that more complex hierarchical organization</a>
02:12:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h12m08s">so, you're not in here 'cause you're hungry</a>
02:12:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h12m10s">you're in here, because if you get a degree, maybe you don't ever have to be hungry</a>
02:12:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h12m15s">so the hunger is properly incorporated into your...</a>
02:12:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h12m20s">you don't wanna be cold, you don't wanna freeze to death in the winter, you don't wanna be on the street</a>
02:12:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h12m23s">you know, so your higher-order goals are</a>
02:12:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h12m26s">long-term socially negotiated solutions</a>
02:12:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h12m30s">to the problems that are implicit in your being, that might be one way of thinkig about it</a>
02:12:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h12m37s">and the microelements of this... so you could say "I'm hungry", that's a physiological state and a conception</a>
02:12:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h12m44s">"I have a vision about how I'm going to solve that"</a>
02:12:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h12m47s">but then... and that's an abstraction</a>
02:12:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h12m51s">but what you do to transform point A into point B is not an abstraction, you act</a>
02:12:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h12m56s">you know, so if you're hungry, you actually move your body, say down from the second floor into the kitchen</a>
02:12:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h13m02s">and you arrange things so that there's transformations in the world</a>
02:13:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h13m07s">that's a good way of thinking about the relationship between the mind and the body</a>
02:13:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h13m11s">your hypothetical solution to your problem, that's the mind</a>
02:13:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h13m15s">but the manner in which you incarnate that solution</a>
02:13:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h13m18s">that's no longer abstract</a>
02:13:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h13m21s">you know, people are always trying to solve the mind-body problem</a>
02:13:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h13m24s">and as far as I can tell, that's how you solve it, is: you have abstractions, but they're not abstractions that are representations of the world</a>
02:13:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h13m31s">they're abstractions that are representations of action patterns</a>
02:13:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h13m36s">and the way those are implemented in the world is that you act them</a>
02:13:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h13m40s">and so, it's strange, 'cause you've got this weird level of control</a>
02:13:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h13m44s">I can move my arm, and I seem to be able to do that voluntarily</a>
02:13:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h13m47s">but Ireally have no idea how I'm doing it</a>
02:13:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h13m49s">like I don't have conscious access exactly to the musculature, except technically</a>
02:13:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h13m55s">and I certainly have no idea what I'm doing chemically to make those muscles transform</a>
02:13:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h14m01s">so my abstractions ground out in this movement</a>
02:14:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h14m07s">and I can observe the movement, and modify it, but</a>
02:14:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h14m12s">I have no conscious access whatsoever to the micro processes that are making tha possible</a>
02:14:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h14m17s">I've no idea why that is, probably because I'm not smart enough</a>
02:14:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h14m21s">that would be my guess</a>
02:14:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h14m23s">evolution is only going to allow your mind to control those elements of your being</a>
02:14:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h14m29s">that you're smart enough to control</a>
02:14:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h14m31s">and so you don't get voluntary control over your heartbeat, for example, because you'd just forget</a>
02:14:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h14m35s">and then you'd be wandering around, and then you'd forget to beat your heart, bang, you'd be dead, so you don't get to do that</a>
02:14:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h14m42s">...</a>
02:14:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h14m46s">all these different</a>
02:14:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h14m48s">I classify these, again, as self-propagation  and self-maintenance motivations</a>
02:14:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h14m54s">if you're too hot, well, you wanna go somewhere cooler, and if you're too cool you wanna go somewhere hotter</a>
02:14:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h14m58s">same if you're thirsty and hungry</a>
02:14:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h15m00s">and for self-propagation, well, you get lonesome and maybe you have some sexual desire</a>
02:15:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h15m05s">and each of those different systems competes for access to this central frame</a>
02:15:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h15m11s">and that's something like the contents of your consciousness at any given time</a>
02:15:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h15m15s">so up pops a desire... but it's a wrong way of thinking about it</a>
02:15:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h15m20s">'cause a desire sounds like something that's pushing you forward</a>
02:15:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h15m23s">but the desire is goal, framework, emotion, perception, action pattern, all at the same time</a>
02:15:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h15m29s">it's a little personality, or it's a little story</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h15m32s">actually, when you describe the operation of one of these things, that's when you're teling a story</a>
02:15:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h15m37s">so I was somewhere, I needed something, I went and got it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h16m49s">the first thing a frame does for you is make almost everything irrelevant</a>
02:16:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h16m53s">and that's so great, because that's what you want</a>
02:16:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h16m55s">you want almost everything to be irrelevant, because otherwise you're gonna be so flooded with information, that you...</a>
02:16:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h17m01s">that's what hallucinogens do, at least in their initial stages</a>
02:17:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h17m05s">is they take away that filter, and make everything relevant</a>
02:17:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h17m09s">you can read about that in Huxley's "Doors of Perception"</a>
02:17:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h17m13s">he does a great job of describing the initial stages of a mescaline experience</a>
02:17:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h17m17s">and what happens is that all of the memory, in some sense, that regulates his perceptions is stripped off</a>
02:17:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h17m23s">and so he sees everything glowing, and alive, and magical like he'd never encountered it before</a>
02:17:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h17m29s">which is exactly how you would see something if all your memory about it was  gone</a>
02:17:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h17m33s">and so he sees things as way more complex and interesting than he normally sees them</a>
02:17:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h17m38s">well, that's fine, but, you know, if you're like that all the time, then, you know, you end up in a ditch, starving to death or something</a>
02:17:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h17m43s">it's not commensurate with normal life, that's what it looks like</a>
02:17:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h17m47s">and so your perceptions are just shrunken, restricted to the bare minimum necessary to keep you moving in the direction that you're moving</a>
02:17:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h17m54s">alright, so the first thing you wanna do is you wanna make things irrelevant</a>
02:17:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h17m59s">now, if you're with someone</a>
02:17:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h18m02s">in a relationship</a>
02:18:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h18m04s">partly what you want them to do is to help you continue making most of their possibility irrelevant</a>
02:18:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h18m11s">it's polite</a>
02:18:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h18m13s">so you say, well, "we have a friendship", let's say</a>
02:18:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h18m18s">so that means you've agreed to act in a friendly manner towards me, and to support me</a>
02:18:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h18m23s">there's all sorts of other ways you could act</a>
02:18:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h18m25s">like a myriad of them</a>
02:18:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h18m27s">and I' gonna do the same for you, so we're simpler to each other than we would normally be</a>
02:18:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h18m32s">and then you go and so something that betrays me, it's like bang, that whole simplification is gone</a>
02:18:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h18m37s">and all those parts of you that were supposed to be irrelevant, 'cause we were playing the same game</a>
02:18:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h18m42s">they're dead relevant, and I don't know who the hell you are</a>
02:18:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h18m45s">and so that's really rough, and people do not like that</a>
02:18:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h18m48s">it's this emergent mismatch between their desires and the way the world is manifesting itself</a>
02:18:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h18m53s">so one of the issues of complexity is that</a>
02:18:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h18m57s">when you hit an obstacle, everything that you have agreed with other people to make irrelevant - is relevant</a>
02:18:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h19m05s">and that's generally a disconcerting experience</a>
02:19:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h19m09s">now you can, you know, you might wanna toy a little bit with that in a relationship</a>
02:19:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h19m15s">maybe you encourage your partner to dress differently or you go do different things or something</a>
02:19:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h19m19s">'cause you don't wanna be stuck in exactly the same old rut</a>
02:19:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h19m22s">and so what you'll agree is how you can both deviate an interesting amount</a>
02:19:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h19m27s">but that's voluntary and controlled, it's not the same at all as having that little mess of eighty million snakes pop up right in front of you</a>
02:19:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h19m35s">which is the last thing you wanna have happen, and so</a>
02:19:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h19m39s">it's so weird, because one of the things that we're striving to do constatnly is to keep most of the world irrelevant</a>
02:19:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h19m45s">and our cultural systems are designed precisely for that purpose, and par of what you do when you disrupt them is</a>
02:19:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h19m53s">you force people to consider a far more range of relevance than they are even vaguely comfortable or vaguely comfortable to manage</a>
02:19:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h20m01s">and it just burns them to a crisp</a>
02:20:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h20m03s">because what your body does is:</a>
02:20:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h20m05s">if all of a sudden everything around you is relevant...</a>
02:20:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h20m08s">like I could say: "you're stripped naked, I take you in a helicopter, drop you right into the middle of the jungle at midnight"</a>
02:20:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h20m14s">it's like, you're not bored</a>
02:20:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h20m17s">standing there, frozen, paralyzed, everything is interesting</a>
02:20:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h20m22s">well, too bad for you, 'cause too interesting is very little different from terrifying, and so</a>
02:20:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h20m29s">you know, your heart rate's gonna be at 160 for like two days, and then something will eat you, and your problems will be over</a>
02:20:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h20m35s">alright, so this diagram basically suggests this</a>
02:20:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h20m39s">is this is how you break up the world when you're going from point A to point B</a>
02:20:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h20m42s">it renders almost everything irelevant, hooray</a>
02:20:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h20m47s">and then what happens is the rest of the world is broken up into obstacles that get in your way</a>
02:20:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h20m52s">and tools that facilitate your movement forward</a>
02:20:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h20m55s">and that's actually what you see when you come into a place</a>
02:20:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h20m58s">like when you come into this room, these are obstacles insofar as you con't walk through them</a>
02:20:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h21m03s">and those are tools insofar as you can sit on them and watch the class</a>
02:21:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h21m07s">and this is a tool, and these are tools, and this is a tool</a>
02:21:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h21m12s">and I'm a tool, although I'd never admit it</a>
02:21:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h21m14s">but anyways, I'm a tool, because you need to take this class in order to advance towards your degree</a>
02:21:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h21m23s">and so, basically what you see inthe world are entities of functional significance</a>
02:21:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h21m28s">and those are not objects, they're not the same thing</a>
02:21:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h21m31s">and that's very much worth considering, because we're trying to</a>
02:21:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h21m35s">build up a case, at least in part, for analyzing the nature of the structure within which you organize your perceptions</a>
02:21:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h21m43s">and we tend to think that those are predicated on object perception</a>
02:21:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h21m47s">it's not true</a>
02:21:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h21m49s">, they're predicated on relevance conception</a>
02:21:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h21m53s">does it help you? does it get in your way? or is it irrelevant?</a>
02:21:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h21m58s">that's what you wanna know; if it helps you, you're happy about it; if it gets in your way, you're negatively predisposed towards it; if it's irrelevant, it's invisible</a>
02:21:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h22m07s">and so, if your little scheme is functional, your little frame is functional</a>
02:22:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h22m13s">then most of the things that you encounter are mildly positive</a>
02:22:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h22m16s">and that's how you know that you know what you're doing, that's how you validate the entire frame</a>
02:22:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudKmwzDpNY#t=02h22m20s">so okay, good</a>
