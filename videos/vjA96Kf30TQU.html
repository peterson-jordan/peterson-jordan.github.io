00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h00m05s">it reminded me of something you said, I think it was Joe Rogan,</a>
00:00:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h00m09s">talking about SJWs and how they create their own chaos</a>
00:00:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h00m14s">talking about how adolescents have this drive to change the world.</a>
00:00:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h00m17s">And I was wondering if those three, the criminality, creativity and drive to change the world, are linked,</a>
00:00:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h00m24s">and if so, if they manifest differently in men than in women,</a>
00:00:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h00m29s">and if they kind of come from the same area.</a>
00:00:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h00m30s">- Well, I think they are linked. But I'm going to concentrate more on the second part of your question.</a>
00:00:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h00m35s">So, I'm going to ask you guys to think about something.</a>
00:00:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h00m39s">I talked to a friend of mine the other day. He's a very, very smart guy.</a>
00:00:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h00m41s">And we'd been talking about, well, all the sorts of things that we've been talking about tonight, for a long time.</a>
00:00:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h00m46s">We were talking about the relative evolutionary roles of men and women.</a>
00:00:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h00m52s">This is speculative, obviously.</a>
00:00:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h00m55s">Because our research did indicate -- it's tentative research so far</a>
00:00:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h00m58s">that the SJW sort of 'equality above all else' philosophy is more prevalent among women.</a>
00:00:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h01m08s">It's predicted by the personality factors that are more common among women.</a>
00:01:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h01m12s">So, agreeableness and high negative emotion.</a>
00:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h01m15s">Primarily agreeableness.</a>
00:01:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h01m17s">But in addition, it's also predicted by being female.</a>
00:01:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h01m20s">And that's interesting, because in most of the personality research that I've done,</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h01m23s">and as far as I know in the literature, at... you know, more broadly speaking,</a>
00:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h01m29s">most of the time you can get rid of the attitudinal differences between men and women,</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h01m33s">or at least reduce them, by controlling for personality.</a>
00:01:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h01m35s">So, if you take a feminine man, and a masculine woman,</a>
00:01:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h01m38s">then, you know, the poles reverse. That didn't seem to be the case with political correctness.</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h01m45s">And so I've been thinking about that a lot.</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h01m47s">Because, well, men are bailing out of the humanities like mad.</a>
00:01:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h01m50s">And pretty much out of the universities. Except for STEM.</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h01m53s">The women are moving in like mad. And they're also moving into the political sphere like mad.</a>
00:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h01m58s">And this is new, right. We've never had this happen before.</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h02m00s">And we do not know what the significance of it is.</a>
00:02:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h02m03s">It's only 50 years old.</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h02m05s">And so, we were thinking about this, and so... I don't know what you think about this proposition, but</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h02m10s">imagine that, historically speaking, it's something like</a>
00:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h02m15s">women were responsible for distribution and men were responsible for production.</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h02m20s">Something like that. And maybe that's only the case, really,</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h02m23s">in the tight confines of the immediate family.</a>
00:02:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h02m26s">But that doesn't matter, because that's most of the evolutionary landscape for human beings, anyways.</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h02m30s">But what the women did was make sure that everybody got enough.</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h02m34s">Okay, and that seems to me to be one of the things that's driving,</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h02m38s">at least in part, the SJW demand for equity and equality.</a>
00:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h02m42s">It's like, let's make sure everybody has enough.</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h02m44s">It's like, well, fair enough, you know. I mean, you can't argue with that.</a>
00:02:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h02m48s">But there's an antipathy between that and the reality of differential productivity.</a>
00:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h02m55s">You know, because people really do differ in their productivity.</a>
00:02:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h02m58s">So, alright. So, to answer your question fully,</a>
00:02:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h03m02s">I do think that the rebellious tendency of adolescence is associated</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h03m06s">both with that criminality spike, especially among men, and with creativity. Yes.</a>
00:03:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h03m11s">I think that the SJW phenomenon is different.</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h03m14s">And I think it is associated, at least in part, with the rise of women to political power.</a>
00:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h03m18s">And we don't know what women are like when they have political power</a>
00:03:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h03m23s">because they're never had it. I mean, there's been queens, obviously</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h03m27s">and that sort of thing. There's been female authority figures, and females</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h03m29s">have wielded far more power historically than feminists generally like to admit.</a>
00:03:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h03m33s">But this is a different thing. We don't know what a truly female political philosophy would be like.</a>
00:03:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h03m39s">But it might be, especially if it's not been well examined, and it isn't very sophisticated conceptually,</a>
00:03:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h03m45s">it could easily be, 'well, let's make sure things are distributed equally.'</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h03m48s">Well, yeah. But sorry, that's just not going to fly.</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h03m52s">- Do you think in terms of the West and the SJWs, that you talked about in the last lecture as well,</a>
00:03:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h03m57s">creating chaos when there is none, otherwise it would be static, do you think there would be</a>
00:03:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h04m01s">any validity in saying that in a country like Canada, where we're pretty gender equal,</a>
00:04:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h04m06s">is there any merit to thinking SJWs are trying to create chaos even when there arguably is none</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h04m13s">on a mass level obviously, if there are still problems...</a>
00:04:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h04m15s">- Why do they do that?</a>
00:04:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h04m17s">- Otherwise it would be static.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h04m19s">- Well, so I read this quote once, and I don't remember who said it.</a>
00:04:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h04m27s">It might have been Robert Heinlein, for crying out loud. A science fiction author.</a>
00:04:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h04m31s">That springs to mind, but it probably wasn't.</a>
00:04:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h04m33s">And the proposition was that men tested ideas, and that women tested men.</a>
00:04:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h04m38s">And I kinda like that. There's something about that, you know?</a>
00:04:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h04m42s">And now, it obviously is an over-generalization, but</a>
00:04:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h04m44s">we also don't know to what degree women test men sheerly through provocation.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h04m50s">It's a lot! Because, like, if you were to test someone,</a>
00:04:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h04m53s">you don't have a little conversation with them, like, you poke the hell out of them</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h04m56s">and you say, okay, I'm going to go after you, and see where your weak spots are.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h05m01s">And it seems to me that in this constant protest and use of shame</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h05m07s">and all of that that goes along with this sort of radical movement towards egalitarianism,</a>

00:05:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h05m31s">That at the same time, there's this massive political demand for, like, radical equality.</a>
00:05:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h05m38s">And... say... with regards to sexual behaviour.</a>
00:05:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h05m41s">And the fastest selling novel the world had ever seen was S&amp;M domination, right.</a>
00:05:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h05m47s">It's like, oh, well, we know where the unconscious is going with that one, don't we?</a>
00:05:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h05m52s">And sometimes I think, like... because one of the things that I've really tried to puzzle out</a>
00:05:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h05m57s">it's not like I believe this, right, I'm just telling you where the edges of my thinking have been going:</a>
00:05:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h06m02s">is that you have this crazy alliance between the feminists and the radical Islamists that I just do not get.</a>
00:06:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h06m08s">It's like, the feminists, why they aren't protesting non-stop about Saudi Arabia, is just completely beyond me!</a>
00:06:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h06m15s">Like, I do not understand it in the least.</a>
00:06:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h06m18s">And I wonder too, I just wonder bloody well -- and this is the Freudian in me --</a>
00:06:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h06m22s">is that, is there an attraction, you know, is there an attraction that's emerging among the female radicals</a>
00:06:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h06m28s">for that totalitarian male dominance that they've chased out of the West?</a>
00:06:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h06m33s">And I mean, that's a hell of a thing to think. But after all, I am psychoanalytically minded.</a>
00:06:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h06m38s">And I do think things like that. Because, like, I just can see no rational reason for it.</a>
00:06:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h06m43s">Like, the only other rational reason is that, well, the West needs to fall.</a>
00:06:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h06m49s">And so the enemy of my enemy is... exactly... no, what is it...</a>
00:06:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h06m54s">- The enemy of my enemy is my friend. That's why Islamists tend to vote liberal as well.</a>
00:06:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h06m59s">- Yes, exactly. Well, so, that could be the case.</a>
00:06:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h07m02s">But I'm not going to shake my suspicion about this unconscious balancing.</a>
00:07:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h07m07s">Because as the demand for egalitarianism and the eradication of masculinity accelerates,</a>
00:07:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h07m14s">there's going to be a longing in the unconscious for the precise opposite of that, right.</a>
00:07:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h07m20s">The more you scream for equality, the more your unconscious is going to admire dominance.</a>
00:07:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h07m27s">And so, well, that's... that's how you think if you're psychoanalytically minded.</a>
00:07:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h07m33s">And you know, I'm a great admirer of Freud. He knew a hell of a lot more than people like to think.</a>
00:07:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h07m37s">And so that's partly why everyone still hates him,</a>
00:07:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h07m40s">even though it's been 100 years since he's, you know, really been around.</a>
00:07:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA96Kf30TQU#t=00h07m44s">Alright, we should stop.</a>
