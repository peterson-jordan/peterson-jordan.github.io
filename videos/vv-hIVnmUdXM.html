					<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h00m15s">I've really been trying to understand the underlying psychology of postmodernism and its relationship with neo-Marxism,</a>
00:00:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h00m23s">and then the spread of that into the universities and the effect on the culture.</a>
00:00:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h00m28s">And what I would like to start with is a description of your understanding of that,</a>
00:00:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h00m32s">because I've presented to the people who are listening to me my understanding of it.</a>
00:00:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h00m36s">But I interviewed Stephen Hicks recently, and he wrote an interesting book called "Explaining Postmodernism," which I liked quite a bit.</a>
00:00:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h00m43s">It's been criticized for being too right-wing, although I don't think he's right-wing at all.</a>
00:00:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h00m47s">I think maybe you could characterize him as middle-of-the-road conservative, but I would say he's more like a classic liberal.</a>
00:00:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h00m54s">But I'm really curious about your views about, well, what— what Postmodernism is first of all.</a>
00:00:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h01m02s">I know you've— you've identified it with the— with the general tricksters Derrida and Lacan and Foucault.</a>
00:01:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h01m08s">And Foucault in particular you've talked about.</a>
00:01:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h01m10s">But I'd like to know what you think about postmodernism and also why you think it's been so attractive to people.</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h01m17s">Well, my explanation is that there is no authentic 1960s point of view in any of the elite universities,</a>
00:01:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h01m25s">but rather the most liberated minds of my generation of 1960 did not go on to graduate school.</a>
00:01:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h01m32s">I witnessed this with my own eyes.</a>
00:01:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h01m34s">I saw genuine Marxists, okay, at my college, which was the State University of New York at Binghamton, upstate New York, Harpur College,</a>
00:01:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h01m42s">which had a huge cohort of very radical downstate New York Jews, okay, who—</a>
00:01:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h01m48s">In fact, Harpur used to be called Berkeley East.</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h01m52s">I saw genuine passionate Marxists with my own eyes.</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h01m55s">They were not word choppers.</a>
00:01:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h01m58s">They were not snide postmodernists, right?</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h02m01s">They were in-your-face aggressive.</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h02m04s">They used the language of the people.</a>
00:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h02m06s">They had a populist and energy, okay?</a>
00:02:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h02m09s">They dressed working class. They were nonmaterialistic, okay?</a>
00:02:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h02m12s">These are people who lived by their own convictions.</a>
00:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h02m14s">They were against the graduate schools, all right?</a>
00:02:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h02m17s">When I— When I, uh, went on to graduate school, and it became known that I was going to go to Yale,</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h02m23s">I was confronted by a leader of the radicals on campus, in broad daylight in front of everyone,</a>
00:02:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h02m29s">who denounced me for— he said,</a>
00:02:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h02m32s">"Grad school is not where it's happening. You don't— You don't do that.</a>
00:02:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h02m35s">If you have to go to graduate school you should go to Buffalo."</a>
00:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h02m38s">Now, I had applied to SUNY Buffalo, because the great leftist critic Leslie Fiedler was there, who had a huge impact on me.</a>
00:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h02m45s">He's practically created identity politics, but without its present distortions, all right?</a>
00:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h02m50s">And Norman Holland, the psychoanalytic critic was there.</a>
00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h02m53s">I would have been very happy to have gone on to Buffalo, but I needed the library at Yale, so I continued on to Yale.</a>
00:02:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h02m57s">There were no radicals in the graduate schools, okay, from 1968 to '72, when i was there.</a>
00:02:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h03m05s">Only one radical, Todd Gitlin, who went on to have a career success, okay?</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h03m10s">The actual radicals of the 1960s, okay, either went off— dropped out of college, or went off to create communes, right,</a>
00:03:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h03m17s">or they were taking acid and destroyed their brains.</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h03m20s">Now, I have also written about that,</a>
00:03:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h03m22s">the destruction of the minds, okay, of the most talented members of my generation through LSD.</a>
00:03:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h03m29s">It was going on all around me, right?</a>
00:03:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h03m31s">So, what's happened is the actual legacy of the '60s got truncated.</a>
00:03:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h03m35s">The idea that these post-structuralists and postmodernists are heirs of the 1960s revolution is an absolute crock, okay?</a>
00:03:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h03m44s">What they represent, as Foucault shows—</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h03m46s">Foucault said, okay, that the biggest influence on his thinking, okay, was Samuel Beckett's "Waiting for Godot," okay,</a>
00:03:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h03m53s">which was a post-World-War-II play, written in Paris,</a>
00:03:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h03m58s">that was about the disillusionment and nihilism experienced after Hitler went through, occupied France, right, and all of Europe was in ruins.</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h04m06s">It had nothing to do with what—</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h04m09s">"Waiting for Godot" has nothing to do with the authentic legacy of the 1960s,</a>
00:04:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h04m13s">which was about genuine multiculturalism, a movement toward India, toward Hinduism,</a>
00:04:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h04m18s">a transformation of consciousness through psychedelics, which I did not take, but which I identify with totally through the music, etc., all right?</a>
00:04:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h04m26s">It was a turn toward the body.</a>
00:04:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h04m28s">It was a turn towards sensory experience, okay?</a>
00:04:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h04m31s">Not this "word-chopping" thing, and this, like, cynical removal from actual experience, all right?</a>
00:04:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h04m37s">That French import, okay, came in, okay, to the graduate schools.</a>
00:04:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h04m41s">It did not affect any genuine 1960s person.</a>
00:04:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h04m44s">The real 1960s revolution was about Jung.</a>
00:04:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h04m47s">It was about a way of seeing the cosmos in mythological terms, all right?</a>
00:04:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h04m52s">And the Jungian contribution went on into the New Age movement of the 1970s, aside from the universities, all right?</a>
00:04:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h05m00s">So, who took over the universities were these careerists, okay?</a>
00:05:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h05m04s">I saw them with my own eyes. I saw what happened. I saw—</a>
00:05:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h05m08s">I was at Yale when Derrida was being shipped over, okay, to address the, uh, you know, the students— the grad students and the faculty.</a>
00:05:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h05m16s">And I said to a fellow student, after hearing one of these guys speak—</a>
00:05:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h05m20s">It wasn't Derrida. It was another one of the theorists.</a>
00:05:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h05m24s">I said, "They are like high priests murmuring to each other." All right?</a>
00:05:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h05m29s">This was an elitist form from the start, okay?</a>
00:05:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h05m33s">It was not progressive. It was not revolutionary. It was reactionary.</a>
00:05:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h05m38s">It was a desperate attempt to hold on to what had happened before the 1960s sensory revolution.</a>
00:05:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h05m44s">But this postmodernist thing, okay, this trashing, okay, of the text,</a>

00:05:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h06m04s">That is not the empathic, emotional, okay, sensory-based, okay, revolution of the 1960s, right?</a>
00:06:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h06m12s">I am sick and tired of these people claiming any kind of mantle from the 1960s. They're frauds.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h06m17s">These people are— What happened in the 1970s was a collapse of the job market in academia, okay?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h06m24s">All of a sudden, jobs were scarce, and this thing was there, the new and improved and shiny thing, okay, to be a theorist.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h06m32s">And people seized on it, okay? It was institutionalized, all right?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h06m35s">And it's an enormous betrayal of the 1960s.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h06m38s">Okay so that- You touched on this idea of "the destruction of the work of art".</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-hIVnmUdXM#t=00h06m43s">You know, and one of the things I really liked about reading Nietzsche was his discussion of "ressentiment" right?</a>
