00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h00m03s">Here's how you know if someone's your friend</a>
00:00:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h00m06s">a) You can tell them bad news and they'll listen they won't tell you why you know you're stupid and why that bad thing happened to you</a>
00:00:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h00m14s">and how something worse happened to them once and you know derail the whole conversation</a>
00:00:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h00m19s">You, can actually tell them bad news and they'll listen so that's a good thing and then this is a weirder thing</a>
00:00:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h00m25s">you can tell them good news</a>
00:00:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h00m27s">and they'll help you celebrate</a>
00:00:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h00m30s">and that's a really good way of deciding who you should have around you</a>
00:00:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h00m32s">because if you have someone around you you know something good happens to you you're kind of afraid to</a>
00:00:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h00m36s">even admit it because you know god something good happen to you it's like</a>
00:00:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h00m40s">that</a>
00:00:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h00m40s">You let  be known and they'll certainly be taken away</a>
00:00:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h00m43s">so you know you you come out and you sort of tell someone</a>
00:00:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h00m45s">half-heartedly that something good happened to you and then they give you a whack and then talk about</a>
00:00:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h00m49s">you know</a>
00:00:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h00m50s">Some of the great thing that happened to them three years ago or worse the great thing that happened to someone that they knew three years ago</a>
00:00:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h00m57s">You know it's like go away from that person, they're not helpful to you</a>
00:00:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h01m01s">and they're not helpful to themselves either</a>
00:01:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h01m03s">and so you want to surround yourself ...  you've got to think about this</a>
00:01:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h01m06s">You've got to surround yourself with people who want the best for the best part of you</a>
00:01:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h01m11s">you can hang around with weasels and losers that are trying to pull you down</a>
00:01:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h01m14s">To justify the fact that they're spiraling downhill as well</a>
00:01:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h01m17s">and you know the upside of that is you don't have to have any responsibility</a>
00:01:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h01m20s">you can all whine about how wretched life is you know so that's pretty attractive</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h01m24s">But I would say it's also a mid... bad medium to long term plan</a>
00:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h01m28s">and so it's it's acceptable and desirable</a>
00:01:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h01m32s">to try to surround yourself, with people who are facilitating your development</a>
00:01:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h01m37s">and you know you might say well i've got people around I know them well you know</a>
00:01:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h01m41s">they're they're not doing that well and and they're and they don't fit into that category it's like</a>
00:01:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h01m48s">what's your point?</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h01m50s">What are you going to do with them exactly</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h01m51s">if they'll if they'll listen and cooperate with you and move towards a better future</a>
00:01:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h01m56s">Great</a>
00:01:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h01m57s">If they don't pay any attention and they keep doing the same damn things over and over and they're not going anywhere and it's painful</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h02m03s">then maybe the proper thing to do is say "you just have your misery"</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h02m07s">I'll go off and have my life and maybe you'll wake up at some point in the future and think that's a better way of being</a>
00:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h02m13s">because just putting up with it is almost... well they call that enabling right</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h02m17s">you put up with that sort of behaviour</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h02m19s">you're providing tacit consent for it and even tacit approval it's like it's bad idea</a>
00:02:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h02m25s">you have</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h02m27s">I would say both the right and the responsibility</a>
00:02:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ukKf4vi6g#t=00h02m29s">To surround yourself with people who are good, for the best part of you</a>
