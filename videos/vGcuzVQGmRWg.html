<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h01m37s">And uh, you're good at interacting with the crowd.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h01m40s">You're charismatic, you watch the crowd,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h01m53s">which was like, no joke,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h01m57s">And then you were unemployed,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h01m59s">and that didn't work out, even though

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h02m02s">And then, maybe the economy fell apart,
completely, on you. Hyperinflation.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h02m07s">And then, maybe there was a Communist menace,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h02m15s">And, you're talking to people who aren't that happy either,</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h02m18s">cause they were also badly defeated in World War I,</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h02m20s">and then, they had a terrible treaty they had decided,

00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h02m24s">And so, the crowd's not happy and neither are you.
And there's reason for it.</a>
00:02:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h02m29s">And so, you start talking to them. You don't know,
what you're upset about - and neither does the crowd!</a>
00:02:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h02m34s">So, you start to articulate some things,
about why you might be upset.</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h02m37s">And, some of them fall flat.
But you're paying attention to the crowd.</a>
00:02:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h02m41s">So you stop saying those things.</a>
00:02:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h02m43s">And some of the things make the crowd really wake up and listen.</a>
00:02:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h02m47s">And so, you start saying more of those things, right?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h02m51s">It's an unconscious dialectic,
between you and the crowd.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h03m01s">It's more sophisticated than that. And so, you do that... 1000 times, and you do that to ever-increasing crowds.</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h03m08s">And the crowd REALLY starts to go mad.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h03m11s">And they basically tell you,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h03m50s">Now, you could be like Gandhi.
And you could've taken that into account beforehand.</a>
00:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h03m55s">Because he did.
He read Tolstoy, by the way.</a>
00:03:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h03m58s">He was a student of Tolstoy, and that's-
It's very interesting,</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h04m01s">because Tolstoy was the person who developed
the techniques of non-violence, that Gandhi used.</a>
00:04:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h04m06s">And Tolstoy was also a deeply religious writer,
[clears throat] apart from his novels.</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h04m11s">Um, which are not - I wouldn't say - really in the religious category, although they're profound.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h04m23s">He really stressed it, and that's what Gandhi took to heart.</a>
00:04:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h04m26s">So he lived a very, very, very, very

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h04m31s">And that was to kinda see, if he could keep his damn ego tamped down,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h04m38s">You know, and he dressed really simply,
and he didn't own much, and he ate very simply,</a>
00:04:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h04m41s">and, he just tried to stay away from the whole materialistic "success element" -</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h04m46s">- that would be an element of what would
turn him into an actor, and also inflate his ego.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h04m54s">Well, he led a non-violent revolution, that

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h05m00s">It also produced a terrible Civil War, in the separation
of the Muslim Indians from the Hindu Indians, and...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h05m06s">But... I don't think you can precisely
lay that at the feet of Gandhi, right?</a>
00:05:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h05m11s">But what I'm saying, is that you have to be an extraordinary person, you have to be extraordinarily wise,</a>
00:05:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h05m16s">and you have to take ridiculous precautions, if you're gonna put yourself in the public sphere like that,</a>
00:05:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h05m21s">and expose yourself to that kind of adulation,
without becoming a puppet of the crowd.</a>
00:05:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h05m26s">And that's what happened to Hitler</a>
00:05:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h05m28s">I mean, it's not like he wasn't also a conscious manipulator,</a>
00:05:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h05m31s">and surrounded himself by people who were propagandists, and all of that.</a>
00:05:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h05m35s">So there was a conscious element, but - you gotta think these things through, and see how that dialectic develops.</a>
00:05:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h05m41s">Like, he learned how to appeal to
the darkest fantasies of the crowd.</a>
00:05:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h05m45s">He was really, really good at it.</a>
00:05:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h05m48s">And that was a dialectic process, right?
The crowd told him, what they wanted to hear;</a>
00:05:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h05m52s">and the crowd's a mob at that point.</a>
00:05:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h05m55s">So: "I don't have to take responsibility
for the fact, that I'm screaming my approval,</a>
00:05:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h05m59s">when I'm surrounded by a million people".</a>
00:05:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h06m02s">So, I can scream my approval for whatever I want,</a>
00:06:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h06m04s">for whatever dark, revengeful fantasy
might be playing out in my imagination.</a>
00:06:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcuzVQGmRWg#t=00h06m09s">Because, I'm not gonna be held accountable for it.</a>
