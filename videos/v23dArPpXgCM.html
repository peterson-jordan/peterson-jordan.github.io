<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h24m10s">practically say not so much
metaphysically but practically and</a>
00:24:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h24m14s">realized that that was equivalent to the
discovery of time of the future because</a>
00:24:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h24m19s">we do we do act in it and this is a
peculiar discovery of human beings may</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h24m24s">be a consequence of our expanded
intelligences that we're actually aware</a>
00:24:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h24m27s">of the future and we actually treat the
future as if it's something that you can</a>
00:24:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h24m31s">bargain with now partly it's because the
future is other people and they remember</a>
00:24:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h24m35s">your reputation they remember your past
actions and if you do someone a favor</a>
00:24:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h24m39s">then that favor is in some sense stored
up in the future so you can think about</a>
00:24:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h24m44s">the future as a place of judgment about
your moral actions and it's not that far</a>
00:24:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h24m48s">from now to imagining a God who's
keeping track of that or who even is</a>
00:24:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h24m53s">that but in any case the idea of
sacrifice emerges in the story of Cain</a>
00:24:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h24m58s">and Abel and Cain and Abel both make
sacrifices to God in order to stay on</a>
00:24:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h25m04s">his good side let's say and what a
sacrifice means is that you give up</a>
00:25:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h25m08s">something of value in the present so
that you can be so that you can improve</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h25m12s">the future and you know that's no
different from what we call discipline</a>
00:25:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h25m16s">it's exactly the same thing
it's just that concretely acted out</a>
00:25:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h25m20s">version of that and so you know the idea
basically was that well God was in the</a>
00:25:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h25m27s">transcendent heavens and and the first
question would be well why is that and</a>
00:25:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h25m31s">it's like well if you go out in I'm
really dark night and look up at the sky</a>
00:25:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h25m35s">you have a sense of what's beyond you
what what's transcendent what's infinite</a>
00:25:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h25m40s">and and so to associate that with the
highest values is a reasonable</a>
00:25:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h25m45s">association right from from a say from
an emotional point of view so it's not</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h25m49s">particularly primitive it's a smart
metaphor or it's a smart intuition that</a>
00:25:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h25m56s">and it's above you and you know we tend
to think of when you're moving towards</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h26m08s">framework and that's partly because when
you go up like on a mountain you can see</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h26m12s">for long distances right so those all
those things</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h26m14s">tangle together so anyways so the idea
is that you have to give up something of</a>

there's kind of a hint in this story</a>
00:26:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h26m56s">that it's just a hint that came

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h27m01s">but in any case its ambivalent a but but
Abel he just does wonderfully well and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h27m07s">everything works out for him and

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h27m11s">and so God accepts his sacrifices but
for some reason he rejects Cain's and</a>
00:27:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=00h27m18s">maybe it's the arbitrariness of God or
maybe it's because Cain's heart isn't in</a>

that John Piaget pointed out and because</a>
01:27:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=01h27m55s">he was he's a very interesting

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=01h27m59s">taught properly because you know most of
these great thinkers were very strange</a>
01:27:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=01h28m04s">people and the strangeness gets added

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=01h28m08s">bad because they're way more interesting

01:28:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=01h28m11s">so Piaget was obsessed with the

01:28:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=01h28m16s">and his goal as a thinker was to

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=01h28m21s">and so to some degree he was looking for
a biological basis of morality that</a>
01:28:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=01h28m25s">might be one way of thinking about it or
at least to reconcile the idea of a</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=01h32m22s">on that and and part of it was as was
created by late Latham and Locke Gary</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=01h32m28s">Latham and Edwin Locke and they're
looking at goal-setting that's how well</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=01h32m32s">they described it as a means to improve

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=01h32m38s">imagined that you have two teams and you
get them to set goals and one team sets</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=01h32m48s">life and then you match them
head-to-head over some period of time</a>
01:32:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=01h32m52s">and see which one comes up

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=01h32m55s">goals for their life beat the people who

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=01h33m00s">really and then there's a variety of
other literature's that support that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23dArPpXgCM#t=01h33m04s">kind of hypothesis but it's it's it's
