<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h00m09s">But I really liked his courses-- he taught a course on creativity and he was also a prison psychologist</a>
00:00:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h00m15s">And he was an eccentric guy</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h00m17s">And he, for some reason, liked me and maybe because I was eccentric, too</a>
00:00:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h00m20s">And he invited me to go out to the Edmonton</a>

00:00:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h00m42s">met a little guy smaller than me. I was a little bigger by then and he was a pretty innocuous guy and</a>
00:00:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h00m50s">What had happened was I was out in this gymnasium</a>
00:00:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h00m53s">It looks like a high school the prison which is really quite telling in my estimation</a>
00:00:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h00m57s">But and there were all these like monsters in there weightlifting and like they were monsters</a>
00:00:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h01m01s">I remember one guy it was tattooed everywhere</a>
00:01:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h01m03s">And he had like a huge scar running down the middle of his chest it looked like someone had to hit him with an axe</a>
00:01:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h01m07s">And you know and and I was in there, and I had this weird cape that I used to wear that</a>
00:01:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h01m12s">I bought in portugal and some boots that went along with it and</a>
00:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h01m18s">Yeah, I was like an 1890s Sherlock holmes cape</a>
00:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h01m20s">And it was really like it was from the 1890s because this little village was up on a hill</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h01m25s">It was a walled city on a hill and they sold these things and I don't think they'd changed the style since</a>
00:01:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h01m29s">1890 and so I thought they were really cool, and so I was wearing that which wasn't perhaps the most</a>

00:01:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h01m44s">I was in the gymnasium and the psych are the psychologists left and God only knows I mean</a>
00:01:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h01m50s">That's what he was like and all these guys came or all these guys came around me you know and they were offering to trade</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h01m56s">their prison clothes for my cape and it was</a>
00:01:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h02m01s">It was like I was being made an offer</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h02m03s">I couldn't refuse you know and so I didn't I didn't really know what to do and then this little guy said something</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h02m08s">like that the pSychologist sent me to come and take you away or</a>
00:02:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h02m13s">Something like that and so I thought well better this</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h02m16s">Little guy than all these monsters, so we went outside the gym</a>
00:02:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h02m22s">Through some doors like school doors. We went outside the gym into the</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h02m26s">Exercise yard, I guess and we were wandering along and he was talking to me</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h02m30s">And he seemed like it kind of an innocuous guy</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h02m31s">And then the psychologist showed up at the door and motioned us back</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h02m35s">And so which was kind of a relief and so I went into his office</a>
00:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h02m39s">and he said you know that guy that you walked out in the yard with and I said yeah, he said he</a>
00:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h02m44s">He took two cops one night, and he had them kneel down and while they were begging for their lives</a>
00:02:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h02m49s">He shot them both in the back of the head and I thought</a>
00:02:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h02m53s">Hmm. That's</a>
00:02:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h02m57s">See the thing that was so interesting was that he was so innocuous</a>
00:02:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h03m01s">right because what you'd hope is that someone like that would be very much unlike you let's say and</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h03m07s">Certainly wouldn't be like someone innocuous that you'd met what you'd want</a>
00:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h03m10s">Is that the guy would be like you know half were wolf and half vampire so you could just tell right away that he was</a>
00:03:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h03m16s">A cold-blooded killer but no he was this sort of ineffectual little guy who?</a>
00:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h03m21s">Was certainly not ineffectual if you gave him a revolver in the upper hand and so</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h03m26s">So that made me think that made me think a lot</a>
00:03:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h03m29s">about the relationship between being innocuous and and being dangerous and then another thing happened, I met another guy out there and</a>
00:03:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h03m36s">Then a week or two later. I heard that he and a friend of his had held another guy down and</a>
00:03:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h03m43s">pulverized his left leg with a lead pipe like just</a>
00:03:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h03m47s">pulverized it and the reason for that was that they thought that he was a snitch, and maybe he was and</a>
00:03:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h03m53s">At that time I did something different instead of being shocked and horrified by that although. I certainly was I thought</a>
00:03:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h04m01s">How in the world could you do that because I didn't think I could do that</a>
00:04:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h04m04s">I didn't think that I thought that there was a qualitative distinction between me and</a>
00:04:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h04m09s">Those people and so I spent about two weeks trying to see if I could figure out</a>
00:04:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h04m15s">Under what conditions I could do that like what kind of psychological transformation</a>
00:04:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h04m19s">I would have to undergo to be able to do that, and so that was a meditative exercise</a>
00:04:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h04m24s">Let's say and it only took about ten days for me to realize that</a>
00:04:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h04m28s">Not only could I do that that it would be a hell of a lot easier than I thought it would be and that's sort</a>
00:04:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h04m33s">Of where that wall between me</a>
00:04:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h04m35s">and what jung described as the shadow started to fall apart and</a>
00:04:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h04m38s">That also was very useful because I started to wreck I started to</a>
00:04:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h04m43s">Treat myself as somewhat different entity because I hadn't been aware up to that point you know cuz I thought I was a good guy</a>
00:04:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h04m49s">And there's no reason for me to think that</a>
00:04:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h04m51s">Because you're not a good guy unless you've really made a bloody effort to be a good guy</a>
00:04:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h04m55s">you're just not it's not easy, and so you're probably a</a>
00:04:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h04m58s">Moderately bad guy, and that's a long ways from being an absolutely horrible guy</a>
00:04:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h05m03s">But it's also a long ways from being a good guy and so</a>
00:05:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h05m06s">But I had a little more respect for myself after that because I also understood that</a>
00:05:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h05m12s">There was a monstrous element to the human psyche that</a>
00:05:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h05m16s">That you needed to respect, and that was part of you that you should regard yourself in some sense as a loaded weapon</a>
00:05:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h05m23s">It's very useful around children to regard yourself as a loaded weapon because around children. You are a loaded weapon and the terrible</a>
00:05:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWojVJKdh1M#t=00h05m31s">Experiences that many children have with their parents are testament to that</a>
