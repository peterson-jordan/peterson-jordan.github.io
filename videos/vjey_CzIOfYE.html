<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h00m36s">I think we're in Vancouver</a>
00:00:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h00m41s">Well that's majestic</a>
00:00:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h00m46s">Hope you allow me a little</a>
00:00:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h00m51s">Jordan and Sam honored me to lead this debate or discussion, as you want to see it</a>
00:00:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h00m58s">And I think that creates some kind of responsibility</a>
00:00:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h01m04s">And here I want to talk to you about my responsibility and how I see it</a>
00:01:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h01m06s">And about my perspective on the responsibility that you too</a>
00:01:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h01m12s">I doubt that what will happen tonight is historic and that does not necessarily mean that it is good</a>
00:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h01m18s">There is a lot of bad history</a>
00:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h01m21s">If only it could be good and that is what I hope it will happen</a>
00:01:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h01m25s">The reason why I say historical is</a>
00:01:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h01m27s">That we are in an era when all the systems that helped us comprehend are all</a>
00:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h01m32s">She became crumbling. The university system collapses, the press collapses</a>
00:01:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h01m40s">And at the same time we have a network of people trying to build understanding in an alternative way</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h01m48s">And I must say that I cannot overcome the difficulties at this moment</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h01m52s">Here is the problem. That we, the network, are not completely in agreement with itself on some fundamental issues</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h01m58s">Sam and Jordan have some differences that prove this difficult</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h02m03s">What might happen tonight is that it could be some kind of failure that can make things worse</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h02m10s">We can make things clearer without benefit, it can be fun, or vice versa</a>
00:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h02m15s">But in the best case scenario, we will discover how to make meaningful the things that have prevented us before</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h02m22s">And if this thing happens, you will all get out and talk on your various networks, and you will have something to say about what we have updated.</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h02m31s">In our curriculum we have even been able to talk in depth about difficult topics</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h02m37s">Finally, we would like to ask you not to film and broadcast tonight's discussion on the Internet</a>
00:02:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h02m44s">Not only if we want to hide it on the contrary, we encourage you to discuss it</a>
00:02:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h02m48s">But we do wish we all had the absolute freedom to speak here</a>
00:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h02m54s">We are experimenting with situations that we have not tried before in the hope that we will reach a new place</a>
00:02:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h03m00s">OK</a>
00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h03m10s">And with that, I think we'll put Sam and Jordan into the conversation and see if we can head into discussions</a>
00:03:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h03m17s">That has proven challenges in the past</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h03m19s">Sam, Jordan</a>
00:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h03m21s">Thanks</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h03m28s">I think I'll start off by saying that ...</a>
00:03:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h03m32s">When we came up with the idea to do that a few months ago</a>
00:03:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h03m36s">I have some resonance here. Can this be reduced?</a>
00:03:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h03m40s">When Jordan and I decided to do it, it was after him</a>
00:03:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h03m45s">Those twisted podcast episodes</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h03m49s">And I joked at the time that we wanted a word of safety for this event</a>
00:03:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h03m56s">And that word came as a surprise as crab</a>
00:03:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h04m06s">You will know that things get dire when someone says that word</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h04m10s">I just want to explain my motivation to help me organize these debates</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h04m19s">I reached out to Jordan</a>
00:04:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h04m23s">At that time I had the idea of ​​seeing him in those conversations with other people</a>
00:04:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h04m28s">I saw him on a podcast with Joe Rogen, I heard him talk to Dave Robin</a>
00:04:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h04m32s">I heard him speak with Bert on Rogen's podcast</a>
00:04:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h04m35s">And I got a lot of admiration for him in those conversations</a>
00:04:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h04m41s">90 percent of what he says in those conversations</a>
00:04:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h04m43s">It surprised me that she was very wise, helpful and with clear intention</a>
00:04:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h04m48s">But 10 percent didn't, but we noticed ...</a>
00:04:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h04m52s">It is clear to me that you have seen these successful conversations with other people, and I respect them</a>
00:04:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h04m59s">I began to be surprised that I might be the problem</a>
00:04:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h05m03s">And I think I am the problem</a>
00:05:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h05m13s">Well, before you clap my hands, I think I didn't mean exactly what you understood</a>
00:05:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h05m17s">I think it's a good kind of problem for Jordan</a>
00:05:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h05m21s">Because it's exactly what happens in those 10 percent moments</a>
00:05:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h05m27s">And the things that don't happen, which I think have made our conversation very difficult</a>
00:05:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h05m31s">I think there are some things that we have to clear up between us</a>
00:05:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h05m35s">So I am looking to do so. Thank you, Jordan, for accepting to participate</a>
00:05:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h05m38s">It is an honor for me to share this platform with you. Needless to say, I believe Burt as a moderator</a>
00:05:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h05m43s">It is an obscene disregard for the role he should play on any other platform</a>
00:05:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h05m49s">Because, as you know, it was in one of my podcasts, and it was one of the best conversations I've ever had</a>
00:05:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h05m54s">Thank you Burt for doing this</a>
00:05:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h05m55s">Thanks, Sam</a>
00:05:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h06m07s">OK</a>
00:06:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h06m11s">I'm going to get straight to the topic</a>
00:06:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h06m15s">The thing is, I put out a poll a few days ago to see when people are talking in general and what they want us to engrave</a>
00:06:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h06m23s">I took my time to see this and wrote a lot of notes which is why I brought my laptop with me</a>
00:06:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h06m26s">By the way, my phone isn't here to check my email during the debate, discussion</a>
00:06:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h06m32s">I thought what I would do is maybe define what Sam and I agree to</a>
00:06:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h06m37s">Because there is a lot to spend on it</a>
00:06:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h06m40s">Then I find out what we do not agree on and this is what I was trying to arrange</a>
00:06:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h06m45s">And I want to see if we could have discussed it together and go ahead</a>
00:06:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h06m49s">I want to introduce the following. One of the things that psychologist Carl Roger said is</a>
00:06:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h06m56s">A good way to have a good discussion is to tell the other person what you think he or she thinks</a>
00:06:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h07m01s">Until he thinks what you say reflects what he thinks</a>
00:07:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h07m05s">Knowing this method is very useful if you have a discussion with an intimate partner, for example</a>
00:07:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h07m10s">You have to show them their argument in order for them to agree to it and this is very difficult</a>
00:07:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h07m14s">And this is what I'm going to try</a>
00:07:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h07m16s">So, the first thing is that I think</a>
00:07:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h07m20s">I think what drives you in part, if you are accurate, is that you are</a>
00:07:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h07m25s">You want to anchor the structure of morality on something solid</a>
00:07:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h07m29s">There are two things that you want to avoid. Rather, let me say two disasters</a>
00:07:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h07m35s">The first disaster that I defined as religious fundamentalism</a>
00:07:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h07m39s">And the other catastrophe of moral relativism</a>
00:07:39</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=00h21m02s">Because culture spoils us, so it is a human thing par excellence</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=01h47m01s">In very specific areas of time and space, to say so</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=01h47m06s">There is a sequence of moral intuition and the deeper the intuition, the more it functions as a universal truth</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=01h47m10s">Just as scientific fact is across contexts, so scientific truth is more profound</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=01h47m21s">Really basic because no matter what length of time and area you choose, you will encounter protons</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=01h47m34s">You have the same problem, that some of them are so specific that they can only work in the here and now</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=01h47m38s">And these are kind of even low-level impulsive intuition</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=01h47m43s">But some of them are very profound, for example, that direct you to make your claim</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=01h47m49s">In the moral picture, that infernal story is bad, and the heavenly story is good. I would say this is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h01m54s">There is a kind of differential level of survival based on those who really adhere to these practices</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h02m06s">As there is nothing special about oysters as necessary</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h02m12s">And if it's the example and just you get the real variables, then the whole edifice collapses</a>
02:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h02m19s">And then you just want to understand the variables at work - look, I don't know if the whole edifice comes crashing down.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h02m25s">It is not clear to me that you want to claim that</a>
02:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h02m28s">Because of one of the things that I said about the moral picture and "I think I am this."</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h02m43s">Hey, see how hard it seems to drip that I'm definitely not an enemy of the Enlightenment</a>
02:02:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h02m52s">I think there are types of enlightenment and I put Pinker in the same camp</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h02m55s">We overestimate the relative degree that it is as if everyone were barbarians and avowars</a>

02:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h03m13s">Regarding the problem most people have not yet enlightened them on some level</a>
02:03:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h03m17s">Look, I'm not an enemy of the Enlightenment but I think it has a long evolutionary history which is</a>

02:03:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h03m26s">The enlightenment certainly continues to evolve. My point is that we must be able to agree</a>
02:03:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h03m33s">That the existence of a worldview is guided by constant and honest engagement with reality</a>
02:03:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h03m42s">And yet as we can understand it is better than having a rigid view</a>
02:03:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h03m51s">Or based on unchanging ideas born of people who didn't have any of our current tools</a>
02:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h03m59s">Any of our thoughts about anything</a>
02:03:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h04m02s">Well, that depends on principles. This is based on principles</a>
02:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h04m04s">I would like to say "There are cases where this clearly applies but I think there are broad principles</a>
02:04:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h04m11s">Maybe we should stop, I think, because I'm starting to get tired</a>
02:04:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h04m17s">And I'm sure the others are also starting to feel tired</a>
02:04:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h04m23s">And I mean, there are principles on me of the kind that I've described to you</a>
02:04:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h04m30s">The idea of ​​these deep ethical primaries then appears, too, in the moral image upon which to depend</a>
02:04:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h04m38s">This is what I chase what these deep morals are and what is their source</a>
02:04:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h04m42s">Also, I am fully prepared to claim that I have in fact and in detail that these are ethical institutions</a>
02:04:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h04m47s">Look, this is where we disagree a little bit that as "Maybe we can touch this up tomorrow night."</a>
02:04:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h04m54s">It seems to me that in order for you to be able in your argument that the facts are there, and that you can extract</a>
02:04:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h05m04s">Rate it, and we already described why you want to do it because you want it to at least not go in that abolitionist direction</a>
02:05:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h05m11s">And wanting to anchor them in some kind of truth that seems fair enough, but the thing is that</a>
02:05:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h05m16s">Facts naturally exist for a very long time, right?</a>
02:05:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h05m21s">Let's say 3.5 billion years, the extent of the life cycle! It is the process of these facts in life</a>
02:05:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h05m25s">And that produced the implicit explanatory structures that guide our interaction with facts</a>
02:05:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h05m35s">And that is a prior implicit structure that emerged from this evolutionary cycle</a>
02:05:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h05m39s">It has a structure that mediates between us and the facts cannot be derived from the facts at hand</a>
02:05:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h05m48s">So the question is what is this structure, it is in both of our interests to obtain the truth</a>
02:05:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h05m53s">Because you're using that as a source of moral intuition it's like it's really agreed</a>
02:05:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h05m57s">This is the source of the moral sense</a>
02:05:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h05m59s">Well, obviously, we should stop until tomorrow</a>
02:05:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE#t=02h06m04s">Really, guys. I want to interrupt you both</a>
02:06:04</p>
