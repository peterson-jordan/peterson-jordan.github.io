00:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h01m36s">Then got wrapped up in this idea. I kind of was the I guess epicenter of the project</a>
00:01:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h01m42s">I did all the submissions and managed all the emails and all of that and then Peter and Alan</a>

00:01:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h01m58s">then there is the getting ready to go public so</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h02m17s">So what did, why did you leave Academia?</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h02m20s">I wish I could say that it was like this prescient thing. I saw the writing on the wall that it was going mad</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h02m25s">And I wanted out but really it was just a number of personal responsibilities and commitments that led me to now want to pursue</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h02m40s">But you were still interested enough to continue while with this project interested enough in the academic world. Yeah, I never really</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h02m47s">wanted to stop</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h03m15s">Enough to get an idea of what I was was looking at in a philosophical sense</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h03m19s">to answer questions that I was it was really deeply interested in mostly the question that drove me probably from about</a>

00:03:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h03m30s">What are they talking about when they say the word God and so I really got involved in talking about their thinking about religion</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h03m36s">that's what led me to religious and moral psychology trying to understand why people</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h03m47s">ultimately because I was you know</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h03m49s">That kind of a guy. I just wanted to find out what the I figure I live in the southeast US</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h03m55s">It's a really religious area. People talk to me about their belief in God all the time.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h03m59s">I hear it constantly at different levels from the you know, yeah</a>
00:03:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h04m05s">there's I kind of believe level all the way to the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h04m25s">They mean something very important to themselves and I wanted to figure out from a perspective that didn't rely upon</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h04m31s">The religious the theology or the religious mythology or narrative</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h04m40s">And so I became very interested in that and spent a number of years reading and writing about it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h05m30s">That's what led me to get curious about the grievance Studies canon ultimately. I see. okay. Peter, okay, let's hear sir</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h19m29s">Very sort of intangible idea. That's an objective reality can't exist that we can't grasp anything that everything is a construct</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h19m40s">prolific amounts of writing it just kind of fizzled because once you've</a>

00:19:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h19m51s">So we started seeing then the rise in materialist feminism first of all</a>
00:19:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h19m56s">And then within sort of critical race approaches</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h20m07s">Okay, so everything is a cultural construct</a>
00:20:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h20m10s">But we can't address anything</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h20m12s">If we don't accept that a certain group of people in a certain place at a certain time experience certain things</a>
00:20:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h20m18s">so what we're looking at now is an objective reality that oppression and systems of power exist, but but already</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h20m28s">Mm-hmm. Everything else is socially constructed so the funding</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h20m45s">So this this was the the change that happened then so now it's politically actionable and this I mean kimberlé crenshaw</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h20m52s">But this most explicitly when she said it's politics applied to postmodern theory, okay?</a>
00:20:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h20m58s">So we want to get this straight because it's very very important. So</a>
00:20:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h21m02s">you just you distinguish the postmodern movement from the Marxist movement because the Marxism Marxists were still moving in a</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h32m02s">Academics are doing so because I don't want to just blatantly call people cowards that I don't know</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h32m11s">Okay, because I think I think cowardice is one or fear and let's let's not fear</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h33m21s">but I'll say it like race and IQ or and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h33m32s">But I think that there are many factors</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h42m26s">Let's look here too. Like there's a very big difference</a>
00:42:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h42m30s">Let's get this very clear between a self-admitted satire</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h42m35s">Which had historical precedent and which has ethical justification,</a>
00:42:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h42m38s">even if you don't agree with the justification, and data fabrication.  Data fabrication occurs</a>
00:42:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h42m44s">When you put data forward and you claim that it's a truthful representation of a real-world situation.</a>
00:42:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h42m50s">And.. Obviously that's distinct from satire in comedy. Everyone understands that distinction.</a>
00:42:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h42m56s">Well, the idea is that</a>
00:42:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h43m00s">those rules were put in there for very good reasons and that is people wouldn't use that to advance their careers, which</a>
00:43:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h43m07s">And they wanted to hide the results so they don't didn't want anybody to see what it was</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h43m12s">So the problem with that is that it would as Sokol wrote that it would contaminate</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h43m22s">what the success of our project depended upon it being revealed so that no longer applies and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h43m36s">Yes</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h43m51s">Okay, so so well, yeah tell me about the proceedings when it goes to court. What kind of court is it going to I?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h44m00s">Don't know. I mean first let me even take a step back from there</a>
00:44:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h44m04s">so if you look at the timeline of events when this occurred and I have that off the top of my head, but</a>
00:44:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h44m13s">when I was found guilty from  IRB, re's been a series of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h44m49s">Yeah, so that was it for the IRB charge the open the data falsification charge is open and still being investigated</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhuQOVTFGw#t=00h44m56s">And that actually started I think like two or three days after we went public</a>
