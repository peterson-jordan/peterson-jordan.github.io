00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h00m02s">I have “decided” to “listen” to you</a>
00:00:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h00m05s">True? This is different from the usual way humans communicate</a>
00:00:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h00m09s">Because when they usually communicate, they do something like:</a>
00:00:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h00m12s">Well, now we're having a conversation -</a>
00:00:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h00m14s">- And I will tell you why I am right, and I will succeed in that, if you agree with me.</a>
00:00:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h00m19s">Or maybe you were having a conversation where ...</a>
00:00:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h00m21s">I don't know what you are trying to do, maybe you are trying to influence the person you are talking to</a>
00:00:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h00m25s">And that means you don't listen to them at all! You just think about what to say next</a>
00:00:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h00m28s">Well, but what I mentioned earlier is different from this .. What I mean is:</a>
00:00:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h00m31s">"You may have something to tell me, and for that, I'm going to listen for an opportunity -</a>
00:00:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h00m37s">- You tell me something that would be really helpful for me to know.</a>
00:00:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h00m40s">Thus, you can think of it as an extension of the "Piaget Effect" (Piaget's theory of cognitive development)</a>
00:00:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h00m46s">You know, "Piaget Theory" talks about the basics</a>
00:00:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h00m49s">The basic knowledge component, which is to describe how to search for knowledge</a>
00:00:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h00m53s">The process by which knowledge is created</a>
00:00:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h00m56s">Well ... if you agree with me at the time of the conversation, and I found out about it, then this means that my knowledge and knowledge are no more than they were before.</a>
00:00:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h01m01s">I just know, basically what I already knew</a>
00:01:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h01m03s">And maybe I'm happy about that, because as you know ... my previous knowledge has not been challenged</a>
00:01:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h01m06s">But I am no smarter than I was before.</a>
00:01:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h01m08s">But maybe you are different from me, and so on ..</a>
00:01:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h01m10s">When I listen, you're going to tell me something I don't like</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h01m13s">It might be trivial to me, or difficult, whatever</a>
00:01:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h01m17s">And maybe she'll tell me something I didn't know, and so I'm going to be less stupid than I was before</a>
00:01:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h01m21s">After that, I might feel less painful when I go through similar things in the future</a>
00:01:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h01m26s">This is a very useful thing to know - especially if you live with someone</a>
00:01:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h01m29s">And you're trying to - make a long, peaceful relationship with him, but he's different from you</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h01m34s">The way they view the world is different from you, and the facts that they deduce from their world are different from your own.</a>
00:01:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h01m38s">And although you will be steeped in the tendency to prove that you are right</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h01m45s">The truth in the end is that two minds are better than one</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h01m48s">Thus, perhaps 9 of the 10 things the other person tells you can be dispensed with</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h01m53s">Maybe even 49 of 50 things, but there is only one "thing"</a>
00:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h01m57s">All you need from this damned conversation is to know one thing you didn't know before</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h02m01s">And this one of the great things about excellent psychotherapy sessions is that the entire conversation is this way</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h02m08s">All you're trying to do is ... express the reality of the situation</a>
00:02:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h02m14s">As clear as possible - that's it!</a>
00:02:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h02m18s">And so ... the "Roger proposal" - and I'll tell you why he suggested it (Carl Roger)</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h02m25s">He was suggesting that if you had a conversation of this kind with someone, it would make the two of you a better person.</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h02m32s">It will make both of you mentally healthier.</a>
00:02:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h02m34s">So there is an implicit presumption that sharing the truth is therapeutic.</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h02m40s">Well, that's a very cool idea! I mean, it's a very profound idea!</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h02m44s">I think it is the deeper idea</a>
00:02:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h02m47s">It is the idea that</a>
00:02:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h02m49s">Underpinning Western civilization - although it is not only Western civilization</a>
00:02:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h02m55s">The idea that truth produces health</a>
00:02:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h02m57s">But for Roger, that was the main goal of the Psychotherapy Association</a>
00:02:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h03m01s">You came to see me because you want to get better</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h03m05s">You don't even know what that necessarily means, I don't even know - but we will know it together.</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h03m10s">But you come to me and say, "Look, things are not acceptable to me,</a>
00:03:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h03m14s">And maybe, there's something I can do about it. "</a>
00:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h03m16s">Therefore, this is the lowest prerequisite for engaging in psychotherapy</a>
00:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h03m19s">Something is wrong, you want to talk about it honestly, and you want it to be better than it was</a>
00:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h03m24s">Without that, the therapeutic relationship will not take off</a>
00:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h03m28s">And you might ask, "Well, what are the relationships that are therapeutic?"</a>
00:03:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h03m31s">The answer to this question will be: If you have a real relationship, it is considered a therapeutic relationship</a>
00:03:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h03m36s">If it is not, then what you have is not considered a "relationship", only God knows what you have</a>
00:03:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h03m40s">You are a slave, they are tyrants, you know ..</a>
00:03:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h03m43s">You two headbutt each other, it is a dispute over the hierarchy of dominance of the higher ranks.</a>
00:03:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h03m48s">Or, I don't know, like two cats in one barrel, or two people holding each other's necks</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h03m52s">But what you have, cannot be considered a "relationship."</a>
00:03:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h03m55s">okay then</a>
00:03:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h03m57s">"We might say, that the greater the communication between experience, awareness and behavior on the part of one individual."</a>
00:03:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h04m03s">This is a reference to the same idea I was describing in relation to "Jung" (Carl Jung)</a>
00:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h04m08s">So let's say</a>
00:04:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h04m10s">You come to talk to me, and you want things to get better</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h04m12s">Well, I will try to be "one thing" at least</a>
00:04:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h04m15s">Because if I was everywhere (distracted in conversation), you wouldn't trust anything I say.</a>
00:04:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h04m22s">You have no reason to believe that I can actually tell you ...</a>
00:04:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h04m26s">That I am really capable of expressing anything real</a>
00:04:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h04m29s">So the truth is something that emerges as a result of your diaspora gathering,</a>
00:04:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h04m34s">He knocked you and hit you for every ....</a>
00:04:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h04m36s">What do we tell her?</a>
00:04:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h04m39s">For all the impurities emerging from ... your soul, for the desire for a better world.</a>
00:04:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h04m46s">You have to be one and complete to make this happen.</a>
00:04:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h04m48s">And you do it, at least in part, by wanting to tell the truth.</a>
00:04:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h04m51s">"The more the ensuing relationship involves a tendency towards mutual communication with the same traits."</a>
00:04:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h04m57s">So, one of the things that totally affected me from "Rogers"</a>
00:04:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h05m02s">One of the things I try to do in my psychotherapy sessions</a>
00:05:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h05m04s">Above all, it is listening, focused listening</a>
00:05:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h05m07s">And then, while I'm listening, I'm watching, and also while I'm listening, there are things going on in my head</a>
00:05:07</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h06m19s">Difficult for anyone to find someone who really listens and listens to him</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h06m23s">And so, there's another really strange thing about this listening, and that's it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h06m26s">If you really listen to people, you will enjoy the strangest things!</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h06m29s">So fast that you wouldn't believe it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h06m31s">So if you were having a conversation with someone, and it was boring</a>
00:06:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h06m34s">It is because you are a stupid person! this is the reason</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h06m41s">Wombat, or albatross, or unicorn or something like that, they are strange creatures.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h06m46s">And so, if you are actually communicating with them, and they are telling you, how weird they really are</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h06m54s">So ... you can also ask questions, it's a good way to listen.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h06m57s">But, you know, one of Rogers' points is: Well, you have to be properly directed, in order to listen.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h07m03s">And the correct approach should be: “Look, what I want from this conversation,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h07m07s">It is to be where we end up, better than where we started from</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h07m12s">And if you don't really want to, then you should think: Why don't you seek it?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h07m16s">What could be your goal, and what would be better than that?</a>
00:07:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h07m20s">You walk away, smarter and more equipped to take on the world -</a>
00:07:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h07m24s">Than you were before the conversation, and that applies to the other party as well</a>
00:07:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h07m28s">Well maybe if you feel bitterness, resentful, angry, and anxious, you know - generally annoyed with the world,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h07m34s">So, this is not what you want</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h07m36s">You want the other party to go worse than it was, and you too! Because you are full of feelings of revenge.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h07m40s">But .. you know</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J24TGZDk960#t=00h07m52s">B) I want to hear what you have to say, so we can clarify that and move forward</a>
