<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h02m18s">much to what should be its chagrin is a collectivist narrative and of course there's some</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h02m24s">Utility in a collectivist narrative because we're all part of groups in different ways</a>
00:02:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h02m28s">But the collectivist narrative that I regard as politically correct is a pastiche of a strange</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h02m35s">Pastiche of post-modernism and neo Marxism and it's fundamental claim. Is that:</a>
00:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h02m39s">No... you're not essentially an individual you're essentially a</a>
00:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h02m43s">member of a group and</a>
00:02:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h02m45s">that group might be your ethnicity and it might be your sex and it might be your race and it might be any of the</a>
00:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h02m50s">endless numbers of other potential groups that you belong to because you belong to many of them and that you should be</a>
00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h02m57s">ssentially categorized along with those who are like you on that dimension in that group.That's proposition number 1.</a>
00:02:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h03m03s">Proposition number 2 is that the proper way to view the world is as a battleground between groups of different power.</a>
00:03:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h03m10s">So you define the groups first and then you assume that you view the</a>
00:03:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h03m15s">individual from the group context, you view the battle between groups from the group context</a>
00:03:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h03m20s">and you view history itself as a consequence of nothing</a>
00:03:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h03m23s">but the power maneuvers between different groups.</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h03m26s">That eliminates any consideration of the individual and at a very fundamental level and</a>
00:03:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h03m31s">also any idea for example of free speech because if you're collectivist at heart in this manner</a>
00:03:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h03m37s">There is no such thing as free speech.</a>
00:03:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h03m40s">It isn't that it's debated by those on the radical left and let's say the rest of us so to speak.</a>
00:03:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h03m45s">It's that in that formulation</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h03m47s">there's no such thing as free speech because for an</a>
00:03:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h03m50s">individualist free speech is how you make sense of the world in reorganize society in a proper manner.</a>
00:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h03m54s">But for the radical left type collectivist that's associated with this viewpoint of political correctness</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h03m59s">When you speak all you're doing is playing a power game on behalf of your group</a>
00:03:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h04m03s">and there's nothing else that you can do because that's all there is.</a>
00:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h04m07s">And not only is that all there is in terms of who you are as an individual now and how society should be viewed</a>
00:04:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h04m13s">It's also the fundamental narrative of history</a>
00:04:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h04m15s">For example, it's widely assumed in our universities now that the best way to conceptualize</a>
00:04:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h04m22s">Western civilization is as an oppressive</a>
00:04:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h04m24s">male-dominated patriarchy; and that the best way to construe relationships between men and women across the centuries is one of oppression of women by men.</a>
00:04:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h04m33s">That's like well look:</a>
00:04:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h04m35s">No hierarchy is without its tyranny.</a>
00:04:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h04m40s">That's an axiomatic truth: people have recognized that literally for thousands of years;</a>
00:04:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h04m45s">and hierarchies do tend towards tyranny and they tend towards the usurpation by people with power</a>
00:04:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h04m51s">But that only happens when they become corrupt, we have mechanisms in our society to stop</a>
00:04:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h04m57s">hierarchies from becoming intolerably corrupt and they actually work pretty well</a>
00:04:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h05m00s">And so and so I would also point this out, you know</a>
00:05:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h05m06s">don't be thinking that this is a debate about</a>
00:05:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h05m08s">whether empathy is useful or not or that the people on the con side of the argument are not empathetic</a>
00:05:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h05m14s">I know perfectly well as I'm sure Mr. Frey does that</a>
00:05:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h05m17s">hierarchies tend to produce situations where people stack up at the bottom;</a>
00:05:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h05m22s">and that the dispossessed in hierarchies need a political voice</a>
00:05:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h05m24s">which is the proper voice of the left by the way and the necessary voice of the left.</a>
00:05:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h05m28s">But that is not the same as proclaiming that the right level of analysis for our grand unifying narrative is that all of us are</a>
00:05:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h05m36s">fundamentally to be identified by the groups that we belong to and to construe the entire world as the battleground between</a>
00:05:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h05m43s">different forms of tyranny in</a>
00:05:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h05m46s">consequence of that group affiliation;</a>
00:05:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h05m48s">and to the degree that we play out that narrative, that won't be progress, believe me.</a>
00:05:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h05m52s">And we certainly haven't seen that "progress" in the Universities</a>
00:05:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h05m55s">We've seen situations like what happened in Wilfred Laurier University instead. We won't see progress</a>
00:05:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerFihalHxs#t=00h06m01s">What we'll return to is exactly the same kind of tribalism to characterize the left</a>
