<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h00m04s">You write in the book ''There is no faith, and no courage, and no sacrifice in doing what is expedient''</a>
00:00:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h00m12s">What do you say to those viewers that don't pursue their dreams and are locked into their careers because they are too afraid</a>
00:00:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h00m20s">To take risks and pursue something meaningful?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h00m23s">Jordan: Hm! Well, the first thing I would say is well, you should be afraid of taking risks and pursuing something meaningful</a>
00:00:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h00m29s">But you should be more afraid of staying where you are if it's making you miserable</a>
00:00:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h00m33s">it's like, the first thing you want to do is dispense with the idea that you get to have any- any</a>
00:00:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h00m39s">Permanent security outside of your ability to contend and adapt. It's the same issue with children.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h00m46s">You're paying a price by sitting there being miserable and you might say well the devil I know is better than the one I don't</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h00m51s">It's like- don't be so sure of that. The clock is ticking.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h00m55s">Interviewer: Yeah. Jordan: And if you're miserable in your job now and you change nothing in five years</a>
00:00:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h00m59s">You'll be much more miserable and you'll be a lot older</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h01m01s">Interviewer: But isn't it a luxury to pursue what is meaningful? Our viewers have mortgages. They have children. Jordan: Yeah. Interviewer: They have payments and loans</a>
00:01:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h01m09s">It's a luxury to pursue because we lack the resources. Jordan: Well, I don't think- I don't remember now</a>
00:01:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h01m14s">I'm not talking about what makes you happy</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h01m18s">It's a moral obligation to pursue what you find meaningful. And that doesn't mean it's easy</a>
00:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h01m24s">it might require sacrifice. If you need to change your job, to, let's say you have</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h01m29s">Family, and- and children and a mortgage, you have responsibilities</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h01m34s">You've already picked up those responsibilities. You don't just get to walk away scot-free and say ''Well, I don't like my job,</a>
00:01:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h01m40s">I quit!'' That's no strategy. But what you might have to do is you think well this job is killing my soul</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h01m45s">All right. So what do I have to do about that? Well, I have to look for another job</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h01m49s">Well, no one wants to hire me. It's like okay. Maybe you need to educate yourself more</a>
00:01:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h01m54s">Maybe you need to update your- your curriculum vitae, your resume. Maybe you need to overcome your fear of being interviewed</a>
00:01:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h02m02s">Maybe you need to sharpen your social skills</a>
00:02:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h02m04s">Like, you- you have to think about these things strategically if you're going to switch careers</a>
00:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h02m08s">You have to do it like an intelligent, responsible person, and that might take you a couple of years of</a>
00:02:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h02m14s">Of effort to do properly. Interviewer: When you say pursue something meaningful, is it important to have a vocation? I</a>
00:02:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h02m20s">Jordan: I think it's more important to- to have a an ethos, an ethic</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h02m25s">So I have a program for example called the Future authoring program</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h02m29s">Which is a writing program that enables people to</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h02m31s">Develop a vision for their life and then to develop a strategy. And so it's based on the idea</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h02m37s">Imagine that- and it's an extension of the ideas in the book, or at least something along the same lines-</a>
00:02:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h02m42s">The first thing that you want to do is figure out- imagine you were taking care of yourself</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h02m46s">Like you were someone you cared for- which is rule number 2, by the way-</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h02m50s">essentially.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h02m51s">Then you should figure out well if you could have what you needed and wanted, what would it be?</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h02m56s">What sort of friends would you have? What would your family relationships look like? How would you conduct yourself with your children?</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h03m02s">How would you educate yourself? You need to think through how it is that your life could be</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h03m08s">Properly arranged if you had that ability. And then you can aim at that. And the funny thing is is that if you do</a>
00:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h03m16s">Posit a goal of that sort and work towards it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h03m20s">you will move towards it! The goal will change because you'll learn things along the way but I mean I've- I've</a>
00:03:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h03m25s">dealt with hundreds of people in my clinical and consulting practice and we set a goal we develop a vision and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY#t=00h03m32s">Work towards it- and things</a>
