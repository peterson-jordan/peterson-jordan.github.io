and Pinocchio is off to be a celebrity.</a>
00:00:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h00m09s">And uh... the Cricket is watching.</a>
00:00:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h00m13s">And uh, Pinocchio basically...</a>
00:00:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h00m17s">Well, he's got some natural talent!</a>
00:00:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h00m18s">Because he's a puppet, and he doesn't have strings.
And he goes on stage with strings,</a>
00:00:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h00m23s">and then he drops his strings,
and the whole crowd is amazed.</a>
00:00:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h00m26s">And - the crowd should be amazed when that happens, right?</a>
00:00:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h00m29s">You can imagine, when a kid goes to school,
and shows some independence - that's actually gonna...</a>
00:00:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h00m39s">People are gonna notice that.</a>
00:00:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h00m41s">His his peers are gonna notice that,
the teachers are gonna notice that.</a>
00:00:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h00m43s">Maybe it's too much independence, even.</a>
00:00:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h00m46s">Right? But it's still- it is a remarkable thing, too, like..</a>
00:00:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h00m49s">It's so interesting, you know. You can see marked signs of independence in children...</a>
00:00:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h00m54s">Well, right from the time they're born, basically.</a>
00:00:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h00m56s">Because, that's one of the things,
that's really funny about infants,</a>
00:00:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h00m59s">is that, you know, when they're crying,
you always think: "Oh, the baby's..."</a>
00:00:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h01m03s">Well, you're crying, it's: "baby sad". It's like, no.</a>
00:01:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h01m06s">Heh, a lot of the time that baby is angry.</a>
00:01:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h01m08s">And the way that we know that, is because you could do facial expression coding on infants,</a>
00:01:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h01m15s">just like on adults, and you can tell,
what emotion they're expressing.</a>
00:01:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h01m19s">And very frequently, like, when the kid starts to recognize his mom...</a>
00:01:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h01m23s">Explicitly, because he or she knows the smell right away, pretty much, and the sound of the voice - but visually;</a>
00:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h01m30s">um... if someone, who comes in,
and it isn't who the baby wants,</a>
00:01:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h01m34s">(so generally, it isn't mom), the baby will start to cry.</a>
00:01:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h01m37s">But it's not because the baby's sad, 
generally, it's because it's angry!</a>
00:01:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h01m41s">That mom didn't show up,
and that's an early sign of will.</a>
00:01:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h01m44s">It's like, this kid has-
this kid wants things, like...</a>
00:01:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h01m47s">And it's perfectly willing to tell you about that!</a>
00:01:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h01m50s">And of course a two-year-old, who's having a temper tantrum, is in some sense doing the same thing.</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h01m55s">It's poorly integrated will and independence, obviously,
but it certainly runs contrary to what you want.</a>
00:01:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h02m01s">You don't want your two-year-old having a temper tantrum, in the middle of the toy store.</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h02m04s">It's extraordinarily embarrassing for you, and... well for you.</a>
00:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h02m08s">But it's also embarrassing for the two-year-old.</a>
00:02:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h02m10s">This is one of the reasons, I think, that that sort of thing should be... carefully socialized rapidly.</a>
00:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h02m16s">Because it's actually humiliating for the kid,
because other people don't like that.</a>
00:02:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h02m20s">And they're very judgmental about... Like, they won't
say anything, usually - but sometimes they will.</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h02m25s">But, they're not happy about the fact, that that's happening.</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h02m28s">And they will judge the child negatively.</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h02m29s">And so, you don't want your child to be behaving in a way in public,</a>
00:02:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h02m34s">that makes other people think badly of them.
It's, it's really... it's really not good!</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h02m40s">And so, part of your job as a parent, is to not expose your child to that sort of experience.</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h02m46s">Especially not repeatedly.
It's really hard on them!</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h02m50s">Or, they get narcissistic,
which is also really hard on them.</a>
00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h02m53s">It's just- it takes a lot longer to manifest itself.</a>
00:02:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h02m56s">So anyways, he's off on stage,
and Stromboli introduces him,</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h02m59s">and talks, about how wonderful this is going to be,</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h03m02s">and Pinocchio comes out on stage,
with his strings on, and drops them,</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h03m06s">and then, he falls down the steps and puts his nose in the hole, makes a fool out of himself.</a>
00:03:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h03m09s">And that's, when Stromboli-
First time Stromboli shows his true character.</a>
00:03:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h03m13s">Cause he just, really, yells and screams at him.</a>
00:03:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h03m17s">And he has his back to the audience,
Stromboli, while he's doing this,</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h03m21s">so he's not noticing, how the audience is reacting.</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h03m24s">Typical tyrannical parent, right? Who's not noticing,
that society is reacting a different way, than him.</a>
00:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h03m30s">And he's NOT happy about it.</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h03m32s">And Pinocchio of course, is dazed, and feels like a fool.</a>
00:03:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h03m35s">And he is a fool, so that's appropriate.</a>
00:03:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h03m38s">But then, Stromboli... hears the crowd laughing; and as soon as he turns around, he's like all smiles again.</a>
00:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h03m44s">And so, that's the first time you get insight,
into what sort of puppet master he is.</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h03m48s">He's there to please the crowd, and that's all.</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h03m50s">And he's there to look good in public.
But fundamentally, he's a tyrant.</a>
00:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h03m54s">And so... and I guess, that's the problem with false celebrity.</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h03m58s">Is that the negative spirit of the crowd,
becomes your master, right?</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h04m02s">Because to be a celebrity, you have to be a crowd pleaser.</a>
00:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h04m04s">And, if you're pleasing the kind of crowd,
who likes a celebrity like you, which is...</a>
00:04:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h04m11s">And there's not much reason for that,</a>
00:04:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h04m13s">then, it's not exactly like you're appealing
to the proper side of the crowd.</a>
00:04:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h04m17s">And you've become its puppet, one way or another.</a>
00:04:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h04m19s">And maybe it's rewarding you with
wealth, perhaps, and with attention.</a>
00:04:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h04m24s">But, fundamentally... it's not something
I would recommend, if you wanna stay</a>
00:04:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h04m30s">reasonably psychologically healthy,
for any reasonable amount of time.</a>
00:04:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h04m34s">You're gonna sell yourself out.
And I don't mean that in any casual way, you know.</a>
00:04:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h04m40s">Alright, so anyways.</a>
00:04:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h04m42s">Stromboli changes from the tyrant to the good father, in half a second.</a>
00:04:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h04m46s">He gives Pinocchio pat on the head,
despite the fact, that he's made a mistake;</a>
00:04:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h04m50s">looks all kind, and the show continues.</a>
00:04:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h04m52s">Now, the Cricket is not very happy about this.
He's sitting in the stage watching.</a>
00:04:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h04m57s">He's very angry and, let's say, disgusted by what's happening.</a>
00:04:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h05m01s">Partly because Pinocchio is making a fool of himself.</a>
00:05:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h05m05s">Now, that's an interesting thing, you know: human beings blush.</a>
00:05:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h05m10s">In fact, if I remember correctly, the name "Adam", you know, like Adam and Eve, is related to the capacity to blush.</a>
00:05:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h05m17s">Now, that comes from something I read
a long time ago, and that might be wrong.</a>
00:05:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h05m21s">But Adam does manifest shame in the sight of God,
so there is a relationship there.</a>
00:05:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h05m27s">But anyways, um...</a>
00:05:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h05m30s">People do make fools of themselves for public display.</a>
00:05:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h05m33s">And you can tell you've done that,
in some sense - not always - if you blush.</a>
00:05:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h05m37s">Because you've either said something you shouldn't have, and you know, you realize that.</a>
00:05:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h05m42s">Which is more like: you've tried to be funny, and gone a little bit too far.</a>
00:05:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h05m46s">And sometimes that can be really funny.</a>
00:05:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h05m48s">Or, you said something that you know to be false.</a>
00:05:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h05m53s">Manipulative, deceitful, beneath you,
um... any of those things.</a>
00:05:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h05m56s">And you'll have an automatic response to it.
You'd be ashamed and blush.</a>
00:05:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h06m00s">And one theory about that, is that you can trust people who blush.</a>
00:06:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h06m04s">And so... because you know, that their conscience will betray them.</a>
00:06:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h06m08s">And so, that even if they are lying, they tell you.</a>
00:06:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h06m10s">And so... it's an interesting theory, you know?</a>
00:06:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h06m13s">Because blush is definitely... like, it's a facial display!</a>
00:06:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h06m16s">You know, it's right out there where people can see it.</a>
00:06:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h06m18s">So...</a>
00:06:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h06m19s">You know, maybe that's true, maybe it isn't,
but it's kind of an interesting idea.</a>
00:06:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h06m22s">Anyways, the Cricket is not happy with what's going on.</a>
00:06:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h06m25s">He's not happy about Stromboli,</a>
00:06:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h06m27s">and he's not happy about the willingness of Pinocchio,</a>
00:06:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h06m30s">to make a fool of himself, to support this false celebrity.</a>
00:06:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h06m34s">And so...</a>
00:06:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h06m36s">I actually think, that's why the celebrity types like that, often get narcissistic and arrogant.</a>
00:06:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h06m41s">You know, it's because they-
they aren't paying attention...</a>
00:06:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h06m46s">They're not paying attention, really,
to what's happening inside of them.</a>
00:06:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h06m49s">They drown it out, because the glory and the money,
and all that, is so attractive and enticing,</a>
00:06:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h06m56s">they don't notice- they refuse to notice,
what price they're paying for it.</a>
00:06:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h06m59s">And they magnify up their grandiosity and their arrogance, to keep that stuff all under control.</a>
00:06:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h07m04s">And then of course, they get surrounded by sycophants, which is a really bad thing, right?</a>
00:07:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h07m09s">They get surrounded by people, who will tell them exactly, what they wanna hear.</a>
00:07:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h07m13s">And that's really bad, if what you wanna hear from other people, is not good for you.</a>
00:07:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h07m17s">To surround yourself with people,
who won't offer you genuine criticism,</a>
00:07:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h07m22s">or even genuine reward, it's the same thing.</a>
00:07:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h07m25s">Like you want for me, that I differentially reward and punish you,</a>
00:07:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h07m28s">in approximately the way,
that the good part of the crowd will.</a>
00:07:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h07m33s">That's what you want from all your friends.</a>
00:07:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h07m34s">Because then, your interactions with them can generalize out to the broader community, in a productive way.</a>
00:07:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h07m40s">And so, a good friend... you know, I mean,
your friends tend to be on the supportive side.</a>
00:07:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h07m44s">And perhaps that's appropriate,
assuming there's reciprocity.</a>
00:07:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h07m48s">But a good friend will also tell you when, one way or another,</a>
00:07:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h07m51s">when your behavior is starting to tilt in a direction,
that's going to make you unpopular with them,</a>
00:07:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h07m56s">and likely, unpopular with other people.</a>
00:07:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h07m58s">And of course, that's what a parent is supposed-
That's the prime job of a parent, in my estimation.</a>
00:07:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h08m03s">It's like, "Don't do that.
Other people will hurt you, if you do that."</a>
00:08:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h08m09s">"By exclusion, by threat, by failure to offer you an opportunity."</a>
00:08:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h08m14s">"Bad things will happen to you - so you can't do that."</a>
00:08:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h08m18s">And then, you're a representative of the social situation.</a>
00:08:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h08m21s">Which is exactly what you should be. Not a friend.</a>
00:08:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h08m24s">So...</a>
00:08:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h08m27s">[closes door]</a>
00:08:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h08m29s">Or at least, not precisely a friend.</a>
00:08:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuHjVvegRs8#t=00h08m30s">That doesn't make you an enemy,
it makes you better than a friend.</a>
