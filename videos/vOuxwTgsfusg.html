					<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h00m00s">The two on the left are Jonah.</a>
00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h00m04s">Jonah and the Whale.</a>
00:00:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h00m05s">So, the story of Jonah is an interesting one.
I'll just go over it very briefly.</a>
00:00:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h00m12s">There's a city, and the city is full of people who are sinful.</a>
00:00:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h00m16s">What does that mean? Well, "to sin" is an archery term, it means to miss the mark.</a>
00:00:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h00m20s">So these are people, who aren't oriented properly.
And so the city is in a chaotic state.</a>
00:00:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h00m25s">God tells Jonah, that he's gonna go to that city,
and tell them, just exactly what's up with them.</a>
00:00:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h00m29s">And Jonah thinks "No! I'm not going to do that." And why?</a>
00:00:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h00m34s">Well, that doesn't require much explanation.
It's like, how popular are you gonna be,</a>
00:00:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h00m38s">if you go to a city full of chaotic people,
and tell them, why they're stupid and wrong?</a>
00:00:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h00m43s">It's- Jonah thinks "No, I'm not going to do that.
I don't care, if God's telling me to do it."</a>
00:00:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h00m48s">So his conscience is telling him to do it,
or his destiny is telling him to do it,</a>
00:00:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h00m51s">or his orientation with higher morality is telling him to do it. You can read it any way you want!</a>
00:00:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h00m57s">And so, he thinks "No, I'm hopping on this boat, and
I'm getting as far away from that city as I possibly can!"</a>
00:00:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h01m02s">And so he does that, and then the storm comes up.</a>
00:01:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h01m05s">Cause God thinks "No, you're not getting away. If I told you to do something, you're not getting away from it."</a>
00:01:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h01m10s">A storm comes up. Well, what does that mean? Well, it's easy!</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h01m17s">Betray your destiny - and see, how long
it takes you to be... drowning in the storm.</a>
00:01:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h01m26s">It will happen immediately,
and of course it will!</a>
00:01:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h01m28s">Because what's calling you to be your best is exactly the thing,</a>
00:01:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h01m33s">that's pushing you forward, to manifest yourself most fully in the world!</a>
00:01:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h01m36s">It's what you need! You run away from that - the boat's gonna start to rock very, very quickly!</a>
00:01:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h01m42s">And well, you all know that!
You know that perfectly well. It-it's...</a>
00:01:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h01m46s">Hell, all you have to do is not study for an exam, that you know that's coming up;</a>
00:01:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h01m51s">to see everything start to... the storm water
start to rise, and everything start to rock.</a>
00:01:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h01m55s">It's pretty bloody obvious.</a>
00:01:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h01m57s">So anyways, he's on this boat, and there's a storm.</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h02m00s">And all of the people on the boat, who can't quite discriminate Chaos from weather,</a>
00:02:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h02m06s">because they haven't differentiated the world to that degree, think:</a>
00:02:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h02m09s">"Oh! The boat wouldn't be about to be swamped, if we hadn't- some of us hadn't done something stupid and wrong."</a>
00:02:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h02m17s">And, there's logic in that!</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h02m18s">Y'know, you might think "Well, God has nothing personal against you because of the storm, so you're confusing levels of analysis".</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h02m24s">But, you gotta give these people some credit.
It's like, maybe they did do something stupid.</a>
00:02:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h02m29s">Maybe they didn't caulk the damn boat properly.</a>
00:02:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h02m31s">Maybe the ropes aren't in as good a shape as they might be.</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h02m34s">Maybe they weren't paying attention to the weather,
when they went out on the ocean!</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h02m38s">You know?</a>
00:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h02m39s">Or maybe, they haven't made peace with their brother,
and so their hearts are bent and twisted out of shape,</a>
00:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h02m43s">so they don't make particularly good sailors.</a>
00:02:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h02m46s">It's like - the idea, that you encounter a storm
because you're stupid and wrong, is a really good idea.</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h02m51s">Even though it's not of infinite applicability.</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h02m54s">Anyways, they draw lots.
It's a primitive thing to do.</a>
00:02:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h02m58s">It's like "Well, it's someone's fault! We don't know who.</a>
00:02:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h03m01s">We're gonna throw someone overboard, the worst sinner.</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h03m04s">Obviously, that's what God wants - some kind of sacrifice."</a>
00:03:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h03m07s">So they all draw lots, and someone loses.</a>
00:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h03m09s">And then Jonah stands up
and says "Well, sorry guys.</a>
00:03:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h03m12s">Like, I know that I've got a problem
with God at the moment.</a>
00:03:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h03m14s">So it's probably me,
you better throw me over."</a>
00:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h03m17s">And they don't really want to,
but he finally convinces them.</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h03m19s">Over he goes! And the storm settles.</a>
00:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h03m23s">Well, you know...</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h03m27s">Sometimes if you're in a group of people, in an organization,</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h03m30s">there is someone in the organization,
whose head isn't screwed on exactly straight.</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h03m35s">And they know exactly why it is, and what they've
done wrong, and what puts them in that position.</a>
00:03:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h03m39s">And they are poisoning the entire enterprise.</a>
00:03:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h03m42s">And if you throw them overboard,
or better - if they agree voluntarily to leave,</a>
00:03:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h03m46s">then the storm will abate,
and everything will be okay.</a>
00:03:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h03m50s">So anyways, they throw [stutter] Jonah overboard, and a whale comes up</a>
00:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h03m54s">and swallows him, and takes him down to the bottom of the ocean.</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h03m56s">Well, we already know what that means,
because we watched Pinocchio.</a>
00:03:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h03m59s">It's like when God abandons you,
because you've abandoned your destiny,</a>
00:03:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h04m04s">and the storms come up - the probability, that you're going to be taken down to the to the depths, is extraordinarily high.</a>
00:04:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h04m11s">And that happens in people's lives all the time!</a>
00:04:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h04m14s">Also down there, Jonah repents.</a>
00:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h04m16s">Well, what do you do, when you in the Underworld?</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h04m19s">You've been there before: when things fall apart on you, or friends have abandoned you,</a>
00:04:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h04m22s">you're not as popular as you could be,
you can't stand to look at yourself in the mirror.</a>
00:04:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h04m26s">Into the Underworld you go! And you think:
"Geez, I've done a lot of things wrong.</a>
00:04:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h04m30s">You know, maybe I should reconcile myself with the world, and I could get out of this."</a>
00:04:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h04m34s">Well, so that's what Jonah does.</a>
00:04:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h04m35s">He thinks "Alright, I've got this destiny.
I better go do what God says."</a>
00:04:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h04m39s">So, whale spits him out onto the beach.
And off he goes - to the city, to tell them what's wrong.</a>
00:04:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h04m45s">Well... that's what that represents!
That's these symbols, you know?</a>
00:04:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h04m50s">It's so cool! This second one - I really like it, it's so interesting.</a>
00:04:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h04m54s">Because, you see Jonah re-emerging from the whale,
and he's got a halo around his head.</a>
00:04:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h04m58s">You say "well, what's a halo?"
Have you ever looked at a quarter?</a>
00:04:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h05m02s">Well, think about a quarter.
A quarter is the Moon.</a>
00:05:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h05m07s">And who's on the quarter? The queen!</a>
00:05:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwTgsfusg#t=00h05m09s">The queen is surrounded by the halo of the Moon!</a>
00:05:09</p>
