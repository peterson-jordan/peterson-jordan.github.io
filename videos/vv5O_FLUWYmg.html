00:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h01m27s">Warren - I suppose that my intentions are to see the evolution of perhaps all that time since 1969.</a>
00:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h01m34s">When the feminist movement emerged I was very interested in it</a>
00:01:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h01m37s">and I felt that women really needed to be able to be equally respected</a>
00:01:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h01m40s">and enter the workplace and have options open</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h01m43s">and he was upset that women weren't playing sports</a>
00:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h01m46s">to the degree that I felt that these sports were creating benefits for them.</a>
00:01:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h01m52s">I started to articulate this</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h01m53s">and I started talking to my dissertation advisers about doing this and their first reaction was:</a>
00:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h02m00s">"Warren, the women's movement is just a fad,"</a>
00:02:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h02m02s">and I said: "I think not, I think this is the beginning of change</a>
00:02:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h02m05s">of the gender roles of men and women ".</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h02m08s">I talked to them about this and finally convinced them that I could change my dissertation</a>
00:02:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h02m14s">and that led me to be seen now as a receptive man</a>
00:02:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h02m20s">at a time when the feminist movement</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h02m22s">I was getting a lot of accusations of hating men</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h02m25s">so I served the purpose that here is a man of flesh and blood who stands up for what we stand for,</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h02m33s">gets up and says what we say, it's going to be harder to label them "man haters."</a>
00:02:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h02m37s">I started doing that so I started doing that</a>
00:02:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h02m40s">And I ended up talking around the world about women's issues</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h02m43s">and the value of women having sufficient confidence and competence</a>
00:02:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h02m48s">to be able to share the burdens of earning the bread that men have.</a>
00:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h02m52s">And that was my focus until the mid-seventies</a>
00:02:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h02m56s">and in the mid-seventies I began to see that the feminist movement had made a lot of progress</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h03m02s">and everyone was signing up, at least those who were high up in the middle class and educated.</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h03m14s">But there were also a huge number of divorces going on</a>
00:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h03m17s">and I started to say that it is important for the children</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h03m21s">having both parents after the divorce.</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h03m23s">Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem and a woman named Karen DeCrowe agreed with me</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h03m27s">but the ONM, was on the ONM Board at that time,</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h03m31s">had been elected as a result of work for the Board of ONM</a>
00:03:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h03m36s">and my colleagues on the current Board said:</a>
00:03:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h03m43s">"We have a dilemma</a>
00:03:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h03m44s">and the dilemma is that there are women who are writing to us saying that they are going to leave the ONJ</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h03m49s">if they do not have the option to determine what happens to the children after the divorce</a>
00:03:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h03m54s">and we don't want to lose members because it's not only important for family purposes</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h04m01s">but for the rest of the agendas we have. "</a>
00:04:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h04m03s">I said: "The important thing is not the rights of women or men,</a>
00:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h04m08s">the important thing is to know what is best for the children ",</a>
00:04:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h04m10s">and they said, "Yeah Warren, cool theory, but we really need to focus on</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h04m14s">empower women across a broad spectrum. "</a>
00:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h04m17s">They ended up voting in terms of</a>
00:04:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h04m20s">give women the option to be fully involved with their children</a>
00:04:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h04m24s">or not depending on the appearance that women are the ones who know their children best</a>
00:04:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h04m29s">and therefore they know what is best for their children.</a>
00:04:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h04m32s">So the ONJ and I started to have a significant amount of tension around that idea.</a>
00:04:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h04m36s">and Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem didn't get involved, they weren't on the ONM Board.</a>
00:04:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h04m40s">All the other NOM Boards of the country</a>

00:04:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h04m47s">and that led to my departure and I also started forming hundreds of men's groups,</a>
00:04:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h04m55s">one of whom was joined by John Lennon,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h04m58s">and that had a great impact on people in both groups and I began to see what the pain of men was.</a>
00:04:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h05m06s">I began to articulate the pain of men as well as that of women in my presentations</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h05m13s">And when I was just articulating the pain of women and the challenges of women,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=00h05m30s">when I began to integrate the perspectives and feelings of men from men's groups,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=01h20m25s">Carl Rogers had good advice on that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=01h20m40s">don't assume either you or they know what they are talking about or what they are going to say.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=01h20m45s">Because people think through speech,</a>
01:20:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=01h20m49s">so you have to give them a chance to say it all before criticizing it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=01h21m17s">Because that, first, indicates to the speaker that the listener, in fact, heard</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5O_FLUWYmg#t=01h21m30s">It also forces the listener not to turn the opponent into a scarecrow</a>
