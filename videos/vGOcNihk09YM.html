<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h02m49s">And those possibilities and limitations are
expressed most particularly in our physical</a>
00:02:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h02m53s">form; the fact that we have a specific kind
of embodied form that allows us to do certain</a>
00:02:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h03m00s">things, and it also doesn’t allow us to
do certain other things.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h03m04s">Lao Tzu has pointed out that it’s the space

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h03m12s">And… what he means by that is that… those
things that limit you give you as much form</a>
00:03:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h03m19s">and possibility, as those things that enable
you.</a>
00:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h03m23s">What that means, more broadly, is the fact
that you’ve come to a given circumstance</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h03m26s">with a set of possibilities and a set of limitations.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h03m29s">It’s that, that allows you to impose form
on what you encounter, so that the whole notion</a>
00:03:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h03m34s">of form is a tenet in some peculiar way that
we don’t really understand yet on the necessity</a>
00:03:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h03m40s">of limitation.</a>
00:03:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h03m42s">And I think the best way to understand that,
or to begin to understand that, is to give</a>
00:03:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h03m45s">some consideration to the notion of a game.</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h03m48s">So, for example, if you’re playing chess,
there’s a virtually unlimited number of</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h03m52s">things you can’t do, and only a very narrow
number of things that you can do.</a>
00:03:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h03m57s">Yet, when you’re playing chess, the arbitrary
limitations that are imposed on each piece</a>
00:03:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h04m02s">don’t seem to be unfair in any sort of cosmic
sense.</a>
00:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h04m06s">They seem to be part of the structure that
enables you to actually play the game.</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h04m10s">Without the imposition of those rules, which
are of course relatively arbitrary in the</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h04m14s">structure, there wouldn’t be a game at all.</a>
00:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h04m16s">Now, it’s clear that, for human beings,
games and fantasy for that matter shade up</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h04m23s">into reality, so that the game structures
that we engage in and the fantasy structures</a>
00:04:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h04m28s">that we use to under­gird our stories and
our pretend play, say when we’re children,</a>
00:04:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h04m34s">shade imperceptibly into real life.</a>
00:04:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h04m36s">We­We play games because there’s something
about games that make them deeply analogous</a>
00:04:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h04m41s">to what we do in day­to­day situations.</a>
00:04:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h04m44s">And that means, the observation that the rules
of a game actually make the game possible</a>
00:04:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h04m49s">is an observation that’s broadly applicable
to consideration of your own limitation</a>
00:04:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h04m55s">Some of those limitations and possibilities
take the form of emotions and motivations,</a>
00:04:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h05m00s">and we know, I think, incontrovertibly regardless
of the claims of social scientists who are</a>
00:05:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h05m06s">more relativist in their orientation, that
human beings come into the world with a standard</a>
00:05:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h05m11s">set of biological predispositions – emotions
and motivations.</a>
00:05:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h05m16s">And furthermore, I think we know that it’s
the fact of those shared emotions and motivations</a>
00:05:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h05m21s">that allow us to communicate at all.</a>
00:05:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h05m28s">And then, imagine further that a consequence
of that… lengthy process of interpersonal</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h05m34s">negotiation is the emergence of a tremendously
complicated game, and not one that’s arbitrary,</a>
00:05:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h05m40s">because the game has to have certain rules
in order for it to be played at all.</a>
00:05:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h05m44s">So, for example, we know that even with rats,
If rats-- They like to engage in rough-and-tumble</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h05m50s">play, and if you put two rats together – juvenile
rats – one rat almost always dominates the</a>

00:05:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h05m56s">It only takes about a 10% gain in weight on
the part of one rat for it to be pretty much</a>
00:05:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h06m02s">stability dominant.</a>
00:06:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h06m03s">And it’s always the subordinate rat that
introduces play, or-or-or uh, asks for play.</a>
00:06:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h06m09s">But it turns out that even among rats, if

00:09:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h09m25s">you start to became-- become to abstract out,

– because Nietzsche said at the end of the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h10m03s">It’s a mistake to assume that there was

00:10:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h10m12s">It’s much more reasonable to presuppose
that the order emerged naturally, over lengthy</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h10m18s">periods of time, and then was interpreted

in large part is the processes by which that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h10m28s">order comes to be.</a>
00:10:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h10m29s">So, you say, first, it’s behavioural, emotional,
motivational.</a>
00:10:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h10m33s">People, and even animals, communicate in a
way that makes their motivational and emotional</a>

00:10:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h10m39s">So, even among wolves and chimpanzees and
any kind of lower-order social animal, you</a>
00:10:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h10m43s">have the emergence of dominance hierarchies,
fundamentally, which are stable solutions</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h10m49s">to the entire set of emotional and motivational
problems that besets the group.</a>
00:10:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h10m53s">And no one would ever say that the emergence
of a chimpanzee dominance hierarchy is a consequence</a>
00:10:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h10m58s">of rational deliberation.</a>
00:10:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h11m00s">So then, imagine that chimpanzees get the
power to watch what they’re doing and to</a>
00:11:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h11m04s">start to represent it.</a>
00:11:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h11m06s">And then, imagine furthermore that that representation
takes the form of stories and, then, laws.</a>
00:11:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h11m11s">And then, you have some idea about h-how human
social order comes to be.</a>
00:11:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h11m15s">And this is an exciting possibility for me
because it offers-- it offers the potential</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h11m20s">solution to one major question, which is:
How is it that people should act?</a>
00:11:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h11m27s">And because we’re essentially rationalist
in our presuppositions, we believe that there</a>
00:11:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h11m31s">are rationalist solutions to that.</a>
00:11:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h11m33s">But the solutions may be something that are
much more akin to biological solutions.</a>
00:11:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h11m39s">So, first, I want you to consider the following
hypothesis.</a>
00:11:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h11m47s">OK, so, we’re going to make the presupposition
– a couple of presuppositions that I don’t</a>

we are essentially animals, that we’ve evolved</a>

were around as creatures before we were capable</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h12m06s">of thinking in words, to say, much of that

00:12:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h12m12s">So, we think more like biological entities
than we think like computers.</a>
00:12:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h12m15s">Or, we think more like biological entities

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h12m19s">But of course, we already know that rational

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h12m32s">So then, you might say: Well, why is it that,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h14m13s">But then, if you go way, way back in history
– maybe 500,000 years when our cognitive</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h14m19s">capacities were first starting to develop

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h14m22s">the world was really like, what categories

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h14m31s">And then, you might think: You can only talk
about what you don’t know in terms that</a>

00:14:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h14m40s">It isn’t absurd to presume that for the
human being, the world is the mother, first,</a>
00:14:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h14m48s">as a projection, right, as an a priori, cognitive

00:14:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h14m56s">The hypothesis being: The natural world which

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h15m02s">mother – partakes in many ways of the same
properties as the mother.</a>
00:15:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h15m06s">It’s a working hypothesis, just like you
might presume if you date a new woman, that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h15m23s">So, we use our fundamental, social cognitive
categories initially to portray the world.</a>
00:15:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h15m30s">And the world’s nature is portray and personified,
or metaphorical form.</a>
00:15:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h15m34s">And so then, the question is: What are the
primary categories?</a>
00:15:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h15m38s">Well, we have three of them here.</a>
00:15:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h15m40s">But they’re not the only three because this
is all good, this category system – the</a>
00:15:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h15m44s">benevolent mother, the benevolent father,
and the hero.</a>
00:15:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h15m47s">Well, we know the world is not only benevolent,
it’s also malevolent.</a>
00:15:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h15m51s">Or at least, we can say that because we’re
equipped with certain emotional possibilities</a>
00:15:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h15m56s">and certain motivational possibilities the
probability that we will encounter despair</a>
00:15:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h16m03s">and frustration and disappointment, and anxiety
is just as real as the possibility that we</a>
00:16:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h16m09s">will encounter and hope, and satisfaction.</a>
00:16:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h16m11s">So, for us, the world is bivalent.</a>
00:16:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h16m14s">It takes with one and it gives with the other.</a>
00:16:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h16m16s">And that’s true for the natural world, which
produces us and destroys; as it is for the</a>
00:16:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h16m21s">social world, which fosters our development
and crushes our individuality; and as well</a>
00:16:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h16m26s">for the individual, who in many regards is
as admirable a creature as you can hope ever</a>

who’s capable of unbelievable depths of</a>

00:16:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h16m39s">So… a world that’s not only divided into
three fundamental categories, but each category</a>
00:16:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h16m46s">divided into a structure that’s essentially
ambivalent in its fundamental element.</a>
00:16:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h16m52s">And of course, that poses the central existential
problem for human existence, doesn’t it?</a>
00:16:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h16m57s">I mean, we’re faced with the vagaries of
the natural world and what we don’t understand;</a>

arbitrary and unreasonable demands on us;</a>
00:17:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h17m06s">and the fact of our capacity for transcendence,
tied to our own vulnerability.</a>
00:17:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h17m11s">And you could say perfectly reasonably that,
regardless of where you’re situated in time</a>
00:17:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h17m16s">and space, those are basically your problems.</a>
00:17:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h17m18s">And your goal through life – your path through
life – is going to be characterized by the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h17m23s">solutions you either come up with or don’t
come up with to that set of problems.</a>
00:17:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h17m28s">OK, so, there’s one more categorical element
that complicates this picture.</a>
00:17:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h17m38s">And I think, in many ways, it’s the most
difficult thing there is to grasp.</a>
00:17:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h17m42s">So, we’ll take a shot at it first.</a>
00:17:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h17m44s">And I’ve showed you this representation
before.</a>
00:17:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h17m48s">This is the dragon of chaos, and you can think
of the dragon of chaos as a symbol of totality.</a>
00:17:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h17m54s">And furthermore, you can think of it in relationship
to this structure… as the source of this</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h18m04s">structure… or even as the source of all
structure.</a>
00:18:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h18m09s">So, you see in the Sumerian creation myth,
for example, the character of Tiamat, right?</a>
00:18:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h18m14s">And I told you that the world Tiamat is associated
with the later Hebrew word “Taom”, which</a>
00:18:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h18m19s">means chaos.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h18m20s">And Taom is the chaos that Yahweh makes order
out of; makes the world out of.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h18m25s">So, the idea lurking behind the Sumerian creation
myth - and then, later, lurking behind the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h18m42s">Now, what in the world can that mean?</a>
00:18:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h18m44s">Well, it means something like this.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h18m46s">Let’s look at the concrete metaphorical
representation.</a>
00:18:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h18m50s">And first of all, you have a kind of totality
here, right?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h20m12s">The world in itself is a complex array of
patterns.</a>
00:20:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h20m17s">And those patterns manifest themselves in

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h20m22s">And I think the best way to get a grip on
what those patterns might be like is to think</a>
00:20:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h20m26s">of them in terms of music.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h20m28s">And I think that’s what music represents.</a>
00:20:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h20m30s">Music is this complex three-dimensional structure,
full of interwoven patterns of different dimensions</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h20m38s">and length that expends itself over time.</a>

can concentrate on one instrument or another,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h20m50s">You can parse out different elements from

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h20m53s">And that’s especially the case with very
sophisticated orchestral music, right, which</a>
00:20:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h20m57s">is susceptible to multiple reinterpretations,
and multiple encounters, because of its complexity.</a>
00:20:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h21m04s">And this is to say only that what you look
at is far more complicated than what you see.</a>
00:21:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h21m11s">Or to say, alternatively, that there’s more
information in anything you perceive than</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h21m18s">And that’s partly because, It’s partly
because your perceptual systems delude you.</a>
00:21:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h21m25s">So, we think you look with your eyes or with

00:21:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h21m29s">But that’s only true when you’re looking

00:21:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h21m32s">right?</a>
00:21:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h21m33s">When you’ve already built perceptual machinery

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h21m44s">It’s not-- It’s not precisely a perceptual

00:21:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h21m46s">It’s something much more deeper and primordial
than that.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h21m50s">And it’s more like: Oh no.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h21m53s">Something that I cannot categorize – either

00:21:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h22m00s">And the first categorization is this: That’s
it.</a>
00:22:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h22m03s">There’s-There’s nothing under that.</a>
00:22:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h22m05s">It’s merely fear plus heightened attention.</a>
00:22:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h22m09s">And that prepares the ground for constructing
a more detailed representation.</a>
00:22:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h22m13s">But that first encounter, that’s the encounter
with the dragon of chaos.</a>
00:22:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h22m25s">So then, you take this figure – the source
of all things, the… the Dao in some ways</a>
00:22:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h22m30s">– and you say: Well, how does it manifest
itself?</a>
00:22:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h22m35s">And the answer to that is something like this:
And, we see this both in the-- in-in the Mesopotamian</a>
00:22:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h22m46s">and the Egyptian myths that I described to

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h22m50s">The first division of the great dragon of
chaos, or the primordial egg is always into</a>
00:22:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h22m54s">two subordinate elements: The great father,
and the great mother.</a>
00:22:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h22m59s">Why is that?</a>
00:22:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h23m00s">Well, it’s illustrative of a fundamental--
of the fundamental binary nature of existence,</a>
00:23:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h23m06s">I guess; partly, you could say: If you’re
a cognizant being – a defined delimited</a>
00:23:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h23m14s">being – what you perceive always has a binary
structure.</a>
00:23:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h23m18s">There’s the aspect of you that structured
enough to allow the perceiving.</a>
00:23:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h23m22s">That’s what you know.</a>
00:23:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h23m23s">That’s-That’s the manner in which you’re
structured so that you can even… so that-that</a>
00:23:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h23m28s">you can even formulate a perception – something
a child builds up over time from the primordial</a>
00:23:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h23m33s">aspect, say, of his visual system or his auditory

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h23m39s">machinery that allows the complex patterns
that make up the world to be turned into objects.</a>
00:23:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h23m44s">So, there’s the thing - the structure that
allows the perceiving and then, there’s</a>
00:23:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h23m48s">the thing that’s being perceived</a>
00:23:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h23m51s">or the thing behind that.</a>
00:23:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h23m52s">And this is a very complicated distinction.</a>
00:23:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h23m55s">You can say: Well, what’s the difference
between the dragon of chaos - say, the representation</a>
00:23:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h24m00s">of the cosmos as such - and the great mother?</a>
00:24:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h24m06s">And I would say, it’s something like this…</a>
00:24:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h24m09s">The unknown that appears in relationship to
a perceiver is different than the unknown</a>
00:24:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h24m16s">as such.</a>
00:24:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h24m17s">So, I would say this, for example: There are
going to be things that surprise you that</a>
00:24:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h24m21s">wouldn’t surprise me, and vice versa.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h24m24s">And the things that would surprise you have
to be construed in relationship to what you--</a>
00:24:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h24m28s">to what you already know, ‘cause you’re
only going to be surprised by things you don’t</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h24m37s">But what we know is going to vary somewhat.</a>
00:24:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h24m39s">So, the unknown for you is going to be different

00:24:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h24m44s">And the great mother is a representation of
the unknown for you, for the unknown for me.</a>
00:24:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOcNihk09YM#t=00h24m51s">Different for everyone in some sense, because
we’re all going to be…</a>

things you don’t understand, and you encounter</a>
