00:00:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h00m11s">And certainly this is the main issue</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h26m30s">Like saying, "Well if I can have that then my life will be worth the trouble, even if I have to struggle for a reasonable time along the way."</a>
00:26:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h26m36s">This is what you are trying to build, and you can think of it as a paradise worth moving towards</a>
00:26:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h26m41s">The second part of the program asks you to write about what your life could be like in the next three to five years if all of your bad habits and nihilistic tendencies were.</a>
00:26:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h26m51s">And your tendency towards resentment and loss of desire to take responsibility if all your weaknesses control and knock you to the ground</a>
00:26:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h26m58s">And everyone knows that.You know what it would be like if you let everything slip and know what hell you'd be headed towards</a>
00:26:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h27m06s">So the second part of the program asks you to write about what your life might be like over the next three to five years if everything around you ended up in hell.</a>
00:27:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h27m13s">So it gives you a hell to avoid and a paradise to look towards</a>
00:27:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h27m16s">And you need both because that is what keeps you properly motivated in life</a>
00:27:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h27m20s">Then, the second half of the program, which represents the next section of the program, helps you transform your vision for the desired future into an achievable reality.</a>
00:27:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h27m29s">And its word complementarity and the pronunciation of arguments for why you want it</a>
00:27:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h27m34s">It also helps you overcome your own doubts because you don't have to argue against other people only</a>
00:27:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h27m38s">It means arguing against the gossip of the demons of nihilism, despair, and ideological monarchy that exist within your mind and society at the same time.</a>
00:27:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h27m47s">You need powerful weapons to fight against them</a>
00:27:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h27m50s">And here is this offer. We have made a "future authoring program" available for free for the coming period. I don't know how long the period will be, but let's assume a week or something like that.</a>
00:27:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h28m01s">If you go to ((the address is written in the picture))</a>
00:28:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h28m12s">You can read about the program there, and now I have to tell you that we have used this program on about 5,000 university students, most of them in the Netherlands but some in Canada as well.</a>
00:28:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h28m21s">And what we showed is that if you complete the program, even if you do it badly, and I advise, "Do it badly, man" it doesn't matter that you do it in an excellent way.</a>
00:28:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h28m31s">Do it badly and maybe later you can do better as you progress, but at least it does badly</a>
00:28:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h28m35s">This program increases the performance of university students, increases their grades between 20 to 25 percent and reduces their withdrawal from studies by the same percentage.</a>
00:28:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h28m43s">So we have a statistic of 5,000 people and one of these articles has been published and I will link to it in the description of the video</a>
00:28:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h28m51s">So this program really works if you use it so I highly recommend that you do so</a>
00:28:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h28m56s">In any case, you can read about this program from there and click on buy for 14.95 and then enter this code (changeyouself) * Note This may be for the offer now ending</a>
00:28:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h29m09s">This is what millennials would have to do if they wanted to change the world</a>
00:29:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h29m12s">The first thing they have to do is direct themselves to do good, and this is away from evil, away from hatred, away from vain, pretended suffering, and pain.</a>
00:29:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h29m22s">Or rather let us say far from Auschwitz * a Nazi internment camp in Poland * and away from the "Gulag Archipelago" and the heinous Soviet concentration camps and the mass murder that took place in China</a>
00:29:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h29m30s">So you want to get as far away from it as possible as you can</a>
00:29:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h29m33s">Any direction away from that is a good trend</a>
00:29:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h29m37s">After that, you should think about the highest possible good that may appear to you, your family, and your community, as we have already discussed that</a>
00:29:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h29m44s">Then you have to speak the truth as related to that</a>
00:29:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h29m47s">Then you have to educate yourself</a>
00:29:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h29m50s">After that, you have to assume your responsibility, and responsibility is good because it makes you strong under its weight, it makes you strong and enables you to free yourself from your strings.</a>
00:29:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h30m01s">And turn yourself into an honest individual, and then take on the world</a>
00:30:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h30m05s">And then you're in a position to make a change</a>
00:30:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h30m08s">As a person like this, your pure existence will change the world in a positive direction</a>
00:30:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h30m14s">This is what you should strive for: Read the books that I have posted on my site. Create a "Creating the Future" program and this will improve your life greatly</a>
00:30:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOeO_frzvg#t=00h30m22s">In this way, you can change the world</a>
