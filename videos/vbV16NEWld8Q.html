					<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h00m09s">so I hope we can... my plan is to finish this today</a>
00:00:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h00m15s">and then we'll go into the more concrete details now that you've got some sense of the way that a narrative like this can unfold</a>
00:00:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h00m23s">if you remember, we were just leaving this terrible little bar, which I think was called the Red Lobster</a>
00:00:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h00m31s">something like that; where the fox and the cat had met the coachman</a>
00:00:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h00m35s">and the Coachman is obviously someone who takes you somewhere, he takes you on a trip</a>
00:00:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h00m42s">and the coachman basically revealed himself, first he kinda looks like a, I guess a somewhat jolly old man</a>
00:00:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h00m48s">although his expression doesn't precisely read as jolly</a>
00:00:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h00m53s">and then he reveals himself as something positively satanic</a>
00:00:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h00m58s">and that's enough to terrify these two-bit thugs, the Fox and the Cat</a>
00:00:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h01m02s">who think they're tough, but really aren't tough at all</a>
00:01:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h01m06s">and so they see at some point what they're really tangled up in</a>
00:01:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h01m10s">and I think I mentioned to you that that was something akin... Jung had this idea that people's shadows reach all the way down to hell</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h01m18s">which is actually a very frightening concept, and what he meant by that is</a>
00:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h01m22s">if you take a look at the impulses that drive you that are actually malevolent, if you can admit to such impulses</a>
00:01:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h01m29s">that if you basically follow those all the way down to their origin, you can find some very nasty things</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h01m36s">and what you find down there basically is what allies you with people who've done terrible things</a>
00:01:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h01m42s">and that's not a very pleasant experience, I would say</a>
00:01:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h01m48s">although one thing that's worth thinking about is that it is something that can protect you against being very very badly hurt</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h01m57s">because one of the things that characterizes people who develop post-traumatic stress disorder</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h02m03s">is that they're often naive, and then they encounter something that's really not within their framework of thinking</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h02m09s">and it's usually something bad, and because there isn't anything in their philosophy, their way of looking at the world</a>
00:02:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h02m15s">that has prepared them for that, they end up fragmented and devastated</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h02m20s">it's actually protective to you if you can figure out what your full range of capabilities is</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h02m28s">because that can help you understand other people a lot better, and to be wiser and more careful in your actions</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h02m36s">it's also useful, I think, if you want to convince yourself to act properly</a>
00:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h02m42s">because if you regard yourself as harmless, which is a big mistake, then nothing you can do is really that bad</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h02m51s">right? because you're harmless, after all; but if you understand that you're seriously not harmless</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h02m56s">then that can make you a lot more careful with yourself</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h03m00s">and I would say that's especially true maybe when you're dealing... when you have kids, and you start dealing with your kids</a>
00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h03m06s">if you know that... what you're capable of, because you're human</a>
00:03:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h03m10s">then that can motivate you to be much more careful with what you say and do</a>
00:03:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h03m15s">and I don't mean cautious, I don't mean timid, I don't mean any of that</a>
00:03:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h03m20s">I just mean that you wanna keep things pristine between you and your children, let's say</a>
00:03:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h03m24s">because that way they're on your good side, and you want them on your good side</a>
00:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h03m29s">because children who get on their parents' bad side suffer very badly for it, and sometimes it's because they're literally abused</a>
00:03:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h03m36s">but more often it's because they get, well they get abused, let's say, or neglected, in  much more subtle ways</a>
00:03:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h03m44s">and you're definitely capable of that, I mean, all you have to do is think about the way you've interacted</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h03m50s">with someone that you've decided to not like, or maybe someone you genuinely don't like</a>
00:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h03m55s">and that can range from just not paying any attention to them, especially if they're doing something good</a>
00:03:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h03m59s">to really pursuing them, and making their life miserable, and you can certainly do that with your family members</a>
00:03:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h04m05s">and you can do that with your intimate partners, and you can do that with your friends, and you can do it with yourself</a>
00:04:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h04m10s">so it's really worth knowing that, so... well...</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h04m16s">the Fox thinks he's a royal rule breaker, but he's really just a two-bit thug, and this is where he learns that</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h04m23s">so... sorry, I have a new phone, and I'm kind of stupid with it, still</a>
00:04:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h04m35s">well, hypothetically that would work, probably won't</a>
00:04:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h04m40s">anyways, the Coachman's got these guys in his grasp now, regardless</a>
00:04:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h04m45s">partly because they're already down this road, and they can't back off, and partly 'cause he also offers them more money than they've seen before</a>
00:04:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h04m52s">so as bad as they are, they're going to get worse... many of you, I presume, have seen Breaking Bad</a>
00:04:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h04m59s">that's a really good example of the incorporation, at least in part, or maybe the possession by the shadow from a Jungian perspective</a>
00:04:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h05m08s">right, because you have this ordinary high school teacher who really thinks that he's an axe [?] and his family as well</a>
00:05:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h05m14s">you know, like your typical persona, roughly speaking, he's just a normal guy</a>
00:05:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h05m19s">but part of the reason that he's a normal guy is 'cause he actually hasn't been put in abnormal circumstances</a>
00:05:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h05m24s">and then all of a sudden he is, and he has a genuine moral conundrum, right, he's gonna die of lung cancer</a>
00:05:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h05m29s">and he has a son who's got a lot of health problems</a>
00:05:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h05m34s">and he's terrified that he's going to leave his wife and his child behind with nothing</a>
00:05:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h05m39s">and then of course as the story... and so he decides to do something that... temporarily... that he regards as... that he would normally regard as reprehensible</a>
00:05:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h05m48s">and of course he just gets tangled up in that, but then, as the story unfolds, you see that there's... it's more complicated</a>
00:05:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h05m54s">because it's not that he was just innocent good guy, and he decided to turn bad, he's also very resentful</a>
00:05:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h06m00s">and angry, and it's partly because he's a bit of a pushover at the beginning, or maybe more than a bit of a pushover</a>
00:06:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h06m05s">and also that he didn't really fulfill his own potential, and that, you know</a>
00:06:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h06m10s">he had friends who walked down the entrepreneurial path and maybe they weren't quite fair to him, but whatever</a>
00:06:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h06m18s">he ends up not very successful as a high school teacher, so he's really angry about that, and so</a>
00:06:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h06m23s">there's more motivation for him opening up the door to the terrible elements of his personality</a>
00:06:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h06m29s">than just the fact that he's got good motivations to do so</a>
00:06:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h06m33s">and that unfolds, so you see the warps and twists in his resentful character</a>
00:06:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h06m39s">increasingly manifest themselves as he walks down this road to, really, total brutality, and it's quite good</a>
00:06:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h06m47s">there's a book called "Ordinary Men" that's a lot like that</a>
00:06:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h06m51s">I don't think I've mentioned that to you before, but "Ordinary Men" is a book about... it's the best book of its type</a>
00:06:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h06m56s">maybe it's the only book of its type... it's possible, but it's plotted much like Breaking Bad in some sense</a>
00:06:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h07m03s">it's a story about these German policemen in the early stages of World War II</a>
00:07:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h07m09s">and they were guys who were old enough to be raised in Germany really before the Hitlerian propaganda came out in full force</a>
00:07:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h07m17s">if you were a teenager, say, in the 1930s, you were gonna be pulled right into the propaganda machine</a>
00:07:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h07m22s">and maybe you were part of the Hitler Youth, like you were raised in that, you know</a>
00:07:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h07m25s">but if you were older, then you were raised before that</a>
00:07:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h07m28s">and you're not as amenable to propaganda once you're older than about, well, I would say, about 22 or  something like that</a>
00:07:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h07m35s">it's pretty young, actually; if you're gonna make a soldier, you have to get a soldier young</a>
00:07:35</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h07m52s">and, you know, it was wartime, and there was this hypothesis in Germany that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h07m58s">the Jews in particular were operating as a fifth column in undermining the German war effort</a>
00:07:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h08m03s">because of course the Germans blamed the Jews and a variety of other people for actually  setting up the conditions that made the war necessary</a>
00:08:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h08m10s">and the police were sent into Poland, they were also required to make peace, roughly speaking</a>
00:08:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h08m17s">they started out by rounding up all the Jewish men between 18 and 65</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h08m23s">and gathering them in stadiums, and then shipping them off on trains, but that isn't where they ended</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h08m28s">they ended in a very, very dark place, I mean these guys were going out in the field with naked pregnant women</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h08m35s">and shooting them in the back of the head by the end of their training</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h08m45s">so this is not one of those examples of people following orders</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h08m50s">and the reason they didn't, roughly speaking, there's many reasons, but one of the reasons they didn't</a>
00:08:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h08m55s">is because they didn't think it was comradely, so to speak, to leave the guys they were working with</a>
00:08:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h09m02s">to do all the dirty work and run off; and that's a really interesting fact</a>
00:09:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h09m07s">because in different circumstances you wouldn't think about that as reprehensible</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h09m12s">you'd think: well, that's part of team work under rough circumstances; and that's at least in part how they viewed it</a>
00:09:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h09m19s">they were also made physically ill multiple times, physically and psychologically ill, by the thing that they had to do</a>
00:09:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h09m25s">but they kept doing them anyways, so one step at a time</a>
00:09:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h09m29s">and that's the thing, is that you end up in very bad place one step at a time, so you better watch those steps</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h09m35s">anyways, Pinokio has now decided, after his latest misadventure, to return to the proper pathway</a>
00:09:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h09m45s">he's off to school again, and he's still pretty naive, although perhaps not as much so as he was before</a>
00:09:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h09m52s">so he decided that he's gonna do things right, he's gonna go get educated, he's going back to school</a>
00:09:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h09m56s">he's gonna take the conventional route to discipline, and be a good boy, roughly speaking</a>
00:09:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h10m01s">and so, he's off to school, and the fox waylays him again</a>
00:10:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h10m06s">this is a really interesting scene, took me quite a long time to unpack this too</a>
00:10:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h10m12s">and so, the fox, first of all, starts out by acting like he's sympathetic again, sympathetic towards Pinocchio</a>
00:10:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h10m20s">and so, he's empathetic, you could say, and... so this is an interesting analysis of empathy</a>
00:10:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h10m26s">so what happens is the fox convinces Pinokio through a variety of maneuvers</a>
00:10:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h10m33s">that he's actually not feeling very well, that he's sick, he really convinces him that he's a victim</a>
00:10:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h10m38s">and one of the things... I had a graduate student named Maya Maja Djikic, who had worked with the UN in  Bosnia</a>
00:10:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h10m47s">and she had toured some of the mass grave sites there, and we wrote a paper one time, called:</a>
00:10:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h10m52s">"You can neither remember nor forget what you don't understand"</a>
00:10:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h10m56s">and it was a paper about the idea, for example, it was partly about the idea that we should never forget the Holocaust</a>
00:10:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h11m03s">and that the idea there is that, well, we should never forget it and we should never repeat it</a>
00:11:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h11m07s">but the thing is, if you don't understand how those things come about, you can't really remember them, right?</a>
00:11:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h11m12s">you think about them as a set of historical facts, but that's not the kind of remembering that actually makes any difference</a>
00:11:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h11m19s">you have to understand the causal pathways, you have to understand how a society would transform in that manner</a>
00:11:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h11m24s">and more importantly, you have to understand the role of the individuals within that society</a>
00:11:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h11m30s">unless you're going to assume that they're so completely unlike you that there's no connection whatsoever</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h11m35s">in which case you haven't remembered it at all, you haven't learned anything at all</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h11m39s">because the right lesson from what happened in the 20th century is: this is what human beings are like</a>
00:11:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h11m45s">that's the correct lesson, and you can say: well, not me; but...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h11m50s">but probably you too, that's the thing, probably</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h12m02s">the Fox convinces Pinocchio that he's sick, he performs a lot of tricks to do this</a>
00:12:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h12m10s">now, you could say that Pinocchio is susceptible to this</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h12m15s">because maybe there's still a part of him that's looking for the easy way out, and so...</a>
00:12:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h12m19s">one of the things that Maja and I found when we were writing this paper</a>
00:12:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h12m23s">we were looking at the discourse that precedes genocide and genocidal states</a>
00:12:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h12m28s">and the enhancement of a sense of victimization on the part of one of the groups</a>
00:12:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h12m32s">usually the group that's going to commit the genocide</a>
00:12:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h12m35s">first of all, their sense of being victims is much heightened by the demagogues</a>
00:12:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h12m41s">who are trying to stir up this sort of hatred, so they basically say: look, you've been oppressed in a variety of ways</a>
00:12:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h12m46s">and these are the people who did it, and they're not gonna stop doing it, and this time we're gonna get them before they get us</a>
00:12:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h12m51s">it's something like that; and so there's something very pathological about the enhancement of victimization</a>
00:12:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h12m58s">which is, well... see the problem as far as I'm concerned with it is, it's not thought through very well</a>
00:12:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h13m12s">because there's a point that's being made, and the point is that people have been oppressed and they suffer</a>
00:13:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h13m20s">and that's true, that point; but then the proper framework from within which to interpret that</a>
00:13:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h13m31s">I believe is that that's characteristic of life, you can't take it personally in some sense</a>
00:13:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h13m38s">and you can't divide the world neatly into perpetrators and victims</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h13m42s">and you certainly can't divide the whole world neatly into perpetrators and victims and then assume that you're only in the victim class</a>
00:13:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h13m48s">and then assume that that gives you certain... like access to certain... forms of redress, let's say</a>
00:13:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h13m55s">it gets dangerous very rapidly if you do that sort of thing, so... For example,</a>
00:13:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h13m59s">one of the things that characterized the Soviet Union - and this was particularly true in the 1920's - but also afterwards</a>
00:13:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h14m04s">the Soviets were very much enamored of the idea of class guilt.</a>
00:14:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h14m12s">So, for example, although it was only about 40 years previously that the serfs had been emancipated, they weren't much more than slaves, right?</a>
00:14:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h14m23s">So that was the bulk of the Russian population. They were bought and sold along with the land.</a>
00:14:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h14m27s">So, they had been emancipated and some of them - many of them - had turned into independent farmers</a>
00:14:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h14m35s">and some of them had become reasonably prosperous, because, at least in principle</a>
00:14:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h14m39s">well, I presume a certain proportion of them from being crooked, but I presume a larger proportion from actually being able to raise food</a>
00:14:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h14m47s">and of course, at that time the bulk of the Russian food population [sic] was produced by</a>
00:14:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h14m52s">these relatively successful peasant farmers; and relatively successful would mean</a>
00:14:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h14m58s">maybe they had a brick house or something, and maybe they had a couple of cows, and maybe they were able to hire a few people</a>
00:14:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h15m04s">so you know, it wasn't like they were massive land owners or anything</a>
00:15:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h15m08s">but I talked to you a little bit about the Pareto principle and the notion that in any domain of activity</a>
00:15:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h15m14s">a small proportion of people end up producing most of what's in that domain of activity</a>
00:15:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h15m19s">the same was true in Russia with regards to these peasant farmers, some of them were extraordinarily efficient</a>
00:15:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h15m25s">and they produced most of Russia's food</a>
00:15:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h15m29s">when the communists came in, they described those land holders as parasites, essentially</a>
00:15:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h15m35s">predicated on the Marxist idea that if someone had extracted profit from an enterprise</a>
00:15:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h15m42s">that the had basically stolen that profit from the people, say, that they had employed or otherwise oppressed</a>
00:15:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h15m49s">so you could be a member of the kulak [spells it out] class</a>
00:15:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h15m57s">and then because you were a member of that class, you were automatically guilty</a>
00:15:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h16m01s">so what happened was... and you gotta think this through to really understand what happened</a>
00:16:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h16m05s">so what happened was the intellectual communists were sent out in cadres out into these little towns</a>
00:16:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h16m12s">to find people who would help them round up the kulaks; now you gotta think about what a small town is like</a>
00:16:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h16m18s">because... so imagine you're in a town, and there's three or four people, or maybe ten people or something like that</a>
00:16:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h16m23s">who are a little more successful than everyone else, and a certain number of people are gonna be fine with that</a>
00:16:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h16m29s">any maybe eve happy about it, because they regard those people as particularly productive</a>
00:16:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h16m33s">and, you know, as stalwart members of the community, regardless of their flaws</a>
00:16:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h16m36s">but there's gonna be some people who are not happy about it at all, that are gonna be very resentful about that and jealous</a>
00:16:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h16m43s">and so those are gonna be people whose characters, I would say, are of the less positive type</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h16m48s">and so when the intellectuals came in and described the reason that these people should be treated as parasites and profiteers</a>
00:16:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h16m55s">then it was the resentful minority in those towns, and that would be the kind of guy that hangs around in the bar all the time</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h17m06s">the intellectuals came in and said: this is unfair that this happened to you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h17m11s">you've actually been victimized and now it's your opportunity to go have your revenge; and that's exactly what happened</a>
00:17:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h17m17s">now, in some of the villages sometimes the peasants would actually surround the farmsteads of these more successful people</a>
00:17:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h17m26s">and try to defend them, but that never worked out for very long</a>
00:17:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h17m30s">so then these mobs, these angry mobs, would go into the farmhouses and strip the place right down to nothing</a>
00:17:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h17m37s">and they packed these people up and sent them on trains with no food, out to Siberia where there was no place to live</a>
00:17:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h17m44s">so they were packed into houses, maybe they had a square meter each to live in</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h18m02s">so what happened then was that there wasn't any food produced</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h18m09s">and so then six million Ukrainians starved to death in the 1920s, it's something you never hear about, right?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h19m00s">how the idea of victimization and perpetration can get out of hand extraordinarily rapidly</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h19m34s">now, the logical part of that is that it is the case that, you know, you can make a very strong case that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h19m40s">every human being is in some sense involved in a tragic enterprise</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h19m46s">right? because you're biologically vulnerable, you're not what you could be as a biological specimen, right?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h20m00s">and then, by the same token, you're also subject to the tyrannical aspect of your culture</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h20m07s">right, 'cause it's forcing you to be a certain way all the time</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h20m12s">socialization does that, you're required to modify your own intrinsic nature in order to come into conformity with the broader community</a>
00:20:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h20m22s">and you can think about that from the Piagetian sense, which is that socialization makes you a more and more sophisticated person</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h20m28s">and there's some truth in that, but you can also be subject just to tyranny, you know</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h20m34s">I see people in my practice, for example, they've had very tyrannical fathers, for example</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h20m40s">sometimes they have tyrannical mothers as well, but they not so much encouraged</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h20m54s">and so it's quite... and that's true of everyone to some degree</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h21m05s">you're not really marked out as an individual in any sense, you know</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h21m17s">which is well represented in the design of this classroom, say</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h21m20s">but by the same token, you know, the university provides you with an identity</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h21m38s">if you compared it to some utopian notion of freedom, but in any real world sense, you're unbelievably well protected  by the university</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h21m45s">partly because it stamps you with the identity "student", which is a respectable identity</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h21m51s">and so you can go off and educate yourself as much as you can</a>
00:21:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h21m55s">and everyone in society says that's okay, they carve out the protected space for you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h21m59s">so at the same time as you're being tyrannized by the institution</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h22m04s">and forced in some ways also to adopt the viewpoints, say, of the professors, depending on the professor</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h22m10s">you're also the beneficiary of that, just like you're the beneficiary of this huge industrial infrastructure</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h22m16s">that underlies everything that you do; so anyways, the  fact that your life is tragic necessarily</a>
00:22:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h22m23s">and that you are subject to oppression makes the victimization story really easy to swallow</a>
00:22:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h22m29s">but then there's a dark side of that, too; and this is actually what happens with Pinokio</a>
00:22:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h22m34s">so, what happens here is that he's told that he's ill</a>
00:22:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h22m39s">and convinced that he's ill, and they do use trickery, and...</a>
00:22:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h22m42s">so again you could look at him in some sense as an innocent victim, but</a>
00:22:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h22m47s">the innocence... the filmmakers do a good job of hedging against the innocent interpretation</a>
00:22:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h22m55s">because what he's offered and accepts because he's ill is an easy way out</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h23m02s">and so what the fox basically tells him is that he needs to have the vacation, because he's sick</a>
00:23:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h23m07s">and he can go off to Pleasure Island, which is this place of impulsivity, roughly speaking</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h23m21s">he's not going to be able to recover his health; and so what Pinokio is offered...</a>
00:23:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h23m26s">is the opportunity to abandon your responsibility as a reward for adopting the guise of victim</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h23m34s">and that's really worth thinking about, because one of the things I thought about for a long time</a>
00:23:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h23m39s">is that... I've been trying to figure out what gives people's lives meaning</a>
00:23:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h23m43s">and tragedy gives life its negative meaning, and nobody disputes that</a>
00:23:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h23m48s">even if you're nihilistic, you're not going to dispute the fact that tragedy gives life negative meaning</a>
00:23:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h23m53s">so when nihilists say that life is meaningless, that isn't exactly what they mean</a>
00:23:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h23m57s">they mean that life is suffering, but there isn't anything transcendent about it that you could set against that suffering</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h24m03s">that's nihilism, it's not that life is meaningless, that would just be neutral</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h24m08s">it's like... no one believes that, they certainly don't act like they believe it</a>
00:24:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h24m15s">if you look at it technically, and we will as we progress through this class</a>
00:24:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h24m20s">in order to have any positive meaning in your life you have to have identified a goal</a>
00:24:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h24m25s">and you have to be working towards it, and there is a technical reason for that</a>
00:24:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h24m29s">and the technical reason, as far as I can tell is that the circuitry that produces the kind of positive emotion that people really like</a>
00:24:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h24m35s">is only activated when you notice that... when you're proceeding towards a goal that you value</a>
00:24:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h24m44s">and so that means that if you don't have a goal that you value, you can't have any positive emotion</a>
00:24:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h24m48s">so technically that's the incentive reward system, and it's... the underlying circuitry is dopaminergic</a>
00:24:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h24m54s">and when that circuitry is activated then it's part of the exploratory circuit, it gives you the sense of being actively engaged in something worthwhile</a>
00:24:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h25m03s">and that's, you know, you tend to think of positive emotion as something produced by reward</a>
00:25:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h25m08s">but there's two kinds of positive emotion, one is the reward that's associated with satiation</a>
00:25:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h25m13s">and that's consummatory reward, and that's the reward you get when you're hungry and you eat</a>
00:25:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h25m18s">but the thing about eating when you're hungry is that it destroys the framework within which you were operating</a>
00:25:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h25m24s">it's time to eat, well, you eat, and that framework's no longer relevant, so the consummatory reward eliminates the value framework</a>
00:25:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h25m31s">and then you're stuck with: well, what are you gonna do next?</a>
00:25:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h25m34s">and so, the consummatory reward has with it its own problems, but the incentive reward is constantly what keeps you moving forward</a>
00:25:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h25m41s">and incentive reward, because it's dopaminergic, also is analgesic</a>
00:25:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h25m45s">literally analgesic; so if you are in pain, you take opiates, and that will cut the pain</a>
00:25:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h25m51s">but so will psychomotor stimulants, like cocaine or amphetamines</a>
00:25:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h25m55s">and so, it's literally the case that if you're engaged in something that's engaging, you're working towards a goal</a>
00:25:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h26m01s">that you're going to feel less pain; and you can see this happening with athletes, you know, they'll break their thumb or something</a>
00:26:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h26m06s">or maybe sometimes even their ankle, and they'll keep playing the game, 'course afterwards they're suffering like mad</a>
00:26:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h26m12s">but the fact that they're so filled with goal-directed enthusiasm means that, well, the pain systems are in some sense shut off</a>
00:26:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h26m20s">so that's an interesting thing, because what it suggests...</a>
00:26:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h26m24s">I mean, then you can imagine... I might say: well, how happy are you that you've made a certain amount of progress?</a>
00:26:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h26m31s">and if you think about it what you'd say is: well, it depends on how much progress and in relationship to what</a>
00:26:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h26m37s">so hypothetically you're gonna be happier if you'd made quite a bit of progress towards a really important goal</a>
00:26:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h26m43s">and then you have to think through what it means for a goal to be really important, 'cause that's not obvious</a>
00:26:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h26m48s">now, you could say: you're in this class, and you're listening to some information</a>
00:26:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h26m53s">and maybe there's two reasons for that: you might find the information interesting per se, but let's forget about that for a minute</a>
00:26:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h27m00s">you need to listen to the information so that you can do well on the assignment, so that you can do well in the class</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h27m07s">you need to do well in your class so that you can finish up your degree</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h27m14s">you need to do that so that you're financially stable and maybe you can start a family and have a life</a>
00:27:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h27m18s">and that's all part of being a good person, something like that</a>
00:27:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h27m22s">and so, that's a hierarchy of goals, and you might say that being a good person would be the thing, however vaguely thought through, that's at the top of that hierarchy</a>
00:27:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h27m32s">and then, when you're doing things that serve that ultimate purpose, then you're gonna find those more meaningful</a>
00:27:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h27m39s">and that meaning is actually produced as a consequence of the engagement of this exploratory circuit</a>
00:27:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h27m44s">that's nested right down in your hypothalamus, it's really, really, old</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h27m59s">well, it isn't only from a hedonic point of view, you know, it's a matter of being happy</a>
00:27:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h28m05s">it's the wrong way of thinking about it, it's much more complicated than that, it's... yes?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h28m09s">[student] I was actually just about to ask like a hedonic element, 'cause I'm just trying to understand</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h28m15s">[student] this... I guess... not relationship but the differentiation between hedonism and satiation</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h28m30s">[student] but hedonism isn't exactly... like it's not satiation, because</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h28m48s">[student] so I was trying to understand...</a>
00:28:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h28m51s">well, what I would say, we're going to into that A LOT once we're done with this, like a lot</a>
00:28:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h28m57s">but I'll go over it briefly, I mean, it's not merely hedonism</a>
00:28:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h29m01s">because there's an analgesic and also a fear-reducing element to pursuing a proper path</a>
00:29:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h29m08s">right, so there's control of negative emotion, but there's not just control of negative emotion and generation of positive emotion in the immediate future</a>
00:29:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h29m14s">which is kinda what you think about with regards to hedonism; actually, Pinokio takes a hedonic route next</a>
00:29:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h29m20s">the problem with the hedonic route is that... so the pursuit of pure happiness, let's say</a>
00:29:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h29m25s">is that what makes you happy in the next minute might not be something that will make you happy in the next hour</a>
00:29:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h29m31s">well you know that, there's this comic, what's his name, they call him king of the one-liners</a>
00:29:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h29m36s">he talked about drinking wine; don't you know that's gonna cause a hangover?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h29m40s">and he said: yeah, at the end, but the beginning and middle are excellent</a>
00:29:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h29m45s">and so that's really the problem with hedonism, right, is that</a>
00:29:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h29m49s">to pursue something that makes you happy in the immediate present</a>
00:29:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h29m53s">risks sacrificing your, well, many things, but at least, let's say, your hedonism in the medium to long term</a>
00:29:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h30m00s">and of course that is one of the major problems with drug use, and alcohol's a really good example of that</a>
00:30:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h30m05s">because whatever hedonic kick you might get from it that moment at night</a>
00:30:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h30m10s">you're going to pay for almost completely or maybe even more so, because the next day you're</a>
00:30:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h30m17s">much more jittery and anxious, and that's a direct consequence of withdrawing from the drug</a>
00:30:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h30m22s">so when you're in... when you have a hangover you're in alcohol withdrawal</a>
00:30:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h30m26s">so that's how fast you get, roughly speaking, addicted to it</a>
00:30:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h30m31s">and so if you take another drink when you're hungover it'll cure it, but it's not a very useful cure</a>
00:30:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h30m36s">because all you do is push the inevitable hangover one more step into the future</a>
00:30:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h30m40s">and so part of the problem with the hedonic answer is: happy when?</a>
00:30:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h30m45s">exatly; and over what period of time? and also: who's happy?</a>
00:30:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h30m49s">because maybe something makes you happy but makes your family miserable</a>
00:30:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h30m52s">now, you could say, well, I don't care, but you do care if you have to live with your family</a>
00:30:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h30m56s">because they're gonna take it out on you; so the impulsive hedonism, which is also fostered, say, by a positive emotion</a>
00:30:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h31m05s">it tends to put people into a state of... the pursuit of short-term hedonism, it's not a good medium to long-term solution</a>
00:31:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h31m13s">I actually think that's why people evolved conscientiousness</a>
00:31:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h31m17s">right, 'cause conscientiousness is not happy, conscientious people aren't conscientious because it makes them happy</a>
00:31:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h31m24s">we're starting to think that they're conscientious because they actually feel terrible if they're just sitting around doing nothing</a>
00:31:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h31m31s">and so it's a way of staving off stress that's related to enforced leisure, something like that</a>
00:31:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h31m38s">you know, if you know industrious people, some of you are industrious</a>
00:31:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h31m43s">some of you will have industrious parents, they just can't sit around and do nothing, they have to be working</a>
00:31:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h31m47s">they don't feel good unless they're working; so one thing about conscientiousness is that</a>
00:31:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h31m53s">it involves continual sacrifice, right, you're doing difficult things in the present, hypothetically to make the future better</a>
00:31:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h31m59s">but that's not driven by hedonism by any stretch of the imagination; and conscientiousness is actually a pretty good predictor of long-term life success</a>
00:31:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h32m06s">in stable societies; 'cause there's also no point in being conscientious and saving things up</a>
00:32:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h32m12s">and storing things if a bunch of thugs are gonna just come in randomly and take it all away</a>
00:32:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h32m18s">so conscientiousness actually only works intelligently in societies that have some medium to long-term stability</a>
00:32:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h32m23s">you know, 'cause you can get wiped out by hyperinflation, too, 'cause hyperinflation kills off the conscientious people</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h32m29s">the people who accrued debts are thrilled when hyperinflation kicks in, because it wipes out their debts</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h32m34s">but of course those debts are the things they owed to people who were conscientious enough to save</a>
00:32:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h32m39s">so anyways, Pinocchio is transformed into a victim, and he's offered this identity, and he takes it</a>
00:32:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h32m47s">now, it's partly 'cause he's deceived and manipulated</a>
00:32:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h32m50s">but it's also partly because the Fox offers him the abandonment of responsibility as payment for adopting the victim identity</a>
00:32:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h33m01s">so this is where his own lack of morality, let's say, 'cause this is all about Pinocchio's development as a character</a>
00:33:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h33m08s">plays a role in his demise</a>
00:33:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h33m13s">if I'm a victim, everyone else owes me something, and I don't have to take any responsibility</a>
00:33:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h33m18s">and so, one of the things I've wondered... here's something to think about:</a>
00:33:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h33m22s">it might be that the sense of meaning that life can provide to you is proportionate to the amount of responsibility you decide to take on</a>
00:33:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h33m31s">and that'd be very strange if it was the case, you know, because responsibility of course is a kind of weight, obviously</a>
00:33:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h33m36s">and it's difficult to take on responsibility; but if any positive emotion that you feel and your control of anxiety</a>
00:33:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h33m45s">and the control over pain is dependent on the activation of the systems that watch you move towards a desired goal</a>
00:33:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h33m53s">then the more complete and weighty the goal is, the more kick there's going to be in the observation that you're moving towards it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h34m01s">and you know, you kinda already know this, because you'll have observed in your own life</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h34m23s">so even though it's difficult, you get engaged in it, you can remember it better, you process it better</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h34m34s">you can get into it; and it would be very interesting if that was proportionate to the degree of responsibility</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h34m40s">that you're willing to shoulder, and I think you can make a strong case for that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h34m43s">I've also often wondered: imagine you could offer people a choice</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h34m48s">here's the choice: you can say, well, your life isn't meaningful, the nihilists have got it right</a>
00:34:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h34m54s">there's no meaning in your life, and because of that there's no reason for you to accept any responsibility</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h35m00s">so you can live a responsibility-free life and maybe one of impulsive pleasure-seeking</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h35m06s">but a responsibility-free life; but the price you pay is that it doesn't get to be meaningful</a>
00:35:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h35m11s">or you could say to someone: no, we're gonna do the opposite, we're gonna say: you can live a meaningful life</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h35m16s">but it's only gonna be as meaningful as the amount of responsibility that you're willing to bear</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h35m22s">and then you might say: well, what would people choose? 'cause everybody always makes noises about wanting to have a meaningful life</a>
00:35:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h35m30s">but if the price you pay for that is the adoption of responsibility, then it's not so obvious people would choose meaning over pointless pursuits</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h35m41s">if they had to... if the benefit they got for choosing the pointless pursuits was that they didn't have to care about anything they ever did</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h35m48s">there's no responsibility, and that's really what Pinocchio is offered, and that's what the Coachman offers him</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h35m53s">and that's interesting, because, you know, so far it's been the Fox and the Cat, and they're kinda two-bit hoods</a>
00:35:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h36m01s">and so, the pathological pathway that they offer Pinocchio is not the worst of the pathological pathways</a>
00:36:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h36m08s">but here, at least as far as the imagination, the collective imagination that created this movie is concerned</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h36m13s">this is where you get to the most pathological form of, let's call it temptation</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h36m30s">so here's the Fox, pretending to be a doctor investigating Pinocchio's illness</a>
00:36:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h36m37s">and he makes some notes, which is all just meaningless scribble</a>
00:36:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h36m44s">it's like white noise, and it doesn't matter that the arguments that he's making  are completely incoherent</a>
00:36:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h36m51s">and it doesn't matter that he actually doesn't know anything, what he's selling is easy to buy</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h36m56s">and so Pinocchio buys it</a>
00:36:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h37m01s">and by the end of the conversation with the Fox he's pretty convinced that he's useless</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h37m06s">and that he needs a vacation; you know...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h37m20s">let's imagine that you have a child that is a little on the neurotic side, so high negative emotion</a>
00:37:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h37m25s">and maybe one that's also a little bit on the sickly side, so it has a variety of relatively minor ailments, but ailments nonetheless</a>
00:37:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h37m35s">and so what that means as a parent, we'll say mother for this example, 'cause I want to use the oedipal example</a>
00:37:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h37m42s">you have to make a decision all the time about exactly how you're gonna treat that child</a>
00:37:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h37m46s">one decision is: well, I'm not gonna... you don't have to go to school today, because you're not feeling well, but</a>
00:37:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h37m54s">fair enough, but do you make the same decision the next day? and do you make the same decision the next day?</a>
00:37:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h38m02s">and let's imagine that you enable the child to avoid responsibility as a consequence of capitalizing on their illness</a>
00:38:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h38m10s">well then that's not gonna be very good for the child, the rule with a sickly child has to be something like:</a>
00:38:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h38m15s">I'm gonna push you right to your limit; because otherwise how is the person gonna figure out what they can do?</a>
00:38:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h38m22s">and if they can't figure out what they can do, then they're not gonna be able to make their way in the world at all</a>
00:38:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h38m27s">and then that gets muddied very badly if you're not exactly sure that you want them to make their way in the world, you know</a>
00:38:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h38m33s">maybe you're just as happy, because you'd be sitting at home, alone if your child was there with you</a>
00:38:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h38m38s">and maybe you'd be just as happy at some level if they never grew up at all</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h38m42s">because then they won't leave; and maybe that's because you have a terrible marriage, and you're lonesome, you know</a>
00:38:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h38m49s">maybe it's an abusive marriage and your husband has chased away all your friends</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h38m53s">and so you don't have anything at all, and maybe that's 'cause you didn't stand up for yourself very well</a>
00:38:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h38m57s">apart from the fact that he was, you know, tyrannical in his central nature</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h39m02s">and so then all those little warps and bends in your psyche are gonna manifest themselves right...</a>
00:39:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h39m09s">right in the background of every one of those decisions</a>
00:39:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h39m14s">my daughter had a lot of illnesses when she was adolescent, and they were very serious, and</a>
00:39:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h39m20s">it was very difficult to figure out what to do about that, because you couldn't exactly apply normative rules, right?</a>
00:39:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h39m27s">and we always had to figure out if she was communicating her symptoms to us, how seriously to take those</a>
00:39:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h39m35s">and the answer was: the least amount of serious possible, it's something like that, because</a>
00:39:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h39m42s">we needed to know, and she needed to know, what she could do in spite of the fact that she  had problems</a>
00:39:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h39m47s">and one of the things I really tried to instill in her, and I think it worked, is that:</a>
00:39:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h39m53s">you don't ever wanna use your illness as an excuse for not doing anything</a>
00:39:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h39m58s">not consciously, you know, sometimes you might not know, "I'm not feeling well, what can I do?"</a>
00:39:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h40m02s">well you don't know, right, because sometimes when you're not feeling well, you can do more than you think, and sometimes you can do less than you think</a>
00:40:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h40m08s">it's not like it's obvious, but sometimes it's obvious, you know, this little temptation flits through your mind, and you think:</a>
00:40:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h40m14s">well, I don't really wanna do what I'm doing today, and I'm not feeling very well, so I don't have to do it</a>
00:40:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h40m18s">you do that a hundred times, and <em>you</em> don't know how sick you are anymore</a>
00:40:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h40m22s">and then you're in real trouble, because not only are you sick, but you actually have... you've muddied the waters</a>
00:40:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h40m29s">and so you have both problems, is you're actually ill, and you've  betrayed yourself</a>
00:40:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h40m36s">by using that as an excuse not to pursue your responsibilities</a>
00:40:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h40m40s">and that, I think, if both of those thing happen to you at the same time, you're in real trouble</a>
00:40:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h40m45s">and it's really hard not to have that happen</a>
00:40:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h40m49s">so anyways, Pinokio gets enticed into believing he's a victim</a>
00:40:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h40m54s">the fact that he's insufficient is used as an excuse by the fox and the cat to offer him a trip to Pleasure Island</a>
00:40:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h41m04s">and this is, I think, where the movie gets particularly dark</a>
00:41:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h41m07s">and so off they go, singing away; they have to carry him</a>
00:41:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h41m11s">so you could say in some sense he's carried by societal pathology and his own trouble</a>
00:41:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h41m18s">he's carried like a puppet off to Pleasure Island; and so the Cricket...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h41m24s">the Cricket is again left behind, he's not the world's best conscience at this point</a>
00:41:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h41m29s">so, Pinokio goes off to meet the Coachman, and the Coachman has already said he's collecting bad little boys</a>
00:41:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h41m36s">and he's got them on the coach, they're all delinquent types here</a>
00:41:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h41m41s">and the ticket on the coach was the ace of spades, which is what Pinocchio is holding</a>
00:41:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h41m46s">and he's with this character here, called Lampwick</a>
00:41:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h41m51s">and that's an interesting name, so he's the thing that burns in the middle of a light, lamp wick</a>
00:41:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h41m56s">and that's interesting, because it's a play on Lucifer, 'cause Lucifer means 'bringer of light'</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h42m02s">and so Lampwick is a play on that, and Lampwick is really a nasty piece of work</a>
00:42:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h42m07s">he's got this false arrogance about him, he's got this cynical voice, really deeply cynical voice</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h42m13s">and he's only... I don't know how old he's supposed to be in this, maybe 12 or something like that, 13</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h42m18s">And so he's one of those kids who's become prematurely cynical</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h42m22s">I'll tell you a story about that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h42m26s">so I used to live in Montreal, I lived in a poor neighborhood</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h42m45s">not good partying, a lot of bikers were hanging around there, ans I knew there was a little kid that lived there as well</a>
00:42:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h42m51s">anyways, I was out there in the back alley, pounding away on my fence, and these little kids came up</a>
00:42:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h42m56s">and they were little, they were like 3 and 4 years old, hey, and they spoke joual</a>
00:42:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h43m02s">a kind of really heavily accented quebecois french, and my french isn't good</a>
00:43:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h43m07s">so I could hardly understand them; but they were watching me hammer, and they got a little closer</a>
00:43:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h43m13s">and they had one kid who was clearly the leader, had a real scowl on his face, eh?</a>
00:43:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h43m17s">and so they were watching, and I kinda motioned to one of them, that they could use the hammer</a>
00:43:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h43m22s">and that kid said, and I'm gonna mangle this, but he said "je voulai" or something like that</a>
00:43:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h43m27s">and what it meant is "I'll steal that"; and so I thought... you know, and then he came over and he tugged on it</a>
00:43:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h43m33s">and he wanted to take it, and he was quite angry that I wasn't gonna let him take it, and then so...</a>
00:43:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h43m38s">so I couldn't engage him, I couldn't get him to play, you know, and his buddies were sort of hanging around behind him, and</a>
00:43:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h43m44s">they wouldn't come and play, because he wouldn't, and so he was hostile right away to me</a>
00:43:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h43m49s">and then... so the fence piece was laying out in the alley, and these little monsters started running across it</a>
00:43:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h43m58s">which I thought was really remarkable, you know, but it was terrible at the same time, because they were really little kids</a>
00:43:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h44m04s">that shouldn't be happening when you're like 3 or 4; if that's happening at that age, things are not good</a>
00:44:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h44m09s">and so that kid was already like seriously not happy with the world</a>
00:44:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h44m15s">and you know, I've been studying antisocial behavior for a long time by that point, and I knew that</a>
00:44:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h44m20s">the kids who are destined to jail later in their lives are kids who are rough and tough when they're two years old, but then don't get socialized</a>
00:44:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h44m28s">or maybe worse, they get anti-socialized, which is exactly what happened to this kid, he'd obviously been ignored and abused</a>
00:44:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h44m35s">certainly no one had ever played with him in any real way, because he wouldn't play; and it's not good if a kid is that little</a>
00:44:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h44m43s">and you can't get them to play, something's gone seriously wrong, 'cause they're so playful at that age, that it's like 90% of them</a>
00:44:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h44m50s">anyways, so they were running back and forth on this fence, I thought, stomping on it, you know</a>
00:44:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h44m54s">and I was right there, I thought, well, first of all I thought that was remarkable, but I also thought it was absolutely horrifying, because</a>
00:44:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h45m02s">you know, in some sense I could see where this kid was headed and why</a>
00:45:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h45m06s">at that early stage in his life, it's really... it's not a pleasant thing to behold</a>
00:45:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h45m12s">but there was nothing that could be done about it, and that... kinda what this Lampwick is like</a>
00:45:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h45m16s">he's prematurely cynical, this kid was already cynical, and he was like 4 years old</a>
00:45:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h45m20s">you know, most kids don't get cynical 'till they're teenagers, and then often they don't get completely cynical and usually they more or less grow out of it</a>
00:45:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h45m29s">but it happened to him much earlier; so this Lampwick character, he's already decided that</a>
00:45:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h45m35s">he knows everything, that everyone else's opinion is worth nothing</a>
00:45:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h45m40s">and that there's nothing in cultre or society that holds any utility whatsoever for someone like him</a>
00:45:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h45m46s">now, you can imagine developing that way, if you were raised in a family where people were generally lying to you</a>
00:45:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h45m54s">and that they randomly treated you or neglected you, and that you couldn't discern anything about them that was admirable or positive</a>
00:45:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h46m01s">of course you assume the whole structure is corrupt, and that you had to take care of yourself, and no one else</a>
00:46:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h46m09s">well, not of course, not everyone assumes that under those situations, I shouldn't say "of course"</a>
00:46:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h46m14s">but it's a logical set of conclusions, so...</a>
00:46:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h46m19s">and of course it's proportionate to some degree to how much abuse you tak, althought there are lots of stories of people who've been terribly abused as children</a>
00:46:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h46m26s">who grew up to be, you know, kind, remarkable, responsible, thoughtful</a>
00:46:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h46m33s">people who were absolutely opposed to abuse, instead of propagating it</a>
00:46:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h46m37s">there's no direct causal pathway</a>
00:46:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h46m40s">anyways, Lampwick is pretty happy to be on this coach way to Pleasure Island which he's heard about</a>
00:46:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h46m47s">he said, "well, it's all you can eat, all you can smoke, you don't have to do any work, you can do anything you want"</a>
00:46:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h46m54s">so you might say, well, it's too good to be true, like the ginger bread house in the Hansel and Grettel story</a>
00:46:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h47m00s">right, the kids are lost, there's a ginger bread house, it's a house, which is something they need, and it's made out of cookies</a>
00:47:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h47m07s">it looks like it's a little bit too good to be true, and of course in the house there's the negative part of that</a>
00:47:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h47m13s">which is the old witch who wants to eat children; and that's a story about what happens to people if they're offered more than they should be offered</a>
00:47:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h47m24s">so... anyways, Lampwick is firing off... he has a little slingshot</a>
00:47:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h47m32s">and he's firing off pebbles at the horses who are pulling the carriage, and that's just the kind of guy that he is</a>
00:47:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h47m39s">so he takes Pinocchio under his wing; and the Cricket is down there in the dust, he's caught back up to the carriage</a>
00:47:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h47m46s">but he's having a rough time at this point</a>
00:47:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h47m50s">this is also a story, to some degree, about transitioning to adolescence</a>
00:47:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h47m54s">you know, because adolescence is a time when people are pretty impulsive, and their view is quite short-term</a>
00:47:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h47m59s">and are more likely to pursue immediate pleasures and all of that, and that can get really out of hand, so...</a>
00:47:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h48m06s">anyways, they separate from the mainland, and go on a boat, and so they're off to Pleasure Island</a>
00:48:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h48m13s">a dark place; and the Coachman opens the gates and lets the delinquents into Pleasure Island, and</a>
00:48:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h48m24s">they basically have a riot; and this is Pleasure Island, here, it's full of amusement park rides, and</a>
00:48:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h48m35s">you know, one of the things that's kind of interesting about horror movies, I'm sure you've noticed this, is that they're often set in amusement parks</a>
00:48:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h48m42s">and clowns are often characters of horror, we'll leave the clowns aside for now, but the amusement park thing, that's pretty interesting</a>
00:48:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h48m50s">why in the world would an amusement park be a place of horror?</a>
00:48:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h48m55s">and the first question might be: well, have you ever been to an amusement park? because there is something about them, that's really...</a>
00:48:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h49m02s">they have a dark side, a clear dark side, and part of it is that</a>
00:49:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h49m08s">people with nothing better to do are spending money stupidly, and they're being fleeced by the people who operate the amusement park</a>
00:49:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h49m16s">you know, and they have, let's say, a stereotypically dark reputation</a>
00:49:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h49m22s">and they're moving around all the time, this is also something that psychopaths do</a>
00:49:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h49m27s">and all they're doing is moving from community to community, and taking the money from the rubes, fundamentally</a>
00:49:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h49m32s">and so, the amusement park, well...</a>
00:49:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h49m37s">if you walk through an amusement park with that sort of thing in mind, maybe that's also coloring your vision, of course, but</a>
00:49:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h49m45s">it's something that you could see very immediately; so there's something about them that's deeply sad, but there's also an underlying horror that characterizes them</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h49m53s">it's easy for a horror movie or horror novel writers to immediately expand upon, there's something about it that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h51m54s">and he was tall, he was a bout six foot seven, and he was pretty thin</a>
00:51:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h51m59s">and we used to go out to the bar now and then, and in many of the bars that we were in, we lived in this little town</a>
00:51:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h52m06s">there were bullies, and these were guys... and I worked in the bars, and I used to watch these guys, and they'd basically...</a>
00:52:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h52m12s">there was a handful of them in town, pretty psychopathic types</a>
00:52:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h52m15s">and they'd go to the bar, and all they'd do is sit there and wait for someone to come in who they could beat up</a>
00:52:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h52m20s">they knew who it was as soon as they walked in, that's actually why they were at the bar</a>
00:52:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h52m24s">and so they'd wait 'till someone came in, who didn't look very confident, and who could likely be intimidated by this sort of thing, and then they'd</a>
00:52:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h52m32s">tell him to come outside for a fight, and if they didn't, well then they'd of course make fun of him, and if they did, well, generally they'd beat them up</a>
00:52:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h52m39s">my friend kinda caught on to this trick, and he started going into bars, and every time that someone like that came near him</a>
00:52:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h52m46s">he'd go outside and fight with them; and one of the things he observed right away is that</a>
00:52:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h52m50s">almost inevitably when he went outside with them, they'd shake hands and make friends</a>
00:52:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h52m55s">so as soon as he... and it was realy remarkable, watching him, 'cause he wasn't a particularly physically powerful person</a>
00:52:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h53m01s">although he was extraordinarily tall; but he had started to play this game, and he did it for  along time, and</a>
00:53:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h53m07s">I don't remember him ever actually having to fight, he just stared them down, fundamentally</a>
00:53:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h53m14s">so it was a very interesting thing to watch, but it was an indication to me of exactly how shallow this kind of bravado, bullying actually is</a>
00:53:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h53m23s">but people don't find that out, because they won't stand up, and it's not surprising, but...</a>
00:53:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h53m32s">anyways, they load up on food, Pinocchio's carrying a pie and a an ice cream cone simultaneously</a>
00:53:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h53m38s">and then they're off to have a fight, and Lampwick says something like:</a>
00:53:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h53m44s">it's good to punch someone in the nose sometimes just for the, I think he says, heck of it</a>
00:53:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h53m48s">and so Pinokio adopts this strut, and in they go to the roughhouse</a>
00:53:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h53m52s">and then, in the next scene, you see this model home up for destruction, it's quite an interesting scene symbolically, you see...</a>
00:53:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h54m01s">in the middle of this house here there's a stained-glass window that has a mandala on it, we'll see it more clearly in a minute</a>
00:54:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h54m08s">and a mandala is a sacred symbol of the Self, that's the Jungian interpretation</a>
00:54:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h54m14s">it's a symbol... it's very difficult to describe, but it's a symbol...</a>
00:54:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h54m18s">music is a mandala, except it's  played out across time, so you could say that thing is the same as music, but it's kinda like a slice of music</a>
00:54:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h54m26s">it's the same idea, you know sometimes you see those slow-motion or sped-up-motion videos of a flower unfolding?</a>
00:54:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h54m34s">that's the same idea, you can imagine that being se to music, and somehow that would make sense</a>
00:54:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h54m40s">and the mandala's like a symbol of the unfolding of being, or the source of meaning, or something like that</a>
00:54:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h54m47s">and it's also a symbol of the Self from the jungian perspective</a>
00:54:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h54m52s">so there you see it more clearly; the kids are starting to burn this place</a>
00:54:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h54m57s">and trash it, and they're dragging the grand piano down the stairs, it's a destruction of high culture</a>
00:54:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h55m03s">about which they are nothing but cynical, 'cause they don't believe that hard work and sacrifice can</a>
00:55:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h55m08s">can produce something of any value, and they want to bring it down and destroy it, and that's partly because...</a>
00:55:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h55m16s">you can see this in the story of Cain and Able</a>
00:55:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h55m20s">Able is hardworking and everyone likes him, and he makes the proper sacrifices, and so his life goes pretty well</a>
00:55:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h55m25s">and that's part of the reason Cain hates it, and he's jealous and resentful, but worse than that</a>
00:55:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h55m31s">if you're around someone, if you're not doing very well, especially if that's your own fault</a>
00:55:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h55m36s">if you're not doing very well, and you're around someone who's doing very well, it's very painful, because</a>
00:55:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h55m40s">the mere fact of their being judges you, and so it's very easy to wanna destroy that</a>
00:55:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h55m46s">to destroy that ideal so that you don't have to live with the terrible consequences of seeing it embodied in front of you</a>
00:55:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h55m55s">and so part of the reason that people wanna tear things down is so that they don't have anything to contrast themselves against and to feel bad</a>
00:55:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h56m02s">and that's exactly what's happening here, the kids are destroying all of this culture, roughly speaking</a>
00:56:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h56m11s">because it judges them; the fact that it exists judges them; and I've often thought this about Michelangelo's statue of David</a>
00:56:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h56m19s">which is this heroic... so David was a shepherd, obviously, and it doesn't sound like much, but</a>
00:56:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h56m25s">back in those times being a shepherd was a big deal, because there were lions, and you had a slingshot</a>
00:56:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h56m30s">so like, you've got to defend your sheep from lions with a slingshot</a>
00:56:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h56m35s">so you weren't exactly this, like, 19th century English guy dressed in a, you know, frilly blue suit</a>
00:56:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h56m41s">you were tough as a bloody... well, someone who would go after a lion with a slingshot, it's no joke</a>
00:56:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h56m48s">anyways, the statue is very heroic, and, you know, you look at that, you think, well, that's the possibility of human kind</a>
00:56:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h56m54s">but by the same token it's also what you're not, and so, as well as being an ideal, it's a judge</a>
00:56:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h56m59s">and every ideal is a judge, so... yes?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h57m02s">[student] going back to your example of Cain and Able, um, so you're using that as an example illustrating</a>
00:57:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h57m10s">[student] becoming bitter as a result of not being able to achieve status... success as a result of hard work</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h57m22s">[student] but in the example of Cain and Able, um, like one was a shepherd, and one was a farmer, and the one who was favored</a>
00:57:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h57m34s">[student] so was that a result of the hard work or was that a result of... (agriculture being favored?)</a>
00:57:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h57m39s">good question, those stories are very compicated</a>
00:57:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h57m45s">and the story is very ambivalent about whether Cain is not rewarded because he makes bad sacrifices</a>
00:57:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h57m51s">or beause God's just in a bad mood; I like that... if you read the story</a>
00:57:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h57m56s">I read multiple translations of the story, and when Cain comes to God to complain</a>
00:57:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h58m02s">God basically tells him: look, buddy, before you go about criticizing the structure of reality</a>
00:58:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h58m09s">you should look to your own inadequacies; he says: sin crouches at your door like a predatory, sexually aroused animal</a>
00:58:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h58m16s">and you invited it in to have its way with you, and something has emerged as a consequence</a>
00:58:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h58m21s">so don't be botherin' me about my creation before you look to yourself</a>
00:58:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h58m26s">so there's a very strong hint that the reason that God has not favored Cain's sacrifices because they weren't of particularly good quality</a>
00:58:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h58m35s">but it is ambivalent in the story, and there is the sheperd versus farmer motif as well</a>
00:58:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h58m41s">and of course that motif runs through the entire corpus of stories to some degree, especially the shepherd motif</a>
00:58:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h58m47s">so, it's only about a paragraph long, that whole story and it packs all that into that tiny little amount of space</a>
00:58:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h58m53s">but the idea that Cain kills Abel to get rid of his ideal</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h59m16s">anyways, so these kids are just tearing down this model home</a>
00:59:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h59m20s">tearing down western civilization, I suppose is another way of looking at it, or just tearing down civilization, period</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h59m26s">and Pinokio's having a pretty good time, he's got his axe, and he's looking a little malevolent there</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h59m31s">and happy to be destroying things, which is of course a pretty simple thing to do</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h59m36s">so there's that image that I told you about, the mandala, and that's a flower in this image</a>
00:59:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h59m42s">and so, what happens is that, I think it's Lampwick, throws a brick through it</a>
00:59:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h59m47s">and so, what that means symbolically: the self is a symbol of your potential, among very many other things</a>
00:59:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=00h59m54s">but by engaging in this sort of impulsive, destructive activity Lampwick and Pinocchio are making it impossible to further their development</a>
00:59:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h00m03s">and they're doing that to some degree consciously, they basically say: to hell with it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h00m07s">and toss a brick through this highest ideal, the thing through which light shines, so also that harkens back to the star as well</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h01m28s">is to think about what totalitarian states have to offer their populace, and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h02m28s">you can see in the forefront there's some cards for gambling, so he's engaged in these sort of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h04m53s">which is some foreshadowing, and the Cricket gets all upset, puts his coat on backwards</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h05m10s">and so Pinocchio is left without the guidance of conscience, and the Cricket is trying to figure out how to get off Pleasure Island</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h05m17s">BUT! he goes through the gates and he sees what's actually going on</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h05m59s">you can see one of those black-suited horrors here, hauling donkeys out of this crate</a>
01:05:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h06m05s">and one of them has a hat on, and they look very sad</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h06m09s">and they're in different crates, and one of them says: sold to the salt mines, and one of them says: sold to the circus</a>
01:06:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h06m14s">so they're shipped off to be slaves, roughly speaking</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h06m19s">and they look very sad, and then one of them gets hauled out of a crate, and he's still got a hat on</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h06m24s">he has a hat on and a sweater, and he can still talk, he's a boy, it turns out</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h06m29s">that's been half-transformed into a jackass, a brying jackass prior to being enslaved</a>
01:06:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h06m35s">so that's another thing that's quite interesting about the story, you know, it also makes the case that if you</a>
01:06:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h06m42s">replace your voice with stupid braying, that the probability that you're going to become enslaved by a tyrant is extraordinarily high</a>
01:06:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h06m50s">and I always can't help but think about ideologues in that manner, you know</a>
01:06:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h06m57s">Solzhenitsyn wrote about the radical left ideologues that got thrown in the gulag archipelago, you know</a>
01:06:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h07m02s">so they were part stalwarts, this happened to a lot of people, true believers</a>
01:07:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h07m06s">who were vacuumed up by the stalinist machine and thrown into the gulag anyways, and</a>
01:07:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h07m12s">he said that those people suffered in some ways more than everyone else, because</a>
01:07:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h07m16s">what did he say? they were  bit by the beloved hand that fed them</a>
01:07:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h07m20s">and so the first while when they were in the camps, Solzhenitsyn didn't really know what to do with people like that</a>
01:07:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h07m24s">because on the one hand, well, they were in the camps, and wasn't that awful, and they've been torn away from their family</a>
01:07:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h07m29s">and you know, stripped of all their identity, and their status, so that's pretty rough</a>
01:07:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h07m34s">but on the other hand they were writing letters protesting their innocence</a>
01:07:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h07m38s">and assuming that everyone else in the camp was guilty, but they were innocent, and they were still strident believers in the communist process</a>
01:07:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h07m46s">and so, you know, it was a conundrum, here they are being terribly punished</a>
01:07:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h07m51s">but by the same token they're also the perpetrators of their own demise, so how do you deal with them?</a>
01:07:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h07m56s">they used to play "comrades", he said they used to play "comrades" with people like that</a>
01:07:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h08m00s">and invite them into an ideological discussion about the camp situation, and the situation in the country as a whole</a>
01:08:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h08m08s">and let them rattle out their ideological justifications for everything that had happened</a>
01:08:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h08m14s">trying to make them parody themselves, roughly speaking, it was a rough game</a>
01:08:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h08m19s">and Solzhenitsyn also concluded that there was no helping someone like that</a>
01:08:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h08m28s">when they were still ensconced inside that braying ideology, you could predict everything they were going to say</a>
01:08:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h08m34s">it's like someone had a crank, you could just crank it, and out would come the proper ideological formulas</a>
01:08:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h08m39s">but then he realized that as soon as they, let's call it, repented of that</a>
01:08:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h08m44s">and started to realize they're own role in it or the error of the system</a>
01:08:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h08m48s">then he would start communicating with them, you know, as if they were people who you could communicate with</a>
01:08:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h08m57s">yeah, that was very interesting, as far as I'm concerned</a>
01:08:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h08m59s">anyways, this kid is still a little bit human, he starts to cry for his mom</a>
01:08:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h09m05s">and the Coachman basically throws him back into the crate and says that he's not ready yet</a>
01:09:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h09m09s">and the reason for that is that he could still... he still had the power of independent speech</a>
01:09:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h09m14s">you remember, right at the beginning of the movie, when the mouth was painted on Pionokio</a>
01:09:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h09m19s">we saw that mask that was really glaring at the process, I said that character recurrs continuously throughout the movie</a>
01:09:19</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h13m47s">and so, the idea there is that, well, the kingdom is solid ground</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h14m10s">that isn't what happens, they escape from the tyranny, they actually end up somewhere arguably worse</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h14m22s">when you go from a bad place to a better place you go to a worse place first</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h14m31s">because it also tells you why you might be unwilling to take the next step</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h15m27s">alright, so</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h15m37s">Carl Jung talked about this phenomenon he...</a>
01:15:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h15m45s">he described as retrogressive restoration of the persona</a>
01:15:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h15m52s">and so, it's a complicated idea, but basically what it means is that sometimes you take a leap forward</a>
01:15:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h15m59s">and you learn some things, but you can't catalyze a new identity, so you try to go back and hide in your old identity</a>
01:15:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h16m05s">and that actually doesn't work, because, well, things have changed, and you've learned something, and that isn't who you are anymore</a>
01:16:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h16m14s">and so it's like you have to cut parts of yourself off in a destructive manner to fit back into the person that you were</a>
01:16:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h16m21s">now, what happens here is that Pinokio escapes from this tyrannical situation</a>
01:16:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h16m28s">and undergoes this descent into chaos, but he tries to go back home, he tries to go back to what he was</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h16m42s">so when he goes home he finds that there's no home there, now</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h17m07s">why would someone do that, because it means they subject to the tyrannical judgment of their father</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h17m31s">here's a weird little exercise that you can undertake, a little thought experiment</a>
01:17:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h17m37s">so you have your parents and of course your parents have friends who are about their age, and</a>
01:17:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h17m42s">maybe some of them are people you only know peripherally, and I might ask you, well</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h17m48s">do you care more about what your parents think than you care about what these peripheral people who know your parents think?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h17m55s">and then the answer to that is, well, of course, and then the question that arises out of that is:</a>
01:17:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h18m01s">why?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h18m09s">why is it logical that your parents' opinion makes any more difference to you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h20m11s">well, at some point you'll realize that the reason you can't ask that anymore is because they actually don't know any more than you do</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h20m48s">but that's no longer possible, he's passed that point, and that's why the father has disappeared</a>
01:20:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h20m55s">and so, Gepetto has gone off to look for Pinokio, because he also needs a son</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h21m01s">but in any case, the house is abandoned</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h21m04s">and so then we see inside the house that everything's covered in cobwebs, and everything's gone</a>
01:21:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h21m10s">and Pinokio and the Cricket sit on the steps and they're very concerned; first of all they wonder where he went</a>
01:21:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h21m15s">so they're actually concerned that he's gone, but they also don't know what to do, because there's just no going home</a>
01:21:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h21m21s">and so, you know, that's also the case that once you hit a certain point in your development...</a>
01:21:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h21m27s">well, it's the same thing we already talked about, the answers that you are looking for are not going to be found in your parents' house</a>
01:21:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h21m34s">it's as simple as that, now you could artificially maintain your dependency, but, you know</a>
01:21:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h21m40s">if you do that for too long, things get pretty ugly, so you get pretty stale, and</a>
01:21:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h21m46s">you know, you're like bread that's been on the shelf for too long</a>
01:21:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h21m49s">so, now they're wondering what to do, and where he could be</a>
01:21:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h21m53s">and then something very strange happens, the star shows up again, and it turns into a dove</a>
01:21:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h21m59s">and the dove flies down and puts a piece of paper bathed in light with gold writing on it in front of the Cricket and the puppet</a>
01:21:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h22m12s">so what in the world is going on there? well, we know what the star is, we've seen it multiple times, right</a>
01:22:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h22m18s">it's also the place that the blue fairy came from, but it's this transcendent place, it's this place that occurs sort of as this ultimate ideal</a>
01:22:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h22m27s">and this time it delivers a message; so what's happening here is that...</a>
01:22:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h22m35s">Pinokio is fundamentally oriented by the wish that his father made so long ago, right?</a>
01:22:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h22m41s">and the wish was that he would become a fully functioning individual; and so that's that transcendent place</a>
01:22:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h22m47s">and Jung would say...</a>
01:22:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h22m53s">when you orient your vision, different things appear to you in the world</a>
01:22:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h22m58s">so, and I mean this literally, so, because you can't see everything -</a>
01:22:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h23m04s">you vision calculates what's necessary, your brain calculates what's necessary for you to see so that you get to the point that you're aiming at</a>
01:23:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h23m11s">and I don't mean that metaphorically, I mean it literally</a>
01:23:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h23m16s">things that aren't relevant to what you're seeking, you won't see them</a>
01:23:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h23m23s">unless they get in your way, and they have to really block your pathway before they will be literally visible</a>
01:23:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h23m31s">so you orient yourself towards something, and that makes some things visible that wouldn't be visible and makes others invisible that you might have seen</a>
01:23:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h23m40s">and so when you change your orientation, what manifests itself in the world also changes</a>
01:23:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h23m45s">now, Pinokio is in despair here, and he asks himself: where could my father have gone?</a>
01:23:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h23m54s">and so, the question is: what exactly is he asking under those circumstances?</a>
01:23:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h24m00s">and what he's asking is something like: I had a structure that was orienting me properly in relationship to the world</a>
01:24:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h24m10s">and as far as it was embodied in my actual father it's now gone</a>
01:24:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h24m17s">is there any possibility that I can find that again?</a>
01:24:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h24m21s">and that is what you want, you see, like if you're in a chaotic circumstance, maybe you've escaped, let's say, from a bad relationship</a>
01:24:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h24m27s">or something like that, and you're out of it, but now you don't know what to do</a>
01:24:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h24m31s">what you're hoping is that you can get your life back together, right?</a>
01:24:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h24m37s">that you can put the pieces that have fallen apart back together</a>
01:24:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h24m41s">and so you're automatically going to generate a fantasy about producing another, let's call it stable state</a>
01:24:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h24m46s">you're gonna be looking for the spirit that yould enable that state to be generated</a>
01:24:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h24m51s">'cause really what it is in some sense is your new personality</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h24m55s">you're in chaos, you have to become something new in order to get out of chaos, and so you're hoping for that, you're hoping that you'll see it</a>
01:24:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h25m02s">and so, that's going to make certain things visible to you, that's the proper way of thinking about it</a>
01:25:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h25m11s">you know, when you get curious about something, maybe you're curious about something and you walk into a bookstore</a>
01:25:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h25m16s">that curiosity is going to guide you to a certain set of books</a>
01:25:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h25m20s">the fact that you have a question in mind is going to open your eyes to certain kinds of possibilities</a>
01:25:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h25m26s">and so if your goal is to reestablish your union with the positive father, let's say</a>
01:25:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h25m32s">then certain things are gonna appear, and other things aren't, and that's what this represents</a>
01:25:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h25m38s">the transcendent star is the goal, which is this developmental process</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h25m43s">it's capable of, let's say, delivering a message to you; in some sense that's what's happening when you're thinking</a>
01:25:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h25m49s">you know, because you have a problem you wanna solve, you have somewhere you wanna go with your thoughts</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h25m54s">and as a consequence of that information reveals itself to you in the interior landscape</a>
01:25:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h26m01s">it's a very strange thing; you know, in some sense it feels as though you're producing the thoughts, but</a>
01:26:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h26m06s">it could equally be said that you're watching the thoughts reveal themselves</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h26m11s">and which of those is more accurate is by no means obvious; you can certainly have thoughts that surprise you</a>
01:26:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h26m17s">which is very strange, it's like,  they're your thoughts. How in the world can they surprise you, but they do</a>
01:26:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h26m21s">so, it's like you didn't know them before you thought them up and then the question is well where did they come from</a>
01:26:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h26m26s">if you didn't know them before you thought them up?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h26m28s">Well, they sort of spring out of the void.</a>
01:26:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h26m30s">That's one way of thinking about it. Anyways...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h26m36s">this is a Holy Ghost symbol, this dove, as well, so that puts some Christian imagery in here again</a>
01:26:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h26m44s">You could think of it as a manifestation of the spirit of transformation.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h26m48s">That's another way of looking at it. Anyways, it's the conscience that interprets the letter</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h26m53s">figuring out what the next thing should be, and weirdly enough, what the letter says is that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h26m57s">Geppetto was out looking for Pinocchio and he got swallowed by a whale</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h27m04s">which makes very little sense to put it bluntly</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h27m16s">We leap right over that tremendous gap in logic</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h27m22s">and follow the story nonetheless. Okay, so what's the idea here?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h27m36s">there's the possibility that things can come back together</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h27m47s">And  so you can conceptualize that symbolically as</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h27m52s">the existence of the dead father at the bottom of the chaotic landscape</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h27m58s">That's the proper way, as far as I can tell, to think about it.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h28m01s">It's like there's something down there that's capable of re-forming and reemerging that's</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h28m18s">well, you generate order, it's going to be akin to the order that you had before</a>
01:28:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h28m22s">but there's going to be something new about it as well, so it's down to the bottom of the chaotic state,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h29m32s">this is what university is for. It's so that you can go into the chaos,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h30m37s">your goal is to make yourself as articulate in writing and thinking and speaking as you possibly can</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h31m17s">effectively; and they can defend themselves when they're challenged</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h32m13s">it doesn't take much of a transformation to move from that place to the next</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h36m51s">because God's upset with him, because he got this direct command to go straighten out this city and he ran off, and so</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h37m59s">and then the Cricket has got this weird, paradoxical response to that; on the one hand he's</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h38m04s">he's sort of pulling Pinokio back, saying: look, you know, this is foolhardy</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h38m29s">really dangerous and foolhardy, but it's also necessary, and so he plays this dual role</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h38m48s">you should take your doubts and the chaos that you're enveloped in seriously</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h38m52s">you should face it and think it through, you should go into it as far as you can go into it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h39m28s">this weird intermingling of those two things; and as far as I can tell, that's because</a>
01:39:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h39m34s">when you're in chaos and you don't know what's going on, then you start imagining what might be going on</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h39m44s">but it's also partly the structure of your unconscious mind, which is producing the fantasies, and so</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h39m49s">when you're truly in chaos, then the distinction between your fantasies and reality isn't clear</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h40m29s">well, then the reality, like, the reality is the reality and your imagination at the same time</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h40m42s">it was a Jungian idea... I could say that's the snitch that Harry Potter's chasing, by the way</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h40m56s">that can manifest itself as the world if you pursue it, it's roughly that</a>
01:40:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h41m03s">so Pinokio's in this situation that's half-fantasy and half-reality, in this chaotic state</a>
01:41:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h41m09s">and he has to go down to find the thing that he least wants to find</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h41m13s">and he's hoping that it... he's got this intuition that in facing that thing, that chaos that life really is, that chaos</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h41m20s">that he's going to find his father and reunite with him</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h41m28s">so you could also say that in some sense it's a decision of faith, i suppose, because</a>
01:41:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h41m35s">you might ask yourself, well, why bother confronting chaos? if chaos is the ultimate reality, then what the hell use is facing it?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h41m43s">because it's just gonna reveal itself as the ultimate reality and drown you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h41m47s">but the myths always say the same thing, they say: "no, no, if you confront what's really disturbing you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h42m05s">that's the other thing, it's not like they're unerringly accurate, because</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h42m09s">you can be subsumed by chaos that's so total that even if you face it, you're not gonna prevail</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h42m17s">I mean, that's why people die, that's one way of looking at it anyways</a>
01:42:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h42m21s">but the mythology basically says that this is your best bet</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h42m25s">if there's a process that's going to work, this is it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h42m30s">and so, and then you might think, well, the better you do it, the better the chances are of success</a>
01:42:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h42m35s">or the more consistently you do it, the better the chances of success are</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h42m39s">and I think that that's a perfectly reasonable way of looking at it</a>
01:42:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h42m42s">ok, so anyways, Pinokio's down at the bottom of the ocean</a>
01:42:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h42m45s">and every time he says... he's trying  to find out where Monstro is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h42m58s">that's like Voldemort, right? he's the guy whose name you cannot say</a>
01:42:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h43m02s">and Monstro is precisely that, it's the thing that frightens everyone, and so</a>
01:43:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h43m08s">asking questions down there isn't helping very much, and so Pinokio, what he does is he's calling for his father, and he keeps going deeper and deeper into the depths</a>
01:43:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h43m16s">and there's a scene where</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h43m21s">the darkness of the ocean turns into an even more profound darkness, and that's what Pinokio disappears into</a>
01:43:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h43m27s">and then we see Monstro, he's in this sort of foggy representation, this huge thing that lies very much at the bottom</a>
01:43:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h43m34s">and there's no life or anything around him except, I think these are mackerel, but maybe they're tuna</a>
01:43:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h43m40s">they're animated anyway, so it doesn't matter</a>
01:43:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h43m43s">but there's no life down there, he's so far down at the bottom of the ocean that there's nothing that's alive down there</a>
01:43:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h43m49s">so, and then we go inside the whale, which is, of course, abzurd</a>
01:43:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h43m53s">we see that the whale has eaten a boat at some point in the past, this is one whopping whale</a>
01:43:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h43m58s">and Gepetto is sitting with the kitten, of all things,</a>
01:43:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h44m02s">he's also got that litte goldfish bowl full of goldfish with him too, which is quite the feat</a>
01:44:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h44m06s">anyways, he's sitting there and he knows that he's trapped in the belly of the whale too, and that he can't get out</a>
01:44:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h44m13s">and so that's an interesting issue, because it's not only Pinokio is lacking his father, which isn't a good thing</a>
01:44:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h44m19s">but the father is lacking the son, and there's some indication that the father can't get out of the whale without the son</a>
01:44:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h44m26s">and so it's like the possibility for order is down there in this chaotic state</a>
01:44:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h44m31s">but unless there's an active agent to go seek it out, it can't pull itself... it's not animated enough to get out by itself</a>
01:44:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h44m39s">you know, and you could say, well, there's wisdom in the libraries, but it's not going to..</a>
01:44:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h44m42s">without you going in there and gathering it, and embodying it, all it does is sit there in potential in all of that...</a>
01:44:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h44m51s">imlicit form, that's a good way of thinking about it</a>
01:44:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h44m54s">so anyways, Gepetto is feeling pretty hopeless</a>
01:44:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h44m58s">because he can't figure out any way of getting out of the whale, and he's also starving</a>
01:44:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h45m02s">he's starving in the belly of the whale</a>
01:45:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h45m06s">here's a way of thinking about that:</a>
01:45:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h45m13s">Gepetto's a good guy, but he's old</a>
01:45:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h45m16s">and that means his way of doing things is no longer fruitful, that's why he's starving</a>
01:45:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h45m21s">and it's especially not fruitful, 'cause he's missing his son</a>
01:45:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h45m25s">he's missing the active element that the child represents, say, the playful and transformative element that the child represents</a>
01:45:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h45m31s">and so, if you get stuck doing something the same old way, at some point it's no longer going to work</a>
01:45:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h45m36s">even if it was good at some point; it has to be updated</a>
01:45:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h45m39s">and it's updated by, let's call it the spirit of youth, or the spirit of attention, or the spirit of play, something like that</a>
01:45:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h45m45s">the willingness to break boundaries and take risks; and Gepetto is very, very skilled, but</a>
01:45:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h45m51s">but he doesn't have that, and that's symbolized by the loss of his son</a>
01:45:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h45m55s">that's why he was out looking for his son too, he needs him; and so, they're in despair down there</a>
01:45:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h46m00s">trying to fish and not getting anything, and so...</a>
01:46:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h46m04s">Monstro wakes up</a>
01:46:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h46m08s">a mackerel happens to swim by and , and so...</a>
01:46:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h46m13s">I think they're tuna, actually, they look like tuna to me</a>
01:46:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h46m17s">and so, Monstro wakes up and he opens his mouth, and a bunch of water starts to come in</a>
01:46:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h46m23s">and so, and then you see Pinokio with the fish, now...</a>
01:46:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h46m30s">there's very intense implicit Christian symbolism in this part of the film</a>
01:46:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h46m35s">and I'm gonna lay it out point by point, so</a>
01:46:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h46m39s">you may remember and perhaps you don't, and perhaps you don't know, that</a>
01:46:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h46m43s">one of the symbols for Christ is a fish, ichthys, right?</a>
01:46:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h46m46s">and that's a play on the Greek representation of Christ's name, buyt there's more to it than that, because</a>
01:46:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h46m52s">all of Christ's followers are fishermen</a>
01:46:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h46m55s">and he performs a bunch of miracles with fish; and fish are strange things</a>
01:46:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h46m59s">because, well, you can pull then up out of the depths, that's part of it</a>
01:46:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h47m02s">and so they're things that can be pulled out of the depth; and you could say that...</a>
01:47:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h47m08s">it's going to be very difficult for me to take this apart, but you can say in some sense that Christ is a meta-fish</a>
01:47:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h47m14s">a fish is something that you can dine on</a>
01:47:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h47m18s">but a way of being is something that provides you with something to dine on on a continual basis</a>
01:47:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h47m25s">and so, you might say, well, is it better to have a fish or to be a fisherman?</a>
01:47:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h47m30s">that's another way of thinking about it, and obviously it's better to be a fisherman, because then you can get more fish</a>
01:47:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h47m35s">and so, it's one thing to have something, but it's another thing completely to know how to generate good things</a>
01:47:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h47m43s">and so, if you had any sense, you'd take the latter over the former</a>
01:47:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h47m48s">even though the former is more instantaneously gratifying and requires less work and responsibility</a>
01:47:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h47m53s">and so, anyways, the whale opens his mouth and goes chasing these fish</a>
01:47:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h47m58s">and Pinokio tries... he's trying to get the hell out of there, even though he wants to find the whale</a>
01:47:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h48m03s">when he actually sees the whale, he leaves</a>
01:48:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h48m05s">and that's also a very common mythological, umm, what would you call it? plot element</a>
01:48:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h48m13s">it's very frequently that what happens when the hero first sees the terrible thing, the dragon, say</a>
01:48:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h48m18s">the terrible thing that he's come to conquer he freezes and gets the hell out of there, because</a>
01:48:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h48m22s">it's far worse than he thought it was going to be; and so Pinokio is like: no way, man</a>
01:48:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h48m27s">I'm not going near that whale; and away he swims, and he's actually at the forefront of all the fish, which is quite interesting too</a>
01:48:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h48m33s">so, in the mean time Monstro has opened his mouth, and the fish are pouring in, and Gepetto is fishing like mad, and he's catching fish</a>
01:48:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h48m41s">like crazy; and so, the little cat is...</a>
01:48:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h48m45s">Gepetto is flinging the fish backwards into this, like, box</a>
01:48:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h48m49s">and the little cat is there, whacking them to kill them while they're flopping around</a>
01:48:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h48m54s">and so they're pretty excited about this, because... they have a problem, the problem is how to get out of the whale</a>
01:48:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h49m00s">that's the actual problem; but a nested problem inside that is how not to starve to death</a>
01:49:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h49m06s">and so, Gepetto's pretty happy that even though he's not getting out of the whale, that he gets to have something to eat</a>
01:49:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h49m11s">so you could say as well, that he's not exactly focused on the right thing</a>
01:49:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h49m16s">he's focused on the micro-problem instead of the macro-problem, and that makes him kind of blind</a>
01:49:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h49m20s">so anyways, the whale swallows up Pinokio, and</a>
01:49:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h49m27s">Gepetto keeps fishing; and then he snags Pinokio</a>
01:49:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h49m31s">now this is cool, because... and this is another example of that meta-fish idea</a>
01:49:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h49m37s">it's like... Gepetto's actually looking not for a fish, he's looking for a way out of the damn whale</a>
01:49:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h49m44s">and then he catches a bunch of fish, and he's like focused on that like mad</a>
01:49:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h49m47s">and then he catches Pinokio, and Pinokio represents what would get him out of the whale</a>
01:49:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h49m52s">but he's so bloody obsessed with the fish tha he doesn't even notice</a>
01:49:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h49m56s">so he catches Pinokio and flings him into the fish basket</a>
01:49:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h49m59s">and so, it signifies the blindness of Gepetto's orientation</a>
01:49:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h50m04s">when he's inside the whale, that's kind of a comment on his aged and insufficient nature</a>
01:50:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h50m11s">he's solving the wrong... he's solving the problem very well, but it's the wrong problem</a>
01:50:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h50m15s">so anyways, he fires Pinokio into the fish bin, and</a>
01:50:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h50m19s">Pinokio says: Father! I'm here; and Gepetto says: Don't bother me right now, Pinokio, I'm busy fishing</a>
01:50:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h50m28s">well then, that's fine, so then he kinda wakes up, he has this little moment of insight, this little revelation, that</a>
01:50:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h50m34s">well, he's caught Pinokio, so who cares about the damn fish; so then he runs over to the fish box to grab Pinokio</a>
01:50:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h50m39s">and instead he grabs a fish, and gives it a kiss</a>
01:50:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h50m42s">and so that is another way of hammering home the fact that he's...</a>
01:50:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h50m45s">there's this confusion that he's suffering from</a>
01:50:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h50m48s">he can't distinguish the local truth from the transcendent truth</a>
01:50:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h50m53s">and so anyways, he does figure it out; he tosses the fish aside and he grabs Pinokio</a>
01:50:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h50m58s">they're all thriled to death to see each other, and so they're united</a>
01:50:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h51m02s">so Pinokio has found his father, but they're still trapped in the belly of the whale; now</a>
01:51:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h51m07s">Pinokio takes off his hat, he gets covered with a blanket, he takes off his hat, and</a>
01:51:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h51m12s">he reveals his jackass ears, and so</a>
01:51:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h51m15s">he's found his father, but he's damaged, and not... Pinokio, he's damaged and not in good shape</a>
01:51:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h51m21s">he isn't becoming what he was supposed to be; in fact, he's actually degenerated since Gepetto saw him last</a>
01:51:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h51m27s">and so, he becomes embarrassed, and he says he has a tail</a>
01:51:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h51m31s">he says: that's nothing, I have a tail too, and then he spins that around kinda laughing</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h51m35s">and he brays and gets really embarrassed, and so, that's what you see here, he looks like, well...</a>
01:51:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h51m40s">he's revealed himself as a jackass to his father</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h51m44s">but you know, that's actually a good thing, because...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h51m50s">he is a jackass, and if he was unwilling to admit his insufficiency</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h51m58s">he wouldn't have ever gone on this pursuit, so...</a>
01:51:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h52m06s">it's this perverse willingness to note that he isn't all that he could be</a>
01:52:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h52m13s">that's part of what drives him to find everything that his father represents</a>
01:52:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h52m17s">it's a humility, and it's an admission of insufficiency</a>
01:52:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h52m22s">and you need that before you're going to learn anything, because before you learn anything you have to</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h52m32s">and maybe that you're a braying jackass</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h52m35s">and so, that's why there are injunctions in many religious in many religious writings</a>
01:52:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h52m39s">that positively portray humility, as the antidote to arrogance</a>
01:52:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h52m45s">that's the right way of thinking about it, is that humility means: I still have something to learn</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h52m51s">I'm insufficient, I still have something to learn</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h52m53s">it's exactly the opposite, say of Lampwick's attitude</a>
01:52:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h52m57s">anyways, Gepetto decides that son puppet who's half-jackass is better than no son at all</a>
01:52:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h53m03s">which is another indication of his relatively positive orientation towards the world</a>
01:53:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h53m08s">and they reunite; and then</a>
01:53:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h53m11s">Pinokio immediately sets his eyes on the main problem, it's like: hey, we're stuck in this whale, we need to get out of here!</a>
01:53:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h53m17s">and it turns out that Geppetto has already built a raft, but there's a problem, and the problem is that</a>
01:53:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h53m22s">as Gepetto says... Pinokio says: well, we'll wait for his mouth to open</a>
01:53:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h53m26s">and Gepetto says: that doesn't work, because when he opens his mouth, Monstro opens his mouth, everything comes in, and nothing goes out</a>
01:53:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h53m33s">so, raft - fine, but there's no way of using it</a>
01:53:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h53m36s">and so, Gepetto decides that they're not going to bother with that problem</a>
01:53:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h53m41s">and they're gonna go have some fish</a>
01:53:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h53m44s">but Pinokio, his eyes is still on the main prize, he thinks: no way, man, we're getting out of this whale</a>
01:53:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h53m49s">that's the fundamental think, we're not going to rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic</a>
01:53:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h53m54s">we're going to attend to the fact that it's sinking, we're gonna keep our eye on the primary problem</a>
01:53:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h53m59s">so he's a little more awake by now; so Pinokio says:</a>
01:53:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h54m02s">we'll make a fire; now that's cool, I think, because</a>
01:54:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h54m06s">he's down in chaos, where his father is trapped, and the first thing he does is to use fire</a>
01:54:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h54m11s">and of course that's exactly what people do, right, 'cause we're fire-users; and so</a>
01:54:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h54m15s">and shaman, for example, are masters of fire; but there's this really primordial element to this story right here, and</a>
01:54:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h54m22s">it's an indication that the thing that can transform chaos into productive order</a>
01:54:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h54m30s">is also the same spirit that mastered fire</a>
01:54:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h54m33s">and so, Pinokio lays that out; and he says: we're gonna build a fire!</a>
01:54:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h54m37s">and we'll fill him up with smoke!</a>
01:54:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h54m41s">and Gepetto says: great, smoked fish!</a>
01:54:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h54m45s">so he's still stuck on this whole fish thing</a>
01:54:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h54m47s">and so Pinokio runs around gathering up all the spare wood on the boat</a>
01:54:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h54m52s">including the furniture, which he starts to break; and Gepetto says:</a>
01:54:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h54m55s">well, what are we going to sit on? you know, while we eat our smoked fish</a>
01:54:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h54m59s">and Pinokio basically says, politely: you know, enough with the damn fish thing</a>
01:54:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h55m04s">I'm going to fill the whale with smoke, and that's gonna make him sneeze, and then we can get the hell out of here</a>
01:55:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h55m11s">and Gepetto says: that's gonna make him mad, it's not a good idea</a>
01:55:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h55m16s">and, well, I would say that that's the stance of the benevolent state against innovation</a>
01:55:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h55m24s">you know, even if the innovation is positive, and even if it's transformative and freeing</a>
01:55:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h55m28s">the old state, even if it's good, it's going to stand in opposition to that</a>
01:55:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h55m32s">and so that's also something that's very useful to know, because otherwise you can get bitter about that</a>
01:55:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h55m36s">anyways, Pinokio makes this big fire, Gepetto's pretty worried about it</a>
01:55:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h55m40s">and he starts to fill the whale up with smoke; and so this is where the whale turns into a fire-breathing dragon</a>
01:55:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h55m45s">which is quite cool, it's like in Sleeping Beauty, Maleficent turns into a fire-spewing dragon as well</a>
01:55:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h55m52s">and if you watch the Little Mermaid, that... what's her name? Ursula</a>
01:55:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h55m57s">she turns into a gigantic snake-like creature as well, although she doesn't exactly spew fire</a>
01:55:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h56m03s">but the transformation of the ultimate monster into something like a dragon is very, very common</a>
01:56:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h56m10s">'cause it's the ultimate symbol of the unknown for a variety of reasons that we'll dusciss later</a>
01:56:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h56m14s">so anyways... yes, it's a symbol of chaos</a>
01:56:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h56m21s">anyways, and this is quite a horrifying scene; when my son watched, and he watched Pinokio when he was about 4</a>
01:56:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h56m27s">he watched this scene over, and over, and over; I don't know how many times he watched that movie, but it must've been a hundred times</a>
01:56:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h56m32s">but he was really fascinated by this scene</a>
01:56:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h56m36s">and you know, he was like locked on to it, it was frightening, but there was something in it that he was processing and catching (?) on to</a>
01:56:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h56m44s">so anyways, you see the whale is starting to prepare to sneeze, and he's belching out huge quantities of smoke and fire</a>
01:56:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h56m51s">and Pinokio and Gepetto and the cat and the goldfish bowl are all on the raft</a>
01:56:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h56m59s">trying desperately to get out of the whale, which inhales and pulls them back, and then sneezes and pushes them forward</a>
01:56:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h57m05s">and at some point they actually break free, and there's a 'gates of hell' image there with the whale</a>
01:57:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h57m11s">belching out smoke like mad and  its jaws open</a>
01:57:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h57m15s">so they're paddling madly away, to get away from this whale</a>
01:57:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h57m19s">and the whale is very angry, just as Gepetto suggested</a>
01:57:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h57m24s">and there's interesting sound effects that go along with this</a>
01:57:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h57m28s">the whale actually turns into a...</a>
01:57:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h57m33s">that's what happens when your phone is smarter than you are</a>
01:57:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h57m36s">the whale actually turns into into something that's like a locomotive</a>
01:57:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h57m40s">and the sound effects become industrial; so it's this monstrous, machine-like locomotive dragon</a>
01:57:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h57m47s">that's bent on the destruction of Pinokio</a>
01:57:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h57m52s">and you could say it's an amalgam of natural and social forces, completely unleashed</a>
01:57:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h57m57s">everything's unleashed against Pinokio and his father, and so...</a>
01:57:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h58m02s">they're having a hell of a time, there's big waves, and they end up...</a>
01:58:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h58m06s">the whale actually abandons them, but before he does that, it nails them with its tail, and blows the raft into smithereens</a>
01:58:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h58m11s">and so then they'e both in the water, and Gepetto and Pinokio are drowning</a>
01:58:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h58m15s">and Gepetto actually goes down for the third time, so to speak; and as he's going down, he says to Pinokio:</a>
01:58:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h58m22s">save yourself, save yourself</a>
01:58:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h58m25s">and so that's kinda Pinokio's last temptation, because Gepetto's had it, and he could just get to shore on his own</a>
01:58:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h58m31s">but he would've abandoned his father; and so that's the thing, is...</a>
01:58:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h58m36s">and that's one of the issues that this movie grapples with, is: what exactly is your responsibility?</a>
01:58:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h58m41s">and you could say: well, it's to save yourself, but the myth that underlies this says: no it's not, that 's not exactly right</a>
01:58:41</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=01h59m47s">because that insufficiency that characterized him</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h01m10s">so, the next scene we see them back at home, and he's lying dead on the bed</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h01m28s">and so, it's like he's pushed himself to his limits, and a natural process kicks back in, and revivifies him</a>
02:01:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h01m35s">but now he's no longer a jackass puppet, he's actually something that's real</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h01m41s">and so then he wakes up and he notices that now, you know, he's undergone this proper transformation</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h01m48s">he notices his hands in particular</a>

02:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h01m58s">so, you know, Pinokio convinces him that he's not dead, and then</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h02m03s">in celebration they start the clocks again, and so time kicks back in at that point</a>
02:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h02m07s">and so, then they have a big celebration, music happens again, because this is a celebratory moment</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h02m15s">and they dance, and the harmony's restored, the good old guy has his son, and so</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h02m23s">the house is properly set up, and the old state has its vision, and its capacity for transformation</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h02m29s">and the thing that transforms has the stability of the culture behind it, and so - perfect</a>
02:02:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h02m34s">and then the Cricket goes outside, and he's talking to the Start and the Blue Fairy, and he says that he's pretty happy about how this has gone</a>
02:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h02m42s">and so, then she gives him this little medal</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h02m58s">it doesn't tarnish, and so it's a metal that represents the sun; and he flashes his little badge at the Star</a>
02:02:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h03m06s">establishing a relationship between his function as the proper conscience and his orientation towards the highest good</a>

02:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h03m19s">so he's also transformed and developed as a consequence of this entire process</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h04m03s">[student] you seem to have a vaguely psychoanalytic approach to kind of extracting the inarticulated messages</a>
02:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h04m10s">from the mythologies and the stories and religion that's developed over time</a>
02:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h04m14s">so could you almost say that those are kind of constructing this to a societal level out of the individual level</a>
02:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h04m22s">that these are kind of the dreams of the collective unconscious?</a>
02:04:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h04m25s">[Peterson] sure, that's exactly what they are</a>
02:04:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h04m28s">they're the fantasies of the collective unconscious, that's one way of looking at it</a>
02:04:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h04m32s">I mean, they also take a socially determined form</a>
02:04:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h04m37s">right, because it's animated, and that's a technology, and it's obviously something that exists in a particular time and place</a>
02:04:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h04m47s">but yeah, they're... it's a collective attempt to give voice to the oldest of behavioral patterns</a>
02:04:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h04m53s">and so, here's one way of thinking about that</a>
02:04:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h04m56s">which we'll talk about in some detail, which you should have read about, at least to some degree, already</a>
02:04:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h05m01s">the question is: where is that knowledge represented?</a>
02:05:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h05m05s">and Jung would say, well it's part of the collective unconscious, and it's got a biological origin, but</a>
02:05:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h05m13s">his description of the biological nature of the collective unconscious is quite ambiguous</a>
02:05:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h05m21s">and I think that that's because it actually is ambiguous, like</a>
02:05:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h05m24s">for example, we know that primates, and humans in particular, are at least biologically predisposed to be afraid of snakes</a>
02:05:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h05m34s">so we can learn that very easily; now, you could make a case that it's more than biological predisposition, and that it's actually built in</a>
02:05:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h05m41s">but I would say the predisposition idea is actually a better one, because you at least need the exposure to the snake to get it going</a>
02:05:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h05m49s">so that would take place as a consequence of your experience, so it's not purely biological, although</a>
02:05:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h05m55s">it is the case that snake fear tends to become more intense as you get older, which is not necessarily what you would expect</a>
02:05:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h06m03s">and the... I just read a paper this week, localizing snake fear in primates, and it was hypothalamic</a>
02:06:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h06m09s">it's really old, because the hypothalamus is a very old part of the brain, it's older than the amygdala</a>
02:06:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h06m15s">and the amygdala is involved in snake fear as well, it's really, really old</a>
02:06:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h06m20s">so you could say, well, you're prepared to develop snake fear, like you're prepared to develop language</a>
02:06:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h06m26s">and like you're prepared to walk by your biological structure</a>
02:06:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h06m30s">now, whether that actually  constitutes the contents of your memory, which is what Jung seems to imply</a>
02:06:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h06m36s">is an open question, but it doesn't really matter, because...</a>
02:06:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h06m42s">so, one time when I went to visit my nephew, he was running around in a knight suit</a>
02:06:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h06m50s">he was only about 4 or 5; so he's acting out this mythological pattern, roughly speaking</a>
02:06:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h06m57s">and you'd say, well, how did he know how to do that, and the answer would be: well, it was represented all around him in the culture</a>
02:06:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h07m03s">in fragments, and like</a>
02:07:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h07m06s">kids are pretty good in putting fragments of stories together</a>
02:07:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h07m09s">that's really what understanding is, is to put fragments into story form</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h07m14s">and so, he watched Disney movies and his parents had read him storeis, and he did pretend play with the other kids, and</a>
02:07:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h07m21s">all of those were like exemplars of this underlying narrative</a>
02:07:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h07m25s">they're variants of it; and because he can abstract and generalize, he's pulling out the central features of those narratives</a>
02:07:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h07m32s">the heroic features, and then embodying them; so you could say, well</a>
02:07:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h07m36s">the central features of these narratives are fragmented and distributed across the entire culture</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h07m43s">and so, they don't have to be exactly inside your head, they don't have to be part of your memory</a>
02:07:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h07m49s">they're distributed in the behavior, and the actions, and the stories of the entire culture</a>
02:07:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h07m54s">and they just... you can put them together out of that</a>
02:07:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h07m58s">so, and people do that, that's why they're so hungry for stories like...</a>
02:07:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h08m02s">well, like this one, or like Star Wars, or like Star Trek, or like the Marvel movies, or like Harry Potter</a>
02:08:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h08m10s">[student] yeah, what you said about the last scene, your son watching it over and over again</a>
02:08:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h08m15s">my little brother did the same thing with the last scene of the first Harry Potter movie, the guy with the two faces?</a>
02:08:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h08m19s">he watched that probably 20 or 30 times</a>
02:08:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h08m22s">yeah, that's really interesting, watching little kids interact... like those movies are unbelievably complex</a>
02:08:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h08m27s">I mean, you know, by the time you're your age, and you've seen, you know, several hundred of then at minimum</a>
02:08:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h08m33s">the impact wears off, but it's really something, sitting down with a four-year-old</a>
02:08:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h08m38s">who hasn't watched very many movies, and walking through one with them, I mean they're so turned on it's just...</a>
02:08:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h08m44s">I took my daughter when she was too young, actually... I took her to see "The Mask", the Jim Carrey movie</a>
02:08:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h08m49s">Jesus, I mean she survived it, I don't think I traumatized her</a>
02:08:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h08m53s">but she was sitting on my lap, and it was really like gripping a bundle of barbed wire</a>
02:08:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h09m00s">she was just like that the entire movie, you know</a>
02:09:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h09m03s">and half way through I thought: well, that's probably a little too much psychophysiological intensity for one small body</a>
02:09:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h09m09s">you know, but she... those movies, they just have a massive impact on little kids</a>
02:09:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h09m13s">and they will do exactly that, they'll watch it over and over, and over, and you think: what are they doing exactly?</a>
02:09:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h09m18s">they're trying to understand, they're gripped by it somehow</a>
02:09:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h09m23s">right, and it's like they're deeply curious, they know there's something in it</a>
02:09:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h09m28s">and they're trying to extract out what it is, and they'll repeat it, and repeat it, so...</a>
02:09:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h09m34s">they're hungry for the information 'cause it's part of rescuing their father from chaos, that's one way of thinking about it</a>
02:09:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h09m44s">other questions?</a>
02:09:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h09m49s">well, good enough then, let's call it a day; oh, there is one more question</a>
02:09:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h09m56s">[student] so, in Maps of Meaning there is the idea that you keep returning to about</a>
02:09:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h10m02s">when you first encounter the unknown it's like, it's first fearful; and then Jung has the idea of archetypes, so</a>
02:10:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h10m11s">are there other kinds of meaning that people will find in new information that's already patterned into them?</a>
02:10:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h10m19s">[Peterson] that's patterned into them or into the new information?</a>
02:10:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h10m21s">[student] that's patterned into them, like ???, do people actually...?</a>
02:10:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h10m26s">sure, well, they project the contents of their fantasy onto the unknown thing</a>
02:10:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h10m32s">and that's partly a process of self-discovery</a>
02:10:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h10m37s">you know, so, for example, let's say that you, you know, you're gripped by love at first sight or something like that</a>
02:10:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h10m45s">now, you don't know anything about the person that you're tremendously attracted to</a>
02:10:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h10m49s">but you'll have fantasies about them</a>
02:10:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h10m52s">and that fantasy... in fact, your image of them is a fantasy</a>
02:10:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h10m55s">and if you take that fantasy apart, you'll find out what you value</a>
02:10:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h11m02s">so you are projecting, you're projecting yourself into the world; and you can discover...</a>
02:11:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h11m06s">I mean you may also discover something about them, because there may be elements of them that match the ideal quite nicely, if you're fortunate</a>
02:11:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h11m11s">and if your ideal is, you know, of a reasonable sort</a>
02:11:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h11m15s">but you can... you definitely encounter yourself if you look at the unknown</a>
02:11:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h11m20s">because you use your fantasy to structure the contact</a>
02:11:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h11m25s">you know, and the fundamental structure is:the heroic encounter with the unknown</a>
02:11:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h11m30s">because that's the pathway... that's the fundamental pathway of human beings, 'cause we're information foragers, fundamentally</a>
02:11:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h11m38s">[student] so it's that automatic response and the fantasies as well, that are part of the first contact...</a>
02:11:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h11m44s">[Peterson] sure, sure, well, that's also... yes, absolutely, that's exactly right, yes, so...</a>
02:11:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h11m51s">I mean, imagine this, imagine that you're attracted to someone, and you're just too terrified to go speak to her</a>
02:11:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h11m57s">well, what's happening? well, you have a fantasy of a judge</a>
02:11:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h12m02s">and that's your imagined representation of your own insufficiency in relationship to the ideal</a>
02:12:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h12m08s">and you project that on this person as a judge, and then you're too paralyzed to even open your mouth around her</a>
02:12:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h12m13s">very common experience</a>
02:12:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV16NEWld8Q#t=02h12m17s">okay, let's call it a day, we'll see you in a week</a>
