<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h00m23s">Lots of people who just attend to the law do do that because they're cowardly which is a Nietzschean  observation</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h01m07s">That's really worth thinking about because most of you many of you</a>
00:01:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h01m12s">But not all of you I suspect</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h01m14s">Have never really been somewhere that you could be really bad and get away with it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h01m18s">and so you might think well you wouldn't do it, but</a>
00:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h01m23s">But people do it all the time so</a>
00:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h01m26s">Anyways, they're talking about some exploits, and then they see that this character named Stromboli. Who's a marionette? He has a puppet show right and</a>
00:01:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h01m35s">he's kind of a wheeler-dealer too</a>
00:01:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h01m37s">Remember I showed you that knit that mask that was glaring out Pinocchio when he got his voice. It's like</a>
00:01:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h01m44s">Stromboli isn't one of his manifestations these the Fox here is another one of his</a>
00:01:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h01m49s">Manifestations and all the negative characters throughout the movie are manifestations of the same thing</a>
00:01:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h01m54s">It's partly the adversarial individual, and it's partly the tyrannical aspect of society. It's the negative masculine</a>
00:01:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h02m01s">That's that's one way of thinking about it so and you know when men go bad</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h02m05s">They often go bad by being antisocial and tyrannical so it where there's way more antisocial men than there are antisocial women</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h02m12s">Which is why there's 20 times many men in jail as there are women. You know? So each gender</a>
00:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h02m17s">Let's say each sex has its own path characteristic pathologies</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h02m21s">And there are some antisocial women you know and there are some high neuroticism guys</a>
00:02:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h02m25s">Who are who are or some guys who are really agreeable as well so but they're rarer</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h02m32s">So anyways he sees this this</a>
00:02:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h02m37s">Poster advertising Stromboli's puppet show. So Stromboli is a puppet master</a>
00:02:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h02m42s">Now that's really worth thinking about because that's an archetypal theme</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h02m47s">Or it's at least attached to an archetypal theme</a>
00:02:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h02m50s">Some things behind the scenes</a>
00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h02m52s">Pulling the strings and everybody always wonders what that is right? What's actually going on what's actually going on with Trump</a>
00:02:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h02m59s">Who's actually in control is it Putin? I mean, that's that's the that's the fantasies of the left its Putin</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h03m07s">It's like well</a>
00:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h03m09s">The question always is what's going on behind the scene right and the question is that's the case certainly on the political landscape?</a>
00:03:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h03m16s">business landscape</a>

00:03:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h03m19s">What's--what are you really up to?</a>
00:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h03m21s">Everyone's always wondering that right?</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h03m22s">That's why they're watching your eyes</a>
00:03:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h03m24s">Because your eyes point at things and they can infer</a>
00:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h03m27s">What you're interested in and then what you're up to by looking at what you look at.</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h03m32s">and that's why your eyes have whites</a>
00:03:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h03m34s">is so that we can see where you're pointing because gorillas don't and</a>
00:03:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h03m39s">So what that means roughly speaking is that all of your ancestors whose eyes couldn't be reliably tracked</a>
00:03:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h03m45s">are either killed or didn't mate</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h03m48s">It's a big deal for us to see where people's eyes are pointed, and so we're always watching each other's eyes constantly</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h03m54s">What are you up to? What are you up to?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h03m55s">What are you looking at?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h03m56s">What do you want?</a>
00:03:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h03m57s">and I want to know because if I know what you want I can predict how you're gonna behave and</a>
00:03:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h04m02s">That also means I can cooperate with you, or I can compete with you, or I can lie to you</a>
00:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h04m07s">but all the information is in the eyes is surrounded by the facial display right because that's also an indication of</a>
00:04:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h04m14s">motivation and emotion, and so we're trying our eyes are so good at that that for you guys sitting there in the back</a>
00:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h04m20s">I can tell if you're looking at my eyes are at my chin and the deviation in your eyes is so tiny</a>
00:04:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h04m27s">That it's--it's a kind of miracle that we're capable of making that perceptual observation</a>
00:04:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h04m32s">It's really important to us so and we have really good eyes, so that's another thing about us so anyways</a>
00:04:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h04m39s">What's going on behind the scenes? Well if you look at Stromboli</a>
00:04:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h04m43s">You might be thinking it's not clear he's someone you'd want to have pulling your strings like there's a little bit of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h04m50s">Forced enthusiasm, let's say there, and he's just not a very savory looking character</a>
00:04:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h04m56s">so anyways the Fox knows him and</a>
00:04:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h04m59s">They start talking about Stromboli that old Joker and then what they could how they could possibly</a>
00:04:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h05m04s">involve him in some sort of scam because he's back in town and then</a>
00:05:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h05m09s">they see the puppet and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h05m11s">The Fox does his equivalent of thinking, which is you know pretty sad, but and and nasty?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h05m17s">But that's what he does and then they see this puppet with no strings</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h05m21s">And they think hey man a puppet master would pay a lot for</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h05m24s">Something that is capable of semi- autonomous movement like that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h05m28s">it would be kind of a miracle and so they decided that they're going to take him to Stromboli and so they grab him and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h05m43s">That's the Fox uh acts out is sort of false enthusiasm</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h06m04s">and so</a>
00:06:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h06m05s">They don't go after kids that are</a>
00:06:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h06m08s">assertive and likely to be noisy they watch and they watch to see if they can find a kid who's defeated and</a>
00:06:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h06m17s">That's good enough. Who's defeated and who's gonna need a friend</a>
00:06:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h06m21s">And who's not going to object</a>
00:06:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h06m23s">And so when they check out these are the ones who do the stranger abductions which are by the way extraordinarily rare?</a>
00:06:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h06m29s">They look for a victim-type. They look for a kid who's going to be easy to take down and</a>
00:06:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h06m35s">So you know that's one thing you don't want so you might think well</a>
00:06:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h06m39s">One of the things that was really big</a>
00:06:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h06m42s">It's probably even worse now when I was a parent of young children was to teach your kids how to be afraid of strangers</a>
00:06:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h06m48s">It's like--uhhh</a>
00:06:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h06m49s">No.</a>
00:06:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h06m50s">Wrong. That is not what you teach them.</a>
00:06:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h06m53s">Because all you do is teach them then to be timid and fearful and the real predatory types they're-</a>
00:06:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h06m59s">They're pretty much thrilled about that because you'll also make them sheltered and naive</a>
00:06:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h07m04s">You know? (So that isn't) you make your kids courageous, and you get</a>

00:07:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h07m13s">So none of that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtP241Uu2S0#t=00h07m14s">terrifying</a>
