00:00:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h00m06s">not finished yet. So I'm going to finish that. For those who weren't there last time:</a>
00:00:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h00m10s">you can view the lecture, because it is online. We stopped at the depth psychologists,</a>
00:00:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h00m16s">that's the psychoanalysts. And the psychoanalysts are concerned with ...</a>
00:00:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h00m22s">To a psychoanalyst you are, as it were, a collection of somewhat integrated minds.</a>
00:00:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h00m29s">This is how you can see it as sub-personalities. You are not a unity.</a>
00:00:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h00m35s">And those sub-personalities are anchored in ... in all kinds of things.</a>
00:00:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h00m40s">They can arise from past experiences, especially from traumatic experiences. Or through socialization patterns that</a>
00:00:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h00m46s">were typical of your family. But they can also be rooted in basic biology</a>
00:00:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h00m51s">motivation systems. For example, a psychoanalyst would conceptualize anger or sexual attraction as</a>
00:00:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h00m58s">a subpersonality. And the reason for that is ... you know what's happening</a>
00:00:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h01m04s">when you get angry. You get mad at someone you love</a>
00:01:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h01m09s">and in a way you want to harm someone. You may just be arguing</a>
00:01:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h01m14s">want to win, and bring the other down while doing that.</a>
00:01:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h01m18s">But there is a desire that comes with anger. But many other things also happen.</a>
00:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h01m22s">For example, if someone annoys you even though you love them,</a>
00:01:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h01m27s">you will probably have easy access to all the memories you have at that point</a>
00:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h01m32s">how annoying he is, and difficult to access the memories of</a>
00:01:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h01m37s">how good he has been to you. You know that because sometimes you get angry</a>
00:01:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h01m41s">on someone, and you have a discussion. And only later do you realize what is happening</a>
00:01:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h01m44s">you come back to your senses, out of that possessed state, and you think, "Yes, I had</a>
00:01:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h01m50s">didn't really take context into account, and I was kind of blunt. "</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h01m55s">Then you think, "Who's in charge?" And that is the question where the psychoanalysts</a>
00:01:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h01m59s">are very interested in, and their answer is, "Not generally you."</a>
00:01:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h02m04s">In a way, it is terrifying reading, because people like to think of themselves</a>
00:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h02m08s">as the boss of their own house, so to speak, and that's only somewhat true.</a>
00:02:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h02m14s">You know that, because at the turn of the year you have ... what are those things called?</a>
00:02:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h02m22s">Good intentions. How you will improve yourself.</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h02m25s">One of the most common is: You will go to the gym three times a week.</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h02m29s">Not so. Very few people do that,</a>
00:02:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h02m33s">because it is difficult, and people don't like to do difficult things.</a>
00:02:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h02m37s">Because they are difficult, so that needs little explanation. But it also comes</a>
00:02:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h02m41s">because you can't just tell yourself what to do. And that is annoying, because life</a>
00:02:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h02m46s">would be much easier if you could just say, "Okay, sit down, study for two hours,</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h02m50s">don't watch cat videos on YouTube, or whatever you watch. "</a>
00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h02m54s">But no, it doesn't work like that. You sit there and study for a while,</a>
00:02:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h02m57s">and then you start thinking about cats, and before you know it, you're off to haunted houses</a>
00:02:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h03m01s">in London, or something like that. It's a scary idea because</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h03m09s">if you are not in charge of your own house ...</a>
00:03:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h03m13s">If you're not completely in control of yourself, which is so,</a>
00:03:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h03m17s">what controls you then?</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h03m18s">And Freud is interesting in that regard, because he was talking about</a>
00:03:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h03m23s">the driving force of fundamental motivation systems. For Freud these were mainly aggression and</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h03m28s">sexuality. And those are important drivers, make no mistake.</a>
00:03:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h03m31s">He saw you as ... saw the conscious part of your personality ...</a>
00:03:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h03m38s">like the captain of a ship with a very headstrong crew. That's a nice metaphor.</a>
00:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h03m43s">For the ship is on the sea, and the sea can be very rough.</a>
00:03:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h03m47s">You can only set a course, and then you have to deal with what happens.</a>
00:03:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h03m52s">And the stubborn shipmen, those are your urges ... but you shouldn't see them as drifts.</a>
00:03:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h03m57s">I like the psychoanalytic idea of ​​subpersonality because a subpersonality</a>
00:03:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h04m04s">has a perspective. It wants things and has plans. It's a living entity,</a>
00:04:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h04m10s">not a lifeless cognitive system. Freud was more interested in</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h04m15s">the biological foundation of the sub-personalities.</a>
00:04:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h04m21s">Because he was highly biologically oriented and he realized sexuality and aggression</a>
00:04:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h04m25s">very basic sub-personalities.</a>
00:04:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h04m28s">And then you have Jung, and Jung is much more terrifying than Freud. Which is telling,</a>
00:04:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h04m32s">because Freud is pretty scary. But Jung is incredibly terrifying.</a>
00:04:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h04m37s">According to Jung, the sub-personalities that make up you are thousands of years old.</a>
00:04:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h04m44s">They are cultural constructions that are thousands of years old,</a>
00:04:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h04m48s">and who have you in their grip. For example, Jung said,</a>
00:04:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h04m53s">i don't remember where i love this phrase it's so accurate.</a>
00:04:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h04m57s">You can think about it for five years, and still after that.</a>
00:04:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h05m03s">Jung said, "People don't have ideas, ideas own people."</a>
00:05:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h05m08s">That's something to think about, because think about your own situation.</a>
00:05:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h05m12s">No doubt you have political ideas, and you think, "I have political ideas."</a>
00:05:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h05m16s">No, not really, because you share those ideas with a lot of other people.</a>
00:05:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h05m21s">So they are definitely not yours. And not only that, they have had a long historical development</a>
00:05:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h05m28s">before you even got there. They are grounded in</a>
00:05:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h05m32s">the depth of your culture. And they are elaborated on by</a>
00:05:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h05m36s">one philosopher after another over the past two or three hundred years.</a>
00:05:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h05m41s">There's that whole system of thought, and "poof!" it takes over your brain, and you think:</a>
00:05:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h05m45s">"I have political ideas." Um, no, the political ideas own you.</a>
00:05:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h05m53s">And that's a wholesome thought, because that's one of the ways of controlling your obsession</a>
00:05:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h05m58s">to stop. Because people are constantly possessed by ideas.</a>
00:05:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h06m03s">That's what happened in Nazi Germany, that's what happened in the Soviet Union.</a>
00:06:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h06m07s">It happens all the time everywhere. You may think, "Possession is a bit strong." But that's not true.</a>
00:06:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h06m13s">Obviously it is a metaphor, but it is one</a>
00:06:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h06m18s">appropriate metaphor, for a collection of ideas, such as political ideas, are a living thing.</a>
00:06:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h06m23s">They are not lifeless, dusty words on a bookshelf, somewhere. They are part of</a>
00:06:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h06m29s">a dynamic society. And the driving force of those ideas motivates you. They have you</a>
00:06:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h06m35s">in their grasp. You can tell when you talk to someone who is completely obsessed with</a>
00:06:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h06m40s">an idea system, or an ideological system, because that is deadly boring.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h40m58s">And usually when a story is 2,500 years old, it is much older than that.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtnhtEg76k#t=00h44m49s">Because you read fiction, and it is true. But that's not it,</a>
