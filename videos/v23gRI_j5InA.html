<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h01m09s">He tells a story about a monster</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h01m18s">Rather, it completely changed the truth of the story and this is the part of the story that people remember</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h01m35s">Why is this happening ??</a>
00:01:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h01m41s">I think Mark Twain</a>
00:01:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h01m43s">Known as Samuel Clemens, I think it was he who said:</a>
00:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h01m45s">"One of the advantages of telling the truth is that you do not have to remember what you said."</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h01m50s">And - my God, this is exciting and worth listening to because it is</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h01m57s">Well, there are many things I learned while in the clinic</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h02m00s">One of them is that, since you are often in an awkward position, sometimes with people, if you are a doctor in the clinic.</a>
00:02:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h02m04s">Because some things that happen often don't usually.</a>
00:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h02m07s">And you do not know how to behave in these situations.</a>
00:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h02m08s">Then, what I learned was to say what is happening now</a>
00:02:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h02m11s">No matter what it is, I'm just trying to explain it</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h02m15s">For example, and nothing more than worrying about its consequences</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h02m20s">You know, I don't look for problems, however</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h02m23s">If you are in ... this may save you and your life sometimes</a>
00:02:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h02m26s">Especially if you are working with a terrified person who is very frightened</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h02m30s">Do not lie to a frightened and violent person</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h02m33s">Because when you lie, you make yourself an ally of the forces that try to harm him immediately</a>
00:02:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h02m38s">And this panic makes the sufferer more alert as if he is under the influence of a drug (amphetamines - a type of prohibited drug).</a>
00:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h02m42s">In fact it can make people panic when you give them (amphetamines).</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h02m46s">It can make them more frightened by giving them a stronger dose of the drug (amphetamine).</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h02m50s">Well, they are more alert,</a>
00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h02m51s">Because they feel everything around them is against them</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h02m54s">And they watch you in a way that you believe it is more intense than you see them</a>
00:02:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h02m59s">And when you mess with a lie when you talk to them, you are done for them</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h03m07s">So one thing is certain is that when you are in a really bad situation and you don't know what to do</a>
00:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h03m13s">You should always tell the truth, but very little. Do not reveal too much because this is another lie.</a>
00:03:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h03m18s">Just cautiously say the least possible truth and hopefully he can get out of the situation.</a>
00:03:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h03m23s">Maybe you get out of the situation, maybe you get out of it</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h03m27s">But when the facts are falsified</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h03m30s">be careful</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h03m32s">The truth is a defense mechanism to get out of deadlock and dangerous situations</a>
00:03:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h03m37s">If someone is trying to frighten you and you think that he could turn into a violent person.</a>
00:03:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h03m41s">And they ask you are you afraid Then tell them that you are very frightened and wish that things are going well</a>
00:03:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h03m49s">Or say</a>
00:03:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h03m52s">I'll give you an example</a>
00:03:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h03m54s">One time I was at the airport</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h03m58s">And we were in line for the plane leaving to Canada and this is the line for international flights</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h04m03s">The line was very long, about 50 people</a>
00:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h04m06s">There were 3 people in front of me, and about 40 behind me</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h04m10s">And the person in charge decided to close the track and told us that we should all go to the other line, which was about 300 people.</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h04m17s">And I suggested to him, that he not do it. Because we had been in line for about an hour</a>
00:04:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h04m22s">And he can fulfill our column which contains 20 remaining people</a>
00:04:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h04m25s">And he takes a thought,</a>
00:04:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h04m27s">But he called the police immediately</a>
00:04:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h04m29s">This was in Florida and after the events of 9/11</a>
00:04:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h04m33s">The police came heavily armed</a>
00:04:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h04m38s">And he told them to create trouble</a>
00:04:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h04m41s">But I did not do anything except that I did not ..</a>
00:04:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h04m45s">I didn't make ...</a>
00:04:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h04m47s">How can I say it?</a>
00:04:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h04m48s">I did nothing but not let the bureaucratic grumpy thumbs take advantage of me, and this is not the same as making trouble.</a>
00:04:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h04m55s">Well anyway, as soon as the police arrived I told them to look</a>
00:04:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h04m58s">I will do what they ask of me immediately</a>
00:04:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h05m01s">And I am because I am the source of problems</a>
00:05:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h05m03s">But I want you to hear what exactly happened to me</a>
00:05:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h05m06s">This is a good example of what you should do in such situations</a>
00:05:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h05m10s">If there is someone who has been able to you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h05m12s">Don't brag, that's a really bad idea</a>
00:05:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h05m15s">And I was ready to do whatever they asked of me because as you know</a>
00:05:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h05m19s">They didn't know who I was. I also do not know what they were told about me</a>
00:05:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h05m23s">In any case</a>
00:05:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h05m26s">The problem with lying is that it has multiple heads</a>
00:05:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h05m29s">And children know this from a young age.</a>
00:05:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h05m33s">Because when you tell a lie, this has consequences that you may escape</a>
00:05:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h05m37s">It may have 3 or 4 consequences that you did not realize or anticipate</a>
00:05:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h05m39s">And it is relatively large in complexity</a>
00:05:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h05m43s">Then you have to link one lie to another smaller</a>
00:05:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h05m45s">You have to track it down and it also grows 3 more complications quickly</a>
00:05:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h05m50s">This little lie grows into a big ball of lies, and becomes evident in the form of a fondness for everyone</a>
00:05:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h05m56s">And then ... you see that when the politicians lie. Like a politician who was sending sexual messages</a>
00:05:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h06m01s">One of the students: Anthony Weiner (name of politician)</a>
00:06:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h06m02s">Anthony Weiner is true! Perfect name for that person. That's funny...</a>
00:06:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h06m06s">I should not say this comment because it is obvious and clear, and yet it is funny.</a>
00:06:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h06m10s">But you know exactly what happened to him</a>
00:06:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h06m13s">Not the event itself</a>
00:06:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h06m17s">But people are stupid and make mistakes</a>
00:06:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h06m18s">And in fact, the public forgive mistakes, if you say</a>
00:06:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h06m22s">"Well, I am a fool how I did it but I did it. Because I will repeat it in the future."</a>
00:06:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h06m31s">But what is happening with the politicians</a>
00:06:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h06m33s">And I am not talking about the politicians specifically, but when they are mistaken, it appears immediately</a>
00:06:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h06m37s">And they lie 3 more lies to cover it up</a>
00:06:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h06m40s">This happened with the President of America Nixon, for example</a>
00:06:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h06m42s">And then it turned into a scandal</a>
00:06:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h06m45s">And they might get out of trouble from the start if they told the truth</a>
00:06:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h06m50s">They admitted, "Yes, I am an idiot and I will not repeat it again."</a>
00:06:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h06m56s">Well, that's not what happened with Pinocchio</a>
00:06:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h07m00s">He repeated his lies a lot until the blue fairy came and was generous with him because he is attractive and doll</a>
00:07:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h07m09s">She forgave him only this time and said to him: Do not do it again</a>
00:07:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23gRI_j5InA#t=00h07m17s">And she will not be there to help him in the future.</a>
