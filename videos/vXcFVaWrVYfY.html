<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h02m06s">of course! It's so...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h02m07s">You can have what you need in three years.</a>
00:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h02m11s">You gotta be careful with it</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h02m13s">you can't have everything. You can have what would be good for you, but you gotta figure out what that is</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h02m18s">and then you have to aim for it.</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h02m21s">Well, my experience with people is that if they figure out what it is that would be good for them and they aim</a>
00:02:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h02m26s">on there, they get it. And it's weird because,</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h02m30s">it's a strange thing, it's not that simple.</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h02m32s">Because, for example, you might formulate</a>
00:02:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h02m35s">an idea of ​​what would be good for you</a>
00:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h02m37s">and then you take ten steps to that and you see that your wording was not quite correct.</a>
00:02:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h02m41s">And then you have to reformulate your goal.</a>
00:02:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h02m42s">You go a little like that, as you move towards your goal.</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h02m46s">But a big reason people fail is because they have the</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h02m51s">never set criteria for success.</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h02m53s">And so, because success is such a narrow line and very unlikely, the chance that you will stumble across it</a>
00:02:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h03m00s">is zero!</a>
00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h03m01s">And so there's a suggestion here and the suggestion is, "If you really want something,</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h03m08s">then you can have it! "</a>
00:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h03m10s">The question then is: "What do you mean by really wanting?"</a>
00:03:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h03m16s">And the answer is that you reorient yourself, in every possible way,</a>
00:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h03m21s">so that the chance of that happening is as certain as possible.</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h03m26s">And that's an idea of ​​sacrifice, isn't it? It's like this: you don't get everything.</a>
00:03:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h03m30s">Of course not.</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h03m32s"> But maybe you can have what you need and maybe all you have to do to get it is ask for it.</a>
00:03:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h03m39s">But asking is not,</a>
00:03:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h03m41s">a fit or today's wish.</a>
00:03:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h03m44s">You have to be dead serious about it. You have to think, "Okay, I'm going to take inventory</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h03m50s">and if I would live appropriately in the world and I would set myself that way</a>
00:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h03m56s">so that existence would justify itself - in my opinion - and I don't mean like a merciless judge,</a>
00:03:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h04m02s">what exactly is it I would aim for? "</a>
00:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h04m02s">Well, one of the things I found was that ...</a>
00:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h04m08s">To test this theory,</a>
00:04:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h04m13s">you could try this. This is a form of praying - knocking - sit on your bed one day and ask yourself:</a>
00:04:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h04m22s">Which is - what incredibly stupid things I do regularly</a>
00:04:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h04m27s">to completely ruin my life? "</a>
00:04:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h04m29s">And if you actually ask yourself that question -</a>
00:04:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h04m31s">you have to want to know the answer, huh. Because that's what asking the question actually means.</a>
00:04:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h04m35s">It doesn't mean just saying the words, it means you have to decide you want to know.</a>
00:04:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h04m41s">You will find out so quickly, you will be amazed.</a>
00:04:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h04m46s">It's like...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h04m47s">Jung thought about this, he thought people had two poles of consciousness.</a>
00:04:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h04m51s">One was the consciousness of the individual that we all identify with.</a>
00:04:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h04m55s">And the other was something that he called [the Self], and the Self is the ...</a>
00:04:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h04m57s">You can see it as the divine within. That's a great approach.</a>
00:04:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h05m02s">It is the universal part of your consciousness. It's your conscience. You can see it that way.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h05m08s">Whatever your conscience may be. But it is something you can consult, it is like Socrates' daimon.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h05m18s">was that he consulted his inner daimon, his genius.</a>
00:05:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY#t=00h05m20s">He wondered exactly what it was like to behave</a>
