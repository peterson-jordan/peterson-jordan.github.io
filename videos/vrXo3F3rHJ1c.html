<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXo3F3rHJ1c#t=00h06m25s">There's nothing wrong with criticism, but the thing about criticism is the purpose of criticism is to separate the wheat from the chaff</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXo3F3rHJ1c#t=00h07m15s">Disrespectful towards that means to undermine the very structure that makes you not all of what you are certainly</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXo3F3rHJ1c#t=00h08m28s">It has something to do with respect</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXo3F3rHJ1c#t=00h09m13s">A pretty decent incarnation of the spirit of the Father that which I suppose is one of the things that makes Ham's</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXo3F3rHJ1c#t=00h09m27s">You know, it's not so bad</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXo3F3rHJ1c#t=00h09m36s">You know, I don't think it's pushing the limits of symbolic interpretation</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXo3F3rHJ1c#t=00h10m05s">and so one of the things that has really struck me hard, I would say about the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXo3F3rHJ1c#t=00h10m23s">And that's the spirit of separating the wheat from the chaff</a>
