00:00:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h00m25s">So you would ask that.</a>
00:00:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h00m27s">The question is...</a>

00:00:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h00m41s">and the answer to that is- it does.</a>
00:00:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h00m43s">There is only so many complications I can address in the talk simultaneously</a>
00:00:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h00m48s">umm.... if you look at</a>
00:00:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h00m50s">If you look at the most archaic of archetypal heroes</a>
00:00:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h00m53s">Those heroes confront something 
that represents chaos</a>
00:00:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h00m57s">It's usually a monster that bears a treasure of some sort</a>
00:00:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h01m00s">and that's a symbolic representation of the class of all unexplored things</a>
00:01:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h01m05s">because things that we have not yet explored are threatening and destructive</a>
00:01:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h01m09s">but also offer us infinite potential</a>
00:01:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h01m12s">but more elaborated hero stories, lets say</a>
00:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h01m15s">also reverse that and say that- well there are times when the order has become so corrupt and rigid</a>
00:01:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h01m20s">that free speech fragments it into its parts</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h01m22s">so that it can rejuvenate itself</a>
00:01:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h01m24s">and so...</a>
00:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h01m26s">actually in the gospels</a>
00:01:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h01m27s">that's the hero that Christ is basically represented as</a>
00:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h01m31s">He's not so much the dragon confronting...the dragon slayer who gathers the treasure</a>
00:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h01m37s">Although that's implicit in the juxtaposition of Christ with the figure of like a serpentile satan</a>
00:01:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h01m41s">but Christ is the thing that stands 
up against the corrupt state</a>
00:01:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h01m45s">and rejuvenates it through speech</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h01m48s">And so technically speaking</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h01m50s">free speech- the logos is the thing that mediates between chaos and order</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h01m54s">and you can think about</a>
00:01:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h01m56s">this is represented in many cultures- this idea</a>
00:01:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h01m58s">You can see it most specifically in the Taoist conceptualisation</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h02m03s">because in the Taoist world, being is made out of chaos and order, yin and yang, masculine and feminine</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h02m10s">fundamentally it's chaos and order</a>
00:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h02m12s">and order is the fact that wherever you go, there are things you understand</a>
00:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h02m16s">and chaos is- the fact that wherever you go, there are things that you don't understand</a>
00:02:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h02m20s">And so the idea is that being is made out of the things that you understand and the things that you don't understand</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h02m25s">and it's always that way</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h02m27s">which is why Tao is the symbol of being per se</a>
00:02:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h02m31s">and it's the case</a>

00:02:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h02m33s">it's partly why it has two hemispheres--</a>
00:02:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h02m36s">for the world that you understand, and the world you don't understand</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h02m38s">the world you understand, roughly speaking, being handled by the left</a>

00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h02m46s">Well it's that line down the middle that's Tao.  That's meaning.</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h02m51s">And if you have one foot in chaos and one foot in order, you're maximising information flow</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h02m56s">and rejuvenating yourself at the same time that you're maintaining your structure</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h03m00s">and you will report on that internally as engagement in the world.</a>
00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h03m05s">It's the most fundamental orienting sense that you have.</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h03m07s">and it's deeply instantiated neurologically--</a>
00:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h03m10s">unbelievably deeply.</a>
00:03:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h03m12s">And so it really is the case</a>
00:03:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h03m13s">from an evolutionary perspective</a>
00:03:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h03m15s">that reality is chaos and order.</a>
00:03:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h03m18s">It's that to which you're adapted.</a>
00:03:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h03m20s">And so sometimes you are speaking on behalf of chaos,</a>
00:03:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h03m23s">and sometimes you are speaking on behalf of order.</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h03m25s">It's more complicated than that too, though, because...</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h03m27s">when we have a dialogue, say,</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h03m30s">and we're mutually attempting

00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h03m33s">instead of convincing each other that we're right...</a>
00:03:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h03m36s">then what we are doing is engaging in the simultaneous fragmentation of old and archaic belief systems,</a>
00:03:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h03m43s">and they're updated.
And you can experience that--</a>
00:03:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h03m46s">because someone will say 
something that sets you back</a>
00:03:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h03m49s">and then you'll get what they're saying,

00:03:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h03m52s">And what you are experiencing is the death of an old conceptualisation structure</a>

00:03:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h04m03s">And people love that.  They live for that.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h04m08s">And you can experience that in a deep conversation,</a>
00:04:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h04m10s">a truthful conversation,

more natural state of being?</a>

00:07:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h07m30s">So, the question is-- the first was a comment about</a>
00:07:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h07m34s">the emphasis in my talk today on altruism</a>
00:07:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h07m37s">and the second is, "How do I--how do people overcome their proclivity to only act on their own behalf?"</a>
00:07:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h07m43s">OK, so ... the first thing I will say is that</a>
00:07:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h07m46s">I don't believe that what I spoke about today was in favor of altruism</a>
00:07:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h07m52s">And, that's not a negative comment on your question.</a>
00:07:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h07m57s">But there's ...   So here's a primary religious injunction:</a>
00:07:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h08m01s">Treat the other person like you would like to be treated yourself.</a>
00:08:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h08m05s">That does not mean "be nice to other people".</a>
00:08:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h08m08s">It does not mean "sacrifice yourself excessively for other people".</a>
00:08:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h08m14s">It means... Think about the other person as if they were YOU,</a>
00:08:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h08m18s">and figure out how you can mutually interact to better both of you at the same time.</a>
00:08:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h08m23s">You have to build yourself into the equation.</a>
00:08:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h08m26s">It's an equation.</a>
00:08:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h08m28s">It's not that others are more valuable,</a>
00:08:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h08m31s">it's that we're ALL valuable.  We're equally valuable.</a>
00:08:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h08m33s">And then you think "well, how do you remind yourself of that?"</a>
00:08:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h08m35s">And the answer to that is, through terror.</a>
00:08:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h08m39s">Because terror is the genuine motivator.</a>
00:08:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h08m41s">So they say--</a>
00:08:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h08m42s">"Fear of god is the beginning of all wisdom."</a>
00:08:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h08m45s">Well, what does that mean?</a>
00:08:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h08m47s">It means, first, that you don't get away with anything.</a>
00:08:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h08m50s">And it's really useful to know that, because if you really know that,</a>
00:08:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h08m54s">you won't TRY to get away with--</a>
00:08:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h08m56s">well, you still will--because people are stupid--but,</a>
00:08:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h08m57s"><strong>laughter</strong>
but at least it will mitigate the possibility.  So--</a>
00:08:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h09m02s">Here, I'll tell you something that Jung said.  This is quite profound.</a>
00:09:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h09m06s">And I think it's the right answer to this question.</a>
00:09:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h09m09s">Yung believed-- He was interested in the emergence of higher morality.</a>
00:09:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h09m14s">--something the developmental psychologist Piaget was also interested in--</a>
00:09:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h09m19s">Piaget thought... we started out as individuals, then we learned to play games with other people.</a>
00:09:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h09m23s">Kids--children--learned how to play games with other children, and that made them social.</a>
00:09:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h09m28s">So, our society is a game, it's a giant game.</a>
00:09:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h09m31s">That we're all playing together, voluntarily.</a>
00:09:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h09m34s">And so children will first learn how to play the game,</a>
00:09:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h09m37s">and only later did they learn the rules of the game.</a>
00:09:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h09m39s">They learned how to play the game first, and then learned the rules--how to SPEAK the rules.</a>
00:09:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h09m43s">And then at some point they realized that they were also creators of the rules.</a>
00:09:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h09m48s">And so that's ...</a>
00:09:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h09m50s">... moral development...</a>
00:09:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h09m52s">... on a continual-- or, not a continual... it's a fractured staircase upward.</a>
00:09:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h09m58s">But Jung was interested in</a>
00:09:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h09m59s">elements of moral action that were higher than that, so...</a>
00:09:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h10m02s">he conceptualized it symbolically.  So imagine this--</a>
00:10:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h10m06s">He did this in the last book he wrote, called "Mysterium Coniunctionis".</a>
00:10:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h10m11s">So imagine that</a>
00:10:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h10m13s">you exist so that your conceptual structures and your emotions are in uneasy relationship with one another.</a>
00:10:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UL-SdOhwek#t=00h10m17s">So you're kind of a house divided ... amongst yourself.</a>
