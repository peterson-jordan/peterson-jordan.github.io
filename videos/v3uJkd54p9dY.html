<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h00m32s">the psychoanalysts. Because the thinkers we're about to discuss, with some exceptions ...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h00m50s">or thinkers themselves who influenced Freud and Jung.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h00m53s">So there is an intellectual continuity ... in people who are very learned</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h01m02s">and very thoughtful, there is an intellectual continuity of ideas that stretches across</a>
00:01:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h01m08s">very long periods.</a>
00:01:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h01m10s">Such a ratio is exactly what you would expect.</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h01m16s">Rogers was influenced by several people, such as Freud, Jung and Adler,</a>
00:01:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h01m22s">but he was also strongly influenced by phenomenological ideas.</a>
00:01:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h01m26s">And the phenomenologists were, and are ... phenomenology is a form of philosophy that I'll expand on.</a>
00:01:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h01m38s">And the other major sphere of influence for Rogers was probably Christianity,</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h01m44s">Christianity through Northern European culture, as far as I can tell.</a>
00:01:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h01m51s">I mention Christianity when it comes to Rogers</a>
00:01:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h01m55s">because as a young man he was a fundamentalist Christian, and a seminarian.</a>
00:01:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h02m01s">He was quite strongly oriented towards Orthodox Protestant Christianity, but then he</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h02m08s">was in college, he had a crisis of faith.</a>
00:02:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h02m12s">At one point he would even go to China as a missionary.</a>
00:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h02m16s">But he had a crisis of faith in college because he was also scientifically trained.</a>
00:02:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h02m21s">His father was a farmer who used fairly advanced techniques, so Rogers was trained</a>
00:02:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h02m28s">to think scientifically, from a very young age.</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h02m30s">And he experienced the conflict between his religious beliefs and his scientific assumptions quite intensely,</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h02m35s">and in that battle his formal Christian faith was defeated.</a>
00:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h02m43s">However, his ideas have been strongly influenced by fundamentalist Protestant assumptions,</a>
00:02:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h02m49s">and I will describe the consequences of this when we review Rogers' ideas.</a>
00:02:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h02m59s">It is important to understand the philosophical foundation of a personality theory or psychology,</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h03m08s">for every theory is connected with a number of assumptions. Things you must</a>
00:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h03m19s">assume they are true, in order to proceed with a theory.</a>
00:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h03m22s">Like the axioms in classical geometry.</a>
00:03:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h03m27s">You cannot prove the axioms, you have to accept them.</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h03m29s">Once you have accepted the axioms, you can move on and use the whole system.</a>
00:03:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h03m33s">I think systems should have axioms, elements of belief,</a>
00:03:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h03m39s">because every system is incomplete.</a>
00:03:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h03m41s">It doesn't cover everything.</a>
00:03:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h03m44s">In a sense you need a place where you can suspend your ignorance,</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h03m49s">and you do that by assuming things.</a>
00:03:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h03m51s">We are going to act as if the following is true.</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h03m56s">Then you can continue with a partial theory and make progress with it.</a>
00:03:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h04m00s">But it is useful to understand the assumptions, because that makes for a good positioning with respect to the theory.</a>
00:04:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h04m07s">Rogers is a phenomenologist, and phenomenology is a form of philosophy</a>
00:04:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h04m14s">which started with Edmund Husserl, but which was most influenced by his student Martin Heidegger.</a>
00:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h04m24s">Heidegger was a philosopher, somewhat similar to Nietzsche because of his thinking</a>
00:04:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h04m34s">very strongly against what you can call general academic philosophy.</a>
00:04:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h04m40s">For example, Heidegger thought that since the time of Plato, where one is usually the beginning</a>
00:04:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h04m47s">of philosophy, Western philosophy had gone in the wrong direction.</a>
00:04:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h04m54s">She had been too preoccupied with the nature of the structures of thought, and not so much with</a>
00:04:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h05m00s">the nature of being.</a>
00:05:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h05m03s">You can distinguish those two things.</a>
00:05:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h05m05s">Being is how things are, and thinking is how you represent things.</a>
00:05:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h05m10s">And one of Heidegger's spearheads was to make being the center of philosophy again.</a>
00:05:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h05m22s">That leads to the question, "What is being?"</a>
00:05:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h05m28s">Conceptualizing reality as being is not the same way of conceptualizing</a>
00:05:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h05m36s">as you do in the terms of modern Western thinking. Because one of the basic assumptions</a>
00:05:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h05m47s">of modern western thinking, that is the most intelligent way to divide the world,</a>
00:05:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h05m54s">in terms of subjective and objective experience, or subjective experience and objective world.</a>
00:05:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h06m03s">So the basic scientific assumption is that there is an objective world,</a>
00:06:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h06m10s">that's what's real.</a>
00:06:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h06m13s">You achieve this by performing certain procedures, documenting them, describing the results thereof,</a>
00:06:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h06m18s">document that, and then have other people do the same.</a>
00:06:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h06m24s">Assuming that if they find the same outcomes, from those procedures,</a>
00:06:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h06m29s">that their experience is then real.</a>
00:06:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h06m31s">That is, in fact, the scientific method.</a>
00:06:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h06m34s">Method.</a>
00:06:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h06m35s">Results.</a>
00:06:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h06m36s">You specify the method, how you act, and you get results.</a>
00:06:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h06m38s">You compare them, maybe with different observations you make, and other people make different observations,</a>
00:06:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h06m44s">you form a consensus, but that is a consensus tied to a method.</a>
00:06:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h06m49s">And then you abstract general principles based on that, and that works very well.</a>
00:06:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h06m53s">Make no mistake.</a>
00:06:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h06m57s">The idea that there is an objective external world, and that that is the best way to conceptualize reality,</a>
00:06:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h07m01s">is an incredibly powerful tool.</a>
00:07:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h07m06s">Whether that is an accurate description of reality ... that is a much more complex question.</a>
00:07:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h07m13s">Actually it is a matter of definition.</a>
00:07:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h07m18s">There are different shapes in geometry, you may know that.</a>
00:07:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h07m22s">You can start with the assumption that reality has a three-dimensional structure.</a>
00:07:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h07m27s">Then you are in the domain of Euclidean geometry. But you can also start</a>
00:07:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h07m32s">with the assumption that reality has a four-dimensional structure.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=00h27m56s">So that's a bit confusing terminologically.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJkd54p9dY#t=01h14m50s">Jung noticed that too. Much of what you do during psychotherapy,</a>
