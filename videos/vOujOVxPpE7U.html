<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h00m30s">You take a leap forward, and you learn some things,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h01m29s">I'm gonna speak about men here because I - I've - observed it more in men, is</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h01m34s">That they often stay under the thumb of their father, and you think well</a>
00:01:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h01m40s">Why would someone do that? Because it means they're subject to the tyrannical judgment of their father,</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h01m45s">They're always concerned about what their father would think or whether their father approves of him - of them - and so forth</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h01m51s">And you think, well, that's got to be an unpleasant place to be. Why would you</a>
00:01:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h01m57s">Do that?</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h01m59s">one of the things that I've</a>
00:01:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h02m01s">Suggested to my clients, and to other people sometimes, is that - here's a weird little exercise that you can undertake, a little thought</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h02m08s">experiment.</a>
00:02:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h02m10s">So, you have your parents, and of course your parents have friends who are about their age.</a>
00:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h02m15s">And maybe some of them are people you only know peripherally and I might ask you well</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h02m21s">do you care more about what your parents think than you care about what these peripheral people who know your parents think? And</a>
00:02:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h02m27s">Then the answer to that is well of course and then the question that arises out of that is</a>
00:02:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h02m34s">Why?</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h02m36s">I mean, for someone else, your parents are the peripheral people and their parents are central like why is it logical that your parents make -</a>
00:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h02m45s">opinion makes any more difference to you than the appearance - than the, uh -</a>
00:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h02m49s">The opinion of some randomly selected people who are approximately that age?</a>
00:02:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h02m54s">Why is it the case that you would consider that they would know more than someone else?</a>
00:02:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h02m58s">I mean I know they know you better, and fair enough, but that that's not the point. And</a>
00:02:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h03m03s">then another point there is that, to the degree that your parents' opinion about you matters more than some randomly selected people of</a>
00:03:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h03m11s">Approximately the same age. Jung would say well you haven't exactly</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h03m15s">Separated out the God image from your parents, and so you're still under that - that - combination</a>
00:03:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h03m21s">It's like, it's a complicated thing to talk about, but think about the Harry Potter</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h03m27s">Series. Harry has two sets of parents, right?</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h03m30s">He's got the Dursley parents [They're actually his aunt and uncle, Dr. Peterson, but continue], and then he's got these like magical parents that sort of float behind</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h03m34s">And he should know the difference between them. They shouldn't be one in the same. They're not for him. And</a>
00:03:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h03m40s">It's like well you have your parents and you have nature and culture as parents</a>
00:03:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h03m44s">And you shouldn't be thinking that your parents are nature and culture as well</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h03m47s">They shouldn't have final dominion over you. That means that you're not an individual yet if that's the case. Freud said, for example, that no</a>
00:03:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h03m55s">No, no one could be a man unless his father had died. And Jung said yes, but that death can take place symbolically</a>
00:03:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h04m03s">Okay, so there's that part of the idea, and then another part of the idea is</a>
00:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h04m09s">One of the times in your life when you actually realize that you're an individual is when you'll go and ask your parents something and</a>
00:04:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h04m16s">You'll realize they actually don't know any more about</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h04m19s">What you should do than you do, and that sucks and</a>
00:04:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h04m23s">That's partly why people are often willing to maintain a tyrant-slave relationship with their father. It's like on the one hand you have to be</a>
00:04:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h04m31s">inferior in a relationship like that</a>
00:04:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h04m33s">You know, you've always got the judge watching you. But, on the other hand, there's always someone who knows what to do.</a>
00:04:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h04m39s">There's always someone standing between you and the unknown that you can go ask. What should I do? Well, at some point,</a>
00:04:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h04m45s">You'll realize that the reason you can't ask that anymore is because they actually don't know anymore than you do</a>
00:04:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h04m50s">And then that's a pain like that - that - is a symbolic death</a>
00:04:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h04m54s">That's also when you establish a more individual relationship with your parents</a>
00:04:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h04m59s">It's at that point that you could conceivably start taking care of them instead of the reverse and that's a time that should come</a>
00:04:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h05m05s">But you have to let that image of perfection go, and that exposes you. Well, that's what happens here</a>
00:05:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h05m12s">You know Pinocchio goes home?</a>
00:05:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h05m13s">And he wants things to be the way they were and he wants to stay under the careful care of the benevolent father</a>
00:05:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h05m21s">but</a>
00:05:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h05m22s">That's no longer possible. He's past that point and that's why the father has disappeared and so</a>
00:05:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h05m29s">Geppetto has gone off to look for Pinocchio because he also needs his son, but</a>
00:05:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h05m34s">But in any case the house is abandoned and so then</a>
00:05:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h05m38s">There we see inside the house that everything's covered with cobwebs and everything's gone and Pinocchio and the cricket sit on the steps</a>
00:05:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h05m45s">And they're very concerned. First of all, they wonder where he went so they're actually concerned that he's gone</a>
00:05:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h05m50s">But they also don't know what to do because there's just no going home</a>
00:05:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h05m53s">And so you know that's also the case that once you hit a certain point in your development</a>
00:05:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h06m00s">Well, it's the same thing we already talked about</a>
00:06:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h06m02s">The answers that you're looking for are not going to be found in your parents' house. It's as simple as that. Now, you could artificially</a>
00:06:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h06m09s">maintain your</a>
00:06:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h06m10s">Dependency, but, you know, if you do that for too long things get pretty ugly</a>
00:06:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujOVxPpE7U#t=00h06m16s">So you get pretty stale and - and - you know, you're like bread that's been on the shelf for too long.</a>
