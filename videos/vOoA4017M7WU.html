<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h00m50s">And so, the questions are something like, well:</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h00m53s">"Alright, you're gonna have to put some effort into your life.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h00m56s">And you need to be motivated to do that."</a>
00:00:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h00m59s">And so, what are the potential sources of motivation?</a>
00:00:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h01m01s">Well, you could think about them
in the Big Five manner, you know,</a>
00:01:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h01m05s">1) if you're extroverted, you want friends,</a>
00:01:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h01m06s">2) if you're agreeable, you want an intimate relationship,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h01m08s">3) if you're disagreeable, you want to win competitions,</a>
00:01:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h01m11s">4) if you're open, you want to engage in creative activity,</a>
00:01:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h01m14s">5) if you're high in neuroticism, you want security.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h01m16s">Okay, so those are all sources of potential motivation,</a>
00:01:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h01m19s">that you could draw on, that you could tailor to
your own, you know, your own personality.</a>
00:01:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h01m23s">But then there are dimensions,
that you wanna consider your life across.</a>
00:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h01m26s">And so, we asked people about, well...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h01m29s">"You know, if you could have your life
the way you wanted it, in 3 to 5 years,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h01m32s">if you were taking care of yourself properly, you know:</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h01m34s">[Dr. Peterson lists the dimensions]
1) What would you want from your friendships?
2) What would you want from your intimate relationship?</a>
00:01:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h01m38s">3) How would you like to structure your family?
4) What do you want for your career?</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h01m41s">5) How are you going to use your time outside of your job?</a>
00:01:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h01m45s">And 6) How are you going to regulate your
mental, physical- mental and physical health?</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h01m48s">And maybe also 7) Your drug and alcohol use."</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h01m50s">Because that's- that's a good place to auger down.</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h01m52s">You know, cause alcoholism for example,
wipes out, you know, 5-10% of people.</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h01m56s">So, you wanna keep that under control.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h02m03s">You develop a vision, of what your life-

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h02m12s">and then you break down the goal into
microprocesses, that you can implement,</a>
00:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h02m16s">the microprocesses become rewarding, in proportion...
in relation to their, uh, causal association with the goal!</a>
00:02:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h02m24s">And that tangles in your- your incentive reward system, you know.</a>
00:02:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h02m28s">We talked about the "dopaminergic incentive reward system",
and that's the thing that keeps you moving forward.</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h02m32s">And the way it works, is that it works better,</a>
00:02:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h02m35s">if it produces positive emotion,
when it can see you moving towards a valued goal.</a>
00:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h02m40s">Okay well, what's the implication of that?
- Better have a valued goal!</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h02m44s">Because otherwise, you can't get any
positive motivation working out.</a>
00:02:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h02m48s">And so, the more valuable the goal, in principle,</a>
00:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h02m50s">the more the microprocesses associated
with that goal, start to take on a positive charge.</a>
00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h02m56s">And so, what that means is, well...</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h02m57s">You get up in the morning, and you're
excited about the day, you're ready to go.</a>
00:02:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h03m00s">And so, as far as I can tell, what you do is:
you specify your long term ideal.</a>
00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h03m06s">Maybe you also specify a place you wanna stay the hell away from,</a>
00:03:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h03m09s">so that you're terrified to fail,
as well as excited about succeeding,</a>
00:03:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h03m12s">cause that's also useful.</a>
00:03:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h03m14s">You specify your goal. You do that,
in some sense, as a unique individual.</a>
00:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h03m20s">You wanna specify goals, that make you say:</a>
00:03:20</p>

of my efforts, it would clearly be worthwhile!"</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h03m28s">Because, the question always is: Why do something?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h03m31s">Cause doing nothing is easy.
You just sit there, and you don't do anything.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h03m33s">That's real easy.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h03m35s">The question is, why would you ever do anything?</a>
00:03:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h03m37s">And the answer that has to be:
Because you've determined, by some means, that it's worthwhile!</a>
00:03:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h03m42s">And then, the next question might be:
Well, where should you look for worthwhile things?</a>
00:03:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h03m46s">And one would be:
Well, you could consult your own temperament!</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h03m49s">And the other would be:

00:04:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h04m31s">So, but once you set up that goal structure, let's say,</a>
00:04:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h04m35s">and that's really, in many ways, that's what
you should be doing at universities.</a>
00:04:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h04m39s">That's exactly what you should be doing - is trying to figure out:
Who it is, that you're trying to be?</a>
00:04:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h04m45s">Right? And you aim at that.</a>
00:04:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h04m48s">And then use everything you learn, as a means of
building that person that you wanna be, and...</a>
00:04:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h04m53s">I really mean "want to be!" I don't mean "should be",
even those things- those things are gonna overlap.</a>
00:04:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h04m59s">And it's important to distinguish between those,
because that's partly</a>
00:04:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h05m02s">(and this is back down to the micro-routine analysis),</a>
00:05:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h05m04s">so, if I say-
Well, you gonna try to make yourself more industrious,</a>
00:05:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h05m07s">Okay, #1: Specify your damn goals.</a>
00:05:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h05m09s">Cause how are you gonna hit something,
if you don't know what it is?</a>
00:05:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h05m11s">That isn't gonna happen!</a>
00:05:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h05m13s">And often people won't specify their goals too,
cause they don't like to specify conditions for failure.</a>
00:05:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h05m18s">So, if you keep yourself all vague and foggy,</a>
00:05:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h05m20s">which is real easy, because that's
just a matter of not doing as well,</a>
00:05:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h05m23s">then you don't know when you fail!</a>
00:05:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h05m25s">And people might say: "Well, I really don't wanna
know when I fail, because that's painful!</a>
00:05:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h05m29s">So I'll keep myself blind, about when I fail!"</a>
00:05:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h05m32s">That's fine, except you'll fail all the time then!</a>
00:05:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h05m34s">Just won't know it until you
failed so badly, that you're done.</a>
00:05:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h05m38s">And that can easily happen by the time you're 40.</a>
00:05:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h05m41s">So, so... I would recommend that you don't let that happen.</a>
00:05:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h05m45s">So that's willful blindness, right?
You could have known!</a>
00:05:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h05m47s">But you chose not to.</a>
00:05:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h05m49s">Okay, so once you get your goal structure set up, you think:</a>
00:05:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h05m51s">Okay, if I could have this life,
looks like that might be worth living".</a>
00:05:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h05m55s">Despite the fact that it's gonna be, you know,
anxiety provoking and threatening,</a>
00:05:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h05m59s">and there's gonna be some suffering
and loss involved, in all of that.</a>
00:05:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h06m02s">Obviously.</a>
00:06:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h06m03s">The goal is to have a vision for your life, such that -</a>
00:06:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h06m07s">- all things considered, that justifies your effort.</a>
00:06:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h06m11s">Okay, so then what do you do?</a>
00:06:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h06m13s">Well, then - then you turn down to the micro-routine.</a>
00:06:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h06m16s">It's like "Okay well, this is what I'm aiming for.</a>
00:06:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h06m18s">How does that instantiate itself,
day to day, week to week, month to month?</a>
00:06:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h06m22s">And that's where something like a
schedule, can be unbelievably useful.</a>
00:06:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h06m26s">Google Calendar.
It's like, make a damn schedule!</a>
00:06:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h06m29s">And stick to it!</a>
00:06:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h06m30s">Okay, so what's the rule with the schedule?
It's not a bloody prison!</a>
00:06:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h06m34s">That's the first thing, that people do wrong!
It's like "Well I don't like to follow a schedule".</a>
00:06:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h06m38s">It's like: "Well, what kind of schedule are you setting up?"</a>
00:06:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h06m41s">"Well, I sh- I have to do this,
then I have to do this, then I have to do this.</a>
00:06:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h06m44s">You know, and then I just go play video games,</a>
00:06:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h06m46s">because who wants to do all these things, that I have to do?"</a>
00:06:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h06m48s">It's like, WRONG!</a>
00:06:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h06m50s">Set the damn schedule up.</a>
00:06:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h06m52s">So that you have the day you want!</a>
00:06:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h06m54s">That's the trick! It's like
"Okay, I've got tomorrow,</a>
00:06:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h06m57s">if I was gonna set it up, so it's
the best possible day I could have,</a>
00:06:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h07m01s">practically speaking, what would it look like?"</a>
00:07:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h07m05s">Well, then you schedule that!</a>
00:07:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h07m06s">And obviously, there's a bit of responsibility
that's gonna go along with that,</a>
00:07:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h07m09s">because if you have any sense, one of the things that you're gonna insist upon,</a>
00:07:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h07m13s">is that at the end of the day, you're not in worse shape
than you were at the beginning of the day, right?</a>
00:07:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h07m19s">Cause that's a stupid day!</a>
00:07:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h07m21s">If you have a bunch of those in a row,
you just dig, you know,</a>
00:07:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h07m23s">you dig yourself a hole, and then you bury yourself in it!</a>
00:07:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h07m25s">In it's like - sorry, that's just not a good strategy.</a>
00:07:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h07m28s">It's a bad strategy.</a>
00:07:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h07m29s">So, maybe 20% of your day
has to be responsibility and obligation.</a>
00:07:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h07m34s">Or maybe it's more than that,
depending on how far behind you are.</a>
00:07:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h07m37s">But even that, you can ask yourself:</a>
00:07:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h07m39s">"Okay well, I've got these responsibilities,
I have to schedule the damn things in,</a>
00:07:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h07m44s">what's the right ratio of responsibility to reward?"</a>
00:07:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h07m47s">And you can ask yourself that, just like you'd
negotiate with someone, who is working for you.</a>
00:07:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h07m51s">It's like - okay, you gotta work tomorrow.</a>
00:07:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h07m53s">Okay, so "I want you to work tomorrow".</a>
00:07:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h07m55s">And you might say:
"Okay well, what are you gonna do for me,</a>
00:07:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h07m58s">that makes it likely, that I'll work for you?"</a>
00:07:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h08m00s">Well, you could ask yourself that, you know.</a>
00:08:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h08m02s">Maybe you do an hour of responsibility,
and then you play a video game for 15 minutes.</a>
00:08:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h08m07s">I don't know, whatever turns your crank, man.</a>
00:08:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h08m09s">But you know, you have to negotiate with yourself,
and not tyrannize yourself!</a>
00:08:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h08m14s">Like you're negotiating with someone that you care for,</a>
00:08:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h08m17s">that you would like to be productive and have a good life!</a>
00:08:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h08m20s">And and that's how you make the schedule, it's like ...</a>
00:08:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h08m22s">And then you look at the day, and you think:
"Well if I had that day, that'd be good".</a>
00:08:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h08m25s">Great!</a>
00:08:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h08m26s">You know, and you're useless and horrible, so you'll probably only hit it with about 70% accuracy.</a>
00:08:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h08m31s">But that beats the hell out of zero!</a>
00:08:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h08m34s">Right? And if you hit it even with 50% accuracy,</a>
00:08:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h08m37s">another rule is:
Well, aim for 51% the next week,</a>
00:08:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h08m41s">or 50.5%, for God's sake, or...</a>
00:08:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h08m43s">Because you're gonna hit that position, where things
start to loop back positively, and spiral you upward!</a>
00:08:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h08m51s">And so...</a>
00:08:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h08m52s">So that's one way, that you can work on your conscientious.</a>
00:08:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h08m55s">Plan of life, you'd like to have!</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h08m57s">And- and you do that partly by referring to social norms,</a>
00:08:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h09m01s">that's more or less rescuing your father from the belly of the whale,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h09m04s">but the other way you do that, is by having
a little conversation with yourself, about...</a>
00:09:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h09m09s">As if you don't really know who you are.
Because you know what you're like, you won't do what you're told.</a>
00:09:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h09m13s">You won't do, what you tell yourself to do.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h09m16s">You must have noticed THAT!</a>
00:09:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h09m18s">It's like, you're a bad employee, and a worse boss.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h09m21s">And both of those work... you know, for you.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h09m24s">You don't know what you wanna do, and then when
you tell yourself what to do, you don't do it anyways.</a>
00:09:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h09m27s">You should fire yourself, and find someone else to be, but...</a>
00:09:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h09m31s">But, you know, my point is, is that you have to understand,
that you're not your own servant, so to speak.</a>
00:09:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h09m36s">You're someone that you have to negotiate with,
and that's, and y-</a>
00:09:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h09m39s">You're someone, that you want to present the opportunity of having a good life to!</a>
00:09:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h09m44s">And that's hard for people, cause
they don't like themselves very much!</a>
00:09:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h09m48s">So you know, they're always like cracking the whip and then procrastinating,</a>
00:09:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h09m52s">and cracking the whip, and then procrastinating.</a>
00:09:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h09m53s">And it's like - God, it's so boring,
and such a pathetic way of spending your time.</a>
00:09:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h09m58s">And you know what that's like,
cause you probably waste like 6 hours a day.</a>
00:09:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h10m01s">And I think, we did an economic calculation about that a while back, right?</a>
00:10:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h10m04s">Your time is probably worth 50 bucks an hour.
Something like that.</a>
00:10:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h10m07s">I mean, you're not getting paid that now, but you're young,</a>
00:10:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h10m10s">and so this is investment time,</a>
00:10:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h10m12s">and what you do now, is going to multiply its effects in the future.</a>
00:10:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h10m16s">So... so let's say it's $50 an hour,
which is perfectly reasonable.</a>
00:10:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h10m19s">So if you waste 6 hours a day, and you are,</a>
00:10:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h10m22s">Then you're wasting about $2,000 a week,
or about $100,000 a year.</a>
00:10:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h10m25s">So like, go ahead!
But that's what it's costing you, every hour.</a>
00:10:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h10m29s">And you need to know,
what your damn time is worth.</a>
00:10:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h10m31s">So, let's say it's not 50 bucks, it's 30.</a>
00:10:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h10m34s">Whatever, maybe it's a $100.
It's somewhere in that range.</a>
00:10:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h10m37s">One of the things you should be asking yourself is,
when you spend an hour, was that "Well,</a>
00:10:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h10m41s">would've I paid someone 50 bucks,
to have had that hour?"</a>
00:10:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h10m45s">And if the answer is "no", it's like:
Well, maybe you should do something else with your time.</a>
00:10:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h10m49s">And it depends on whether or not
you think that your time is worth while.</a>
00:10:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h10m53s">But the funny thing about not assuming that,
is if you assume your time isn't worthwhile,</a>
00:10:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h10m57s">what happens, is you don't just sit around sorta
randomly, in a state of responsibility-less bliss.</a>
00:10:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h11m03s">What you do, is you suffer existentially.</a>
00:11:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoA4017M7WU#t=00h11m05s">And so... that seems like a stupid solution.</a>
