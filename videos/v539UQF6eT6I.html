<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=00h02m09s">the most important of which was probably the emergence of the scientific worldview.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=00h02m17s">And as I explained in the previous lecture, both Dostoevsky and Nietzsche believed that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=00h03m27s">in evolved systems of meaning, which are more profound than that which is articulated and explicit.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=00h03m34s">And if there is a period of very rapid cognitive and technological change,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=00h03m42s">then the integrity of those systems starts ... it gets questionable</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=00h03m57s">An example that you can consider is the introduction of the contraceptive pill.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=00h04m16s">was essentially a political issue, but I don't think it's very reasonable to do it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=00h04m21s">in that way.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=00h06m00s">In thirty years to fifty years, there will be nine billion people on the earth, and that will be the culmination.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=00h06m06s">Then it will decrease sharply, and you can see how that is happening right now,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=00h06m14s">where there are more old people than young people.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=00h06m18s">Because the young people don't have enough children to replace the population.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=00h06m23s">So the likelihood that it will peak at around nine billion, and then decline ...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=00h06m28s">it is not certain, but that is what the best predictions seem to indicate.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=00h39m46s">as the existential answer to the revelation of the absence of meaning,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h12m11s">You detect meaning before you detect an object, because you have to detect meaning</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h12m18s">to know what to do if something happens very quickly. There are moments</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h12m23s">to which you need to be able to respond, without having enough time to see,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h12m26s">what is there.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h12m27s">You just don't have time for it. The question is:</a>
01:12:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h12m32s">what exactly do you mean by meaning?</a>
01:12:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h12m34s">I think meaning is relevance to behavior, or relevance to the structure that defines behavior,</a>
01:12:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h12m39s">but those are very basic observations.</a>
01:12:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h12m44s">It is not that you see the object and then format the meaning.</a>
01:12:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h12m47s">It's the other way around, in many cases.</a>
01:12:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h12m50s">You perceive the meaning and abstract the object. And there is enough neurophysiological evidence for that.</a>
01:12:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h12m56s">For example, your retina is a pattern detector, and the information</a>
01:12:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h13m03s">from your retina is passed to your brain through the facial nerve, but the facial nerve branches</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h13m08s">and goes to all kinds of places in your body.</a>
01:13:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h13m10s">Some of it is mapped onto your spinal cord so your eyes can move your body.</a>
01:13:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h13m15s">Some of it is mapped onto your amygdala so that you perceive the meaning of facial expressions,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h13m20s">without even seeing the face.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h13m22s">There are people with "blind vision," with a damaged visual cortex, who see you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h13m26s">can show angry faces that they cannot see, but they respond electrophysiologically to them</a>
01:13:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h13m33s">as if they were confronted with something negative. Because the pattern on the retina</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h13m38s">manifests itself directly on a system that maps some form of meaning.</a>
01:13:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h13m43s">So you can perceive meaning without perceiving an object. The idea that you</a>

01:13:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h13m52s">is correct on some levels of analysis, but incorrect on many other levels of analysis.</a>
01:13:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h13m59s">Something else to try that is phenomenologically inspired ...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h14m09s">This can be difficult for you, so be careful when trying this.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h14m12s">What you can try is to observe what you say for two weeks.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h14m17s">You have to detach yourself again.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h14m19s">You must suspend the belief that your thoughts and you are the same.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h14m30s">Then you observe what you say, and watch ...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h14m36s">and Rogers would advocate this too ... you have to watch what you say, your feeling ...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h14m41s">you have to see if what you say improves or deteriorates the quality of your life.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h15m31s">the word "phenomenon" comes from the Greek word "phainesthai." And phainesthai means</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h16m05s">One of the phenomenologists, Binswanger, would say that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h16m10s">that's because of the way I'm structured. But Boss would say, "No, it's a dance,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539UQF6eT6I#t=01h16m29s">it's something that guides me, that sense of meaning. I often find something</a>
