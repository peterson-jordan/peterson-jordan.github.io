this lecture in particular makes me nervous</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h01m15s">more than any of the other ones I do, because
I’ve been telling you a story that’s basically</a>
00:01:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h01m20s">40 hours long, right, and its spoken forum,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h01m26s">And it’s complicated to pull it together
properly.</a>
00:01:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h01m30s">And that’s partly because, as far as I’ve
been concerned, we’ve been talking about</a>
00:01:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h01m34s">issues in psychology that are more difficult

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h01m38s">First of all, conceptually, even from a neuropsychological
perspective, because I’ve been offering</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h01m47s">And I think it reflects the current state
of neuroscience.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h01m51s">And - but more than that, there’s the problem
that we’ve been dealing with issues all</a>
00:01:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h01m55s">the way along of life and death, and of war

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h02m01s">clear-headed optimism, right?
and possibility which, as we’ve discussed,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h02m06s">more or less escaped Tolstoy, say, for most
of his life, right, because when Tolstoy woke</a>
00:02:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h02m10s">up from his delusions, he looked at the world
and he said: Well, clearly it’s such a terrible</a>
00:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h02m16s">place that, if you’re not looking at it
through the veils of illusion, there’s no</a>
00:02:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h02m22s">way that you can do anything but stand in
opposition to it once you understand its basic</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h02m27s">structure, right?</a>
00:02:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h02m28s">Suffering and innocence suffering, and complete
vulnerability, and the whole existential mess</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h02m34s">that makes up life.</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h02m35s">Now it turns out that Tolstoy overcame his
rationally induced cynicism in a kind of mystical</a>
00:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h02m45s">way.</a>
00:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h02m48s">He had a dream that he was suspended from
some transcendent space by a belt around the</a>
00:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h02m53s">middle of his waist, which hung him over a
pit of chaos.</a>
00:02:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h02m56s">And in that image, he found comfort.</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h02m59s">And fair enough, it’s a powerful image.</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h03m01s">But it’s not well delineated, right?</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h03m04s">And it worked well for Tolstoy, and you can
see that the image has power, but you can’t--</a>
00:03:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h03m09s">you can’t grab it with your rational mind.</a>
00:03:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h03m11s">You can’t take it into pieces and analyze
it as an argument.</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h03m13s">And that’s what we do if we’re intellectuals,
right?</a>
00:03:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h03m16s">We try to understand the detailed structure
of something.</a>
00:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h03m21s">And I think the detailed structure of what
Tolstoy apprehended as optimistic is actually</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h03m28s">comprehensible.</a>
00:03:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h03m29s">And we’ve been working towards that and
circling around it the entire course of this</a>
00:03:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h03m36s">lecture series.</a>
00:03:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h03m38s">But I have found with this material that with
each circling around the target, it gets clearer</a>
00:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h03m42s">and clearer.</a>
00:03:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h03m43s">It’s a funny thing.</a>
00:03:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h03m44s">It’s like you’re looking at something
that’s too complicated to see all at once.</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h03m49s">So you have to look at it from multiple different
perspectives, and again and again.</a>
00:03:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h03m52s">And each time you look at it, it becomes clearer
and clearer.</a>
00:03:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h03m55s">And that’s still the case for me when I
go through this material.</a>
00:03:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h03m58s">Every time I go through it, I think: Oh yeah,
that piece fits there.</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h04m00s">And that piece fits there.</a>
00:04:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h04m01s">And that’s how that makes sense.</a>
00:04:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h04m03s">And: Oh that’s a lot more remarkable than
I thought it was to begin with… and so on.</a>
00:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h04m07s">And it seems fundamentally inexhaustible.</a>
00:04:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h04m08s">And of course, that’s what you’d expect
from deep, deep stories, right?</a>
00:04:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h04m13s">Stories that have been around for thousands
and thousands of years, wouldn’t have been</a>
00:04:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h04m16s">around for thousands and thousands of years
unless they were in some sense inexhaustible.</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h04m21s">And we’ve talked about some of the processes
that might contribute to that inexhaustibility.</a>
00:04:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h04m27s">So at the beginning of the lecture series,
I told you to consider the assumption that</a>
00:04:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h04m32s">there was more than one way of looking at
the world, right?</a>
00:04:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h04m35s">There was the standard materialist sort of
scientific viewpoint, which was that the world</a>
00:04:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h04m40s">was made up of objects – independently existent,
as among them - the objects have no intrinsic</a>
00:04:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h04m46s">value, one way or another.</a>
00:04:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h04m48s">And the issue of meaning per se wasn’t included
in that account.</a>
00:04:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h04m54s">And then I said: Well wait, there’s another
way of looking at the world, that we spent</a>
00:04:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h04m57s">just as much time developing, that we utilize
even more, and that’s the narrative…</a>
00:04:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h05m02s">That’s the narrative way of looking at the
world; to consider the nature of experience</a>
00:05:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h05m08s">rather than the nature of objects as real;
to consider your experience as real, even</a>
00:05:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h05m13s">though it includes things that can’t be
easily and tangibly identified – things</a>
00:05:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h05m17s">like emotions, which of course you find compelling,
sometimes even beyond your will.</a>
00:05:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h05m22s">Things like motivational states, fantasies,
ideals, all the things that compel your behaviour</a>
00:05:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h05m29s">and give you some sense that there’s a direction
to life.</a>
00:05:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h05m33s">people who study emotion and perception have
come to understand that the act of transforming</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h05m39s">the world into something simply made out of
objects is incredibly difficult.</a>
00:05:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h05m43s">It’s so difficult that we haven’t been
able to design machines that can do it at</a>
00:05:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h05m46s">all.</a>
00:05:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h05m47s">It turns out also that when we look at the
world, we’re not just looking at it with</a>
00:05:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h05m50s">our visual systems, but we’re looking at
it with our motor output systems and our emotions.</a>
00:05:50</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h09m43s">It turns out that silica has those properties,
and we can build unbelievably powerful machines</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h09m54s">about just what this nothing that we’re

00:09:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h09m58s">Because it seems to be able to reveal a constant

00:10:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h10m19s">And we know, even from a strict object perception
of the world that the stuff that things are</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h10m25s">made of is a lot more complicated than we

00:10:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h10m29s">because materialists, realists, their philosophy
only holds down to about the subatomic level</a>
00:10:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h10m38s">of analysis – a deterministic worldview.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h10m40s">Below the subatomic level of analysis, there’s
nothing deterministic at all.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h10m44s">And the stuff that things are made of is so
mysterious that we can’t even-- we can’t</a>

00:10:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h10m50s">So it turns out that rather than the story
world be, being dependent on the object world,</a>
00:10:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h10m57s">it might be the other way around.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h11m00s">And that implies at least to some degree that
the story world is actually more real, whatever</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h11m05s">that means.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h11m06s">And then, I told you that, well, the real

00:23:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h23m43s">But we don't actually know.</a>
00:23:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h23m45s">So then you think okay, well here's the here's
the rule, say, something like this.</a>
00:23:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h23m52s">If you look at the world from this perspective,
which is something you have to decide if you're</a>
00:23:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h23m55s">you know, you find compelling and reasonable,
the rule is this; you're always gonna run</a>
00:23:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h24m05s">into anomaly, right?</a>
00:24:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h24m07s">And anomaly’s always gonna look, look to
you like, like this.</a>
00:24:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h24m13s">And
it's no bloody wonder you wanna run away from</a>
00:24:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h24m15s">that.</a>
00:24:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h24m16s">I mean in some ways your whole body's telling
you watch out, and for good reason because</a>
00:24:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h24m20s">it's no joke.</a>
00:24:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h24m21s">But then there's more to the story because
the anomalous thing, that's everything you</a>
00:24:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h24m25s">don’t know.</a>
00:24:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h24m27s">you might say well, you're going out with
someone and you wanna have a long term relationship.</a>
00:24:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h24m30s">They betray you.</a>
00:24:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h24m31s">How could there be any good in that?</a>
00:24:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h24m34s">That's certainly what you're gonna ask when
you first encounter the unexpected information</a>
00:24:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h24m39s">But then you might think could be that I'm
a little too naive for my own good.</a>
00:24:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h24m44s">Right?</a>
00:24:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h24m45s">People pull me in a little more than they
should or I'm not sufficiently careful when</a>
00:24:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h24m49s">I enter into a relationship with people.</a>
00:24:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h24m51s">Or I don't treat people right.</a>
00:24:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h24m53s">Or I don't have a good conceptualization of
myself.</a>
00:24:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h24m56s">Or I'm chasing after the wrong person.</a>
00:24:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h24m59s">Well that's all gonna be very annoying to
learn.</a>
00:24:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h25m01s">But if you don't learn it you're gonna be
in big trouble.</a>
00:25:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h25m03s">So maybe the best thing to do when an anomaly
of that sort hits you is to think okay, yeah,</a>
00:25:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h25m08s">it's a dragon.</a>
00:25:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h25m09s">No doubt it will eat me.</a>
00:25:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h25m11s">But if I don't let it eat me then there'll
just be another one waiting around the corner</a>
00:25:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h25m14s">and it'll probably be a little bit bigger.</a>
00:25:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h25m16s">And if I get eaten by enough of them, I'm
not really gonna wanna be around much.</a>
00:25:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h25m19s">And maybe I'm not gonna be willing to help
other people be around much either.</a>
00:25:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h25m23s">Doesn’t seem like a very good alternative
to me.</a>
00:25:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h25m28s">So back in 1957, some new Gnostic writings
were discovered in a, in a cave.</a>
00:25:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h25m38s">They were discovered by these two Arab guys
who went out to kill the man who killed their</a>
00:25:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h25m43s">father.</a>
00:25:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h25m44s">They took him out into this cave and they
killed him.</a>
00:25:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h25m46s">And when they were burying him they found
these amphora full of papers and papyrus.</a>
00:25:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h25m50s">And they took them home.</a>
00:25:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h25m51s">And their mother used a bunch of them to light
cooking fires with.</a>
00:25:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h25m55s">And one day one of their friends who was an
antiquities dealer showed up.</a>
00:25:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h25m58s">And he said you know you shouldn't be burning
those.</a>
00:25:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h26m01s">Those are about fifteen hundred years old.</a>
00:26:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h26m03s">And they look like very early Gnostic gospels
And the Gnostics were this branch of Christianity</a>
00:26:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h26m08s">that was pretty violently suppressed by the
emergence of Orthodox Christianity.</a>
00:26:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h26m12s">And the Gnostics believed that faith was a
good thing but knowledge was all right too.</a>
00:26:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h26m18s">And they wrote gospel accounts say of Christ's
life that were knowledge predicated as much</a>
00:26:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h26m25s">as revelation predicated say.</a>
00:26:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h26m27s">And this is one of the quotes from one of
those gospels, the gospel of Thomas, which</a>
00:26:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h26m30s">is actually one that, the only one that got
out.</a>
00:26:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h26m34s">Carl Jung got a hold of them, interestingly
enough.</a>
00:26:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h26m36s">And this is one of the quotes.</a>
00:26:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h26m38s">And I really like this.</a>
00:26:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h26m40s">This is a non-canonical saying of Christ.</a>
00:26:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h26m43s">And the saying is: “if you bring forth what
is within you what you bring forth will save</a>
00:26:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h26m49s">you.</a>
00:26:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h26m51s">If you do not bring forth what is within you,
what you do not bring forth will destroy ”</a>
00:26:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h26m59s">And I think that's a pretty good line to close
off the class.</a>
00:26:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsiOwZabM#t=00h27m04s">So thank you for attending.</a>
