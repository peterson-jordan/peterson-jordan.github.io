00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h00m02s">like we started off talking about one thing and then the other person twisted</a>
00:00:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h00m06s">our words and before we knew it, we lost our cool, 
lost respect in their eyes, and maybe even acted like a jerk.</a>
00:00:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h00m12s">Now, I don't normally do the same person twice in a row but</a>
00:00:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h00m15s">this interview between Cathy Newman and Jordan Peterson</a>
00:00:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h00m18s">was just too interesting of an opportunity to discuss how you can handle someone</a>
00:00:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h00m22s">who uses subtle conversational tricks to bully you into looking dumb.</a>
00:00:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h00m26s">So in this video, you're gonna see firsthand some of the most common tricks</a>
00:00:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h00m30s">that people might be using on you and you're also gonna learn</a>
00:00:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h00m32s">how to reverse those so that you can walk out of a kind of aggressive situation</a>
00:00:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h00m37s">having earned more respect than you had going in.</a>
00:00:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h00m40s">So first off, to stop a conversational bully,</a>
00:00:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h00m43s">you have to realize what's going on before it's too late.</a>
00:00:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h00m46s">Now, typically, a person will reveal their aggressive attitude early on</a>
00:00:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h00m50s">with their tone of voice and their word choice — kind of like this —</a>
00:00:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h00m53s">...but I wasn't specifically aiming this message at young men to begin with;</a>
00:00:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h00m57s">it just kind of turned out that way but—</a>
00:00:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h00m59s">And it's mostly, you admit, it's mostly men listening.</a>
00:00:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h01m01s">In this case, Cathy is indicating very clearly that 
she thinks Jordan has done something wrong.</a>
00:01:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h01m06s">Otherwise, why would she use the word "admit?"</a>
00:01:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h01m09s">She makes her stance clear a moment later when she implies 
that he should be bothered for being divisive. Just watch.</a>
00:01:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h01m14s">Does it bother you that your audience is predominantly male? Is that a bit divisive?</a>
00:01:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h01m21s">The point here is that even when they're being passive-aggressive,</a>
00:01:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h01m24s">people will often indicate that they're about to attack you before they actually do.</a>
00:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h01m29s">So if you hear someone say something like,</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h01m31s">"Well, what do you have to say for yourself?" be prepared.</a>
00:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h01m34s">That person thinks that you've done something wrong and you need to be</a>
00:01:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h01m37s">very careful what you say next not because you did do something wrong</a>
00:01:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h01m41s">but because a conversational bully may be trying to trap you into saying</a>
00:01:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h01m45s">something that you disagree with so that they can attack that straw man.</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h01m49s">And the first way that this often happens is called 
the "so-you're-saying trap." Here's what it looks like.</a>
00:01:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h01m55s">So you're saying women have some sort of 
duty to sort of help fix the crisis of masculinity?</a>
00:01:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h02m00s">Women want to dominate — is that what you're saying?</a>
00:02:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h02m02s">So you're saying that anyone who believes in equality whether 
you call them feminists or whatever you want to call them</a>
00:02:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h02m07s">should basically give up because "it ain't gonna happen."</a>
00:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h02m10s">Let me just get this straight; you're saying that we should 
organize our societies along the lines of the lobsters.</a>
00:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h02m16s">The general pattern here is that someone says, "So you're saying..."</a>
00:02:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h02m19s">and then proceeds to oversimplify or mischaracterize what you actually said.</a>
00:02:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h02m23s">I won't spend too long here because it's very easy to spot</a>
00:02:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h02m26s">and it's rather simple to avoid and get around by saying,</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h02m28s">"Well, actually, what I was saying is..." and then repeat yourself.</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h02m31s">...along the lines of the lobsters.</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h02m32s">I'm saying that it's inevitable that there will be continuity</a>
00:02:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h02m35s">in the way that animals and human beings organize their structures.</a>
00:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h02m39s">But there's a much sneakier way that people may 
mischaracterize your beliefs and then attack them.</a>
00:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h02m44s">Basically, it's when someone's words imply that you 
believe something you don't and they don't actually say it.</a>
00:02:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h02m50s">So in business, they call this "assuming the sale" like when a car salesman says,</a>
00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h02m54s">"So would you like that with the leather interior or with the 
fabric interior?" before you even decided to buy the car.</a>
00:02:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h03m01s">Now, with the several thousand dollar purchase, you're likely to notice this and say,</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h03m04s">"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who said I was buying in the first place?"</a>
00:03:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h03m06s">But it's very likely that this is happening to you in conversation 
all the time and you don't even notice. Here's how it might look.</a>
00:03:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h03m14s">[Cathy talks over Jordan] Yeah, but why? 
Why should woman put up with those reasons?</a>
00:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h03m16s">Embedding the question "why should women put up with it?" 
are several important presuppositions; namely —</a>
00:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h03m21s">one, that there is something to put up with and two, 
that Jordan thinks woman should put up with it.</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h03m27s">Now, the trap here for Jordan would be to answer Cathy's question directly</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h03m30s">and many of us fall into it in similar situations</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h03m33s">then we start arguing for things that we don't even really believe just out of habit.</a>
00:03:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h03m37s">Instead, you need to identify that hidden presupposition and then call it out.</a>
00:03:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h03m43s">So watch how carefully Jordan listens to Cathy's questions</a>
00:03:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h03m46s">so that he can catch what she's not saying.</a>
00:03:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h03m48s">"Why should women put up with it?" I'm not saying they 
should put up with it. I'm saying that the claim—</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h03m53s">Here's another example of assuming-the-sale from later in that conversation.</a>
00:03:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h03m57s">See if you can spot the hidden presupposition and 
ask yourself what you might say to respond to it.</a>
00:03:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h04m02s">...which women do a lot of.</a>
00:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h04m03s">But why shouldn't women have the right to choose not to have children?</a>
00:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h04m07s">So what's the hidden presupposition —</a>
00:04:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h04m09s">that Jordan thinks women must have children. And of course, 
he defends a woman's right to make any decision about that.</a>
00:04:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h04m14s">...the right to choose and demand it, correct?</a>
00:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h04m17s">They do. They can. Yeah, that's fine.</a>
00:04:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h04m19s">But you're saying that makes them unhappy.</a>
00:04:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h04m21s">Here's one more example. See if you can spot the hidden presupposition here.</a>
00:04:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h04m24s">[Cathy talks over Jordan] So you want to say to your 
followers now, "Quit the abuse. Quit the anger."</a>
00:04:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h04m28s">Did you catch it? The presupposition is that Jordan's followers are abusing people.</a>
00:04:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h04m33s">Now, he can't answer that question directly; he has 
to address that hidden point first and he does.</a>
00:04:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h04m38s">Well, we'd need some substantial examples of the abuse 
and the anger before I could detail that question.</a>
00:04:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h04m44s">There's a lot of it out there.</a>
00:04:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h04m45s">When I cut the clips like this, it makes it very easy to see these 
hidden presuppositions but in real time, this can be difficult.</a>
00:04:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h04m51s">One simple thing that you can do to make it easier on yourself is to purposely</a>
00:04:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h04m55s">assume a relaxed posture as Jordan does throughout this entire conversation.</a>
00:04:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h05m00s">Now, this posture actually helps you to think less frantically because your body</a>
00:05:00</p>

example of the third conversational bully tactic</a>
00:05:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h05m35s">in this video which I'm naming the "smash technique." Take a look.</a>
00:05:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h05m39s">[Cathy talks over Jordan] So you want to say to your 
followers now, "Quit the abuse. Quit the anger."</a>
00:05:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h05m43s">It's subtle here but Cathy smashes together 
two very different terms — abuse and anger.</a>
00:05:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h05m49s">Now, by ending on anger, it would be easier for 
Jordan to just forget it and answer the question.</a>
00:05:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h05m53s">But that would tacitly accept that his followers were abusing people.</a>
00:05:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h05m57s">That's why the smash technique is so frustrating; people are 
embedding hidden statements that you actually disagree with and</a>
00:05:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h06m03s">then moving through them before you have the time to voice that disagreement.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h06m50s">This moves us to the second section of this video which is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h06m52s">how to persuade someone in these kinds of situations.</a>
00:06:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h06m55s">And I will say, it seems to me that it doesn't look like Jordan is necessarily</a>

00:06:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h07m04s">There are still some valuable tips to be gleamed 
from this video and a few things that I'd add</a>
00:07:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h07m08s">First, do not straw man the other person's ideas even if they're doing it to you.</a>
00:07:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h07m13s">And to be clear, I don't know if I mentioned this,</a>
00:07:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h07m15s">straw manning is when you create a caricature of their ideas 
and then attack those rather than what they truly believe.</a>
00:07:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h07m22s">Instead, show the other person that you are truly engaging in their real points,</a>
00:07:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h07m27s">attempt to understand them, and sometimes this mean that 
you have to ask them to repeat themselves so that you can.</a>
00:07:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h07m32s">Seven? Seven women... repeat that one—</a>
00:07:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h07m35s">Seven women running the top FTSE 100 companies in the UK.</a>
00:07:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h07m38s">Well, the first question might be.</a>
00:07:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h07m40s">After you've made an honest attempt to understand them, you need to make sure</a>
00:07:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h07m43s">that they can understand you which is necessary for persuasion.</a>
00:07:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h07m47s">And to do that, you often have to use the visual imagery.</a>
00:07:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h07m50s">For instance, here's a very abstract point without any images that Jordan makes.</a>
00:07:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h07m55s">...that it's inevitable that there will be continuity in the way 
that animals and human beings organize their structures.</a>
00:07:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h08m01s">It's absolutely inevitable. And there is one-third of 
a billion years of evolutionary history behind that.</a>
00:08:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h08m08s">Now, maybe you can understand that but it kind of lacks any emotional oomph.</a>
00:08:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h08m12s">But notice how the addition of a concrete example 
makes that one-third of a billion years just feel different.</a>
00:08:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h08m18s">That's so long that a third of a billion years ago, 
there weren't even trees; it's a long time.</a>
00:08:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h08m25s">So adding concrete examples especially ones that people can easily imagine</a>
00:08:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h08m29s">is a smart persuasive move and lastly, when you're arguing, oftentimes</a>
00:08:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h08m34s">the best way to get someone to change their position is not by changing their mind</a>
00:08:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h08m38s">but by gently showing them that they are already agreeing with you.</a>
00:08:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h08m42s">I talked about this in the frame video but here's an example from this interview.</a>
00:08:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h08m45s">Why should your rights to freedom of speech 
trump a trans-person's right not to be offended?</a>
00:08:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h08m51s">Because in order to be able to think, you have to risk being offensive.</a>
00:08:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h08m56s">I mean, look at the conversation we're having right now.</a>
00:08:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h08m58s">You know, like, you're certainly willing to risk offending me in the pursuit of truth.</a>
00:08:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h09m02s">Why should you have the right to do that? It's been rather uncomfortable.</a>
00:09:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h09m06s">This is huge. Jordan is no longer arguing that her point is wrong;</a>
00:09:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h09m10s">he's arguing that she already agrees with him — 
her behavior and her previous statements demonstrate</a>
00:09:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h09m15s">that she cares more about free speech than not offending people.</a>
00:09:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h09m19s">And then Jordan doesn't try to make this point wrong; 
he shows her how they're actually very much in alignment.</a>
00:09:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h09m24s">You're doing what you should do which is 
digging a bit to see what the hell's going on.</a>
00:09:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h09m28s">And I gave you what you should do but you're exercising 
your freedom of speech to certainly risk offending me.</a>
00:09:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h09m33s">And that's fine. I think — more power to you as far as I'm concerned.</a>
00:09:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h09m37s">And then of course Cathy feels stumped because she 
does actually agree with Jordan and she's proven it herself.</a>
00:09:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h09m43s">People have a strong desire to remain consistent</a>
00:09:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h09m46s">with things they've already said and done so oftentimes, this becomes</a>
00:09:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h09m49s">one of the few ways to persuade someone who's really dug in their heels.</a>
00:09:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h09m53s">You're basically showing them that they don't have to move</a>
00:09:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h09m56s">in order to agree with you; they already do right where they're dug in.</a>
00:09:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h10m00s">And then of course, Jordan hits her with the "gotcha."</a>
00:10:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h10m02s">...uh, and... [sighs] I'm just trying to work that out but I mean... [sighs]</a>
00:10:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h10m09s">Jordan: Hah. Gotcha.
Cathy: You have got me. You have got me.</a>
00:10:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h10m12s">Even though I laughed at that phrase at the time I was watching the interview,</a>
00:10:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h10m15s">I have to say that last bit "gotcha" does not improve Jordan's persuasive case.</a>
00:10:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h10m21s">It actually makes Cathy feel silly and wrong as opposed to</a>
00:10:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h10m24s">happy to discover that she and Jordan are really on the same team all along</a>
00:10:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h10m28s">and if I had to give one last point of constructive criticism,</a>
00:10:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h10m31s">it would be that Jordan answered all of Cathy's questions</a>
00:10:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h10m34s">rather than trying to proactively address her deeper unstated emotional concern.</a>
00:10:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h10m39s">And in my opinion, that emotional concern is that Jordan is her enemy —</a>
00:10:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h10m43s">that if he believes something, it must be against her interests.</a>
00:10:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h10m47s">If Jordan could have found that and pointed to a more common ground</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9W-wlJHPA#t=00h10m54s">would have continued in such an argumentative fashion but</a>
