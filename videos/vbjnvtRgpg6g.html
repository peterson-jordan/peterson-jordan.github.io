<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h04m01s">you guys are around 21 or something like that.
I was probably about your age and a couple</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h04m06s">years older. First year I was in graduate

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h04m22s">War really came to a peak. And one time, I

Whenever Stalin announced that he had developed</a>

is that they use atom bombs as a trigger.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h04m46s">So they're quite the weapon, and the USSR
and the US made some very, very big ones.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h04m55s">They're big enough to make the thing that

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h05m15s">about ten years ago, I went down to Tucson,
Arizona to a conference on consciousness there.</a>
00:05:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h05m22s">And they have that conference fairly frequently
in Tucson. It's become quite a popular conference</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h05m28s">even though it isn't clear to me that we know
anything more about consciousness than we</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h05m31s">did before the conference started. And, Tucson's
kind of an interesting town. It's in the middle</a>
00:05:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h05m37s">of the desert, the cool desert, with the big
sort of Saguaro road runner cactuses. But</a>
00:05:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h05m46s">it's also extremely dry there which is, of
course, what you'd expect given that it's</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h05m49s">a desert. So one of the things that Americans

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h05m54s">there. And so there is an airplane museum,
which is an amazing place. It has maybe 500</a>
00:05:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h05m59s">planes including John F Kennedy's Air Force
One, which is the jet that he used to zoom</a>
00:05:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h06m04s">around the world - it didn't have a shower
by the way.</a>
00:06:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h06m07s">It's funny because on the outside it looked
like a modern jet, but on the inside, it looked</a>
00:06:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h06m11s">pretty much like it was from World War Two
because 1962 is a lot closer to World War</a>
00:06:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h06m17s">Two than it is it now, in all sorts of ways.
Even the rockets that went to the moon looked</a>
00:06:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h06m22s">like they were built by people who were using
World War Two technology - they were full</a>
00:06:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h06m26s">switches, mechanical switches, and it's pretty
basic. Anyways, as well as the airport museum,</a>
00:06:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h06m35s">which is a very interesting place - there's
B-52 bombers there and all sorts of things.</a>
00:06:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h06m39s">Those things are huge. There's also an airport
graveyard where they store old fighter jets</a>
00:06:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h06m43s">and there's a lot of old fighter jets so there's
acres, and acres, and acres, and thousands</a>
00:06:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h06m48s">and thousands of old mothballed fighter jets
lined up in the desert. So that's kind of</a>
00:06:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h06m53s">cool in a strange way, but there was one other
thing down there that I went and saw which</a>
00:06:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h06m59s">was a decommissioned nuclear missile site
and it was an intercontinental ballistic missile</a>
00:06:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h07m05s">site and those were built in the fifties and
early sixties, and they were major league</a>
00:07:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h07m11s">rockets, those things. I think the silo, cause
we could go into the silo, and it was certainly</a>
00:07:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h07m19s">farther across in diameter than this room.</a>
00:07:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h07m22s">I would think probably twice as large as this
room, so you can imagine how big a missile</a>
00:07:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h07m27s">that would be - it's not your grandmother's
missile. It's a major league piece of armament,</a>
00:07:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h07m32s">and out on the grounds - these things were
underground, deep underground, because they</a>
00:07:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h07m36s">didn't want them to get blown up if they were
bombed, so they buried them quite a long ways</a>
00:07:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h07m42s">down and to get into it, you had to go through
this massive steel door that was like a huge</a>
00:07:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h07m46s">safe door except, you know ten times as big,
and ten times as thick. Out in the yard of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h07m53s">the nuclear missile site, there were fences
with barbed wire on them of course, and there</a>
00:07:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h07m59s">was a missile cap. It'd be the nose cone of
the missile. Some of these missiles had single</a>
00:07:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h08m04s">warheads, which were more than sufficient
to demolish a city and some of them had multiple</a>
00:08:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h08m10s">warheads, so they would shoot out into space
and then come back into Earth and then they</a>
00:08:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h08m15s">essentialy break apart or disperse into multiple
missiles and then you can really bomb the</a>
00:08:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h08m19s">hell out of whatever you were going to bomb
instead of just destroying one city.</a>
00:08:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h08m23s">And so, the nose cone was sitting out there
and that was a pretty freaky looking thing,</a>
00:08:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h08m27s">I'll tell you. Like it was big. It was about
seven feet high I would think, and maybe about</a>
00:08:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h08m33s">the same amount across. It was made of this
plastic, kind of variegated plastic material</a>
00:08:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h08m38s">that was about three-quarters of an inch thick
and then it would melt off, of course, on</a>
00:08:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h08m42s">re-entry because as I said these things shot
out into space, and so that was kind of unnerving</a>
00:08:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h08m48s">really, in a serious way. So we're at the
missile site and you know, I mentioned your</a>
00:08:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h08m54s">grandmother's missile. There was actually
a reason for that. It was a bit of foreshadowing</a>
00:08:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h08m58s">because it was a very funny place because
at the front of the missile site there was</a>
00:08:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h09m03s">sort of this museum set up, you know, and
it had pictures of Reagan and Gorbachev on</a>
00:09:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h09m08s">it because they decommissioned the missile
sites when detente occurred and then when</a>
00:09:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h09m14s">Perestroika hit, and the Soviet Union started
to collapse, and so there were all these pictures</a>
00:09:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h09m18s">of Reagan and Gorbachev from 1984 and so the
museum was kind of like a time capsule of</a>
00:09:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h09m23s">1984, and the people who were running it were,
like, retired Arizonans. And they were like</a>
00:09:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h09m30s">your grandparents, assuming you have retired
Arizonans for your grandparents.</a>
00:09:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h09m34s">But they're real friendly and they're pretty
happy to show you their nuclear missile museum</a>
00:09:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h09m39s">and it was sort of like being in their rec
room, except that it was a nuclear missile</a>
00:09:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h09m42s">site and they were hospitable and it was weird,
you know. It's like welcome to - you don't</a>
00:09:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h09m49s">welcome people to a nuclear missile site.
It's just not reasonable and so it was very</a>
00:09:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h09m54s">disconcerting and it was disconcerting that
it was locked in the 1980's and then it was</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h09m59s">disconcerting that it was friendly and hospitable
and, you know they were kind of proud to show</a>
00:09:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h10m03s">it off and happy to be there, and then when
you went down into the nuclear missile silo</a>
00:10:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h10m09s">proper - the control center, it's sort of
like Star Trek, you know, from 1966 or 1967</a>
00:10:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h10m15s">except more primitive. I don't remember if
the Star Trek control command area was modeled</a>
00:10:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h10m24s">after the nuclear missile site control systems
or if it was the other way around but I suspect</a>
00:10:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h10m29s">it was that they were modeled after the nuclear
controls but that was really 1950's - like</a>
00:10:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h10m35s">the whole place was painted in that pastel
green that, you know, late fifties and early</a>
00:10:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h10m40s">sixties people really liked.</a>
00:10:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h10m41s">And it had this 1950's - what would you call
it - aesthetic. And you wouldn't necessarily</a>
00:10:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h10m47s">think that a nuclear missile site would have
an aesthetic but it does, and it looked like</a>
00:10:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h10m51s">high tech 1957 technology. So they brought
you into the control room and the control</a>
00:10:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h10m59s">desk was probably - or the module or whatever you might
call it - was about three times as long as</a>
00:10:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h11m03s">this - maybe four times. It was a pretty impressive
piece of machinery and the way you launch</a>
00:11:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h11m09s">the missiles was not too secure in my humble
opinion. What happened was, one guy wore the</a>
00:11:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h11m15s">key around his neck. And then another guy wore the key around his neck.</a>
00:11:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h11m18s">In order to launch the sites, you had to put
the keys in the same time, and they were far</a>
00:11:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h11m23s">enough apart so nobody could stretch their
arms, you know, which was kind of the high-tech</a>
00:11:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h11m27s">part of it. So, and, he had to put a key in,
and you both had to turn the key for 10 seconds.</a>
00:11:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h11m33s">Okay, so, and one thing you may know about
ballistic missiles or you may not, is they're</a>
00:11:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h11m38s">not cruise missiles. Once you set those things
off, they're not coming back. They're bullets.</a>
00:11:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h11m43s">That's what makes them ballistic. You know,
if you aim a gun at someone and you shoot,</a>
00:11:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h11m46s">and you decide halfway, when the bullet's halfway
there, maybe that wasn't a good thing to do,</a>
00:11:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h11m52s">it's a little late because you're not telling
that bullet to come back.</a>
00:11:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h11m56s">And it's the same with ballistic missiles,
and those things are going a lot faster than</a>
00:11:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h12m00s">bullets, you know, like a 22 bullet goes about
the speed of sound, but a ballistic missile,</a>
00:12:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h12m07s">that thing has to go around 7 miles a second
to get out of the gravity o f the earth. Now</a>
00:12:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h12m11s">i'm not sure they go quite that fast because
that's escape velocity right, You need to do</a>
00:12:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h12m16s">that to get out of the gravitational well.
But to get out there into space, you have</a>
00:12:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h12m19s">to be damn close to 7 miles a second. So it's
a bullet, a very large bullet with a very</a>
00:12:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h12m25s">explosive head on it going 7 miles a second.
And once you turn those two keys man, that's</a>
00:12:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h12m31s">it. There's no turning back. That's that.
And so they took us through a simulated launch</a>
00:12:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h12m36s">which still kind of, it's still an uncanny
feeling remembering that, you know, because</a>
00:12:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h12m43s">it's a hell of a thing to apprehend. And then
they told us that the keys were in once. Right.</a>
00:12:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h12m50s">So we were ten seconds away. Now they wouldn't
tell us when, but we know when. It was during</a>
00:12:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h12m55s">the cuban missile crisis.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h12m57s">So, you know, there are a couple of times
in the latter part of the 20th century, where</a>
00:12:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h13m03s">we made it through the eye of a needle, we
barely bloody well made it. And, the cuban</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h13m10s">missile crisis was one of those points. But
in the early 80's, things were heating up</a>
00:13:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h13m14s">pretty badly too. In about 1984, there was
a movie that came out, called The Day After.</a>

And basically what it showed was, what a city</a>
00:13:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h13m30s">would be like, the day after the United States

a pretty hair raising movie. And one of the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h26m26s">he was raped, and brutalized, and tormented

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h38m28s">one of the unspoken fundamental assumptions
of Western intellectuals in particular. Jane</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h38m35s">Goodall thought, in many ways, the same way.
She thought chimps were basically animals,</a>
00:38:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h38m39s">they're okay. They co-exist relatively peacefully
with one another. Even Carl Rogers - who I</a>
00:38:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h38m52s">talk about a bit in my Personality class - he
thought that people were basically fundamentally</a>

But the problem is, you look at chimps and</a>
00:38:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h39m01s">they're a fair bit like us.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h39m03s">Bonobos - you can look at them too, they're
genetically quite related to us, so we're</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h39m09s">a weird mixture of the two. But chimps, like
those things, there is no evidence that they</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h39m16s">really have any internal control over their
aggression at all. There was a horrible case</a>
00:39:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h39m21s">about two years ago, where a woman was interacting
with a chimp and it tore her to pieces, and</a>
00:39:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h39m26s">they can do that. It took her face right off,
and they have about the strength of six men.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h39m32s">An adult male chimp can break a three hundred

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h39m42s">So in Arnhem zoo for example, there has been
a troop of chimps there that have been followed</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h39m50s">by an extremely brilliant primatologist named
Frans de Waal, whose work I would very highly</a>
00:39:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h39m55s">recommend. De Waal is a very smart guy, and
he's looked at the origins of morality in</a>

It's very, very nice work - very, very clear-headed.</a>
00:39:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h40m04s">But you know, he's recounted absolutely horrific
stories about chimpanzee behavior. One of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h40m10s">the stories he talked about, for example,
was you kind of have this idea that there's</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h40m15s">a male chimp hierarchy. It's roughly true
- there's a female hierarchy too, but the</a>
00:40:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h40m19s">males in the chimp world anyways, tend to
be the dominant ones.</a>
00:40:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h40m22s">You know, you kind of think of a dominant

not to exactly be true. In this particular</a>
00:40:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h40m34s">case, the guy who was running the chimp troop
was a bit of a bully, and he wasn't making</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h40m43s">weaker guys can probably take you out, and
that's what happened during Frans de Waal's</a>

00:40:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h40m47s">Two chimps attacked the leader. They had a
coalition, they were grooming each other,</a>
00:40:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h40m52s">they were pals. And chimps are pretty good
at remembering reciprocal relationships, and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h40m57s">having friendships. They have a very highly
social structure. They just tore him apart.</a>
00:40:57</p>

even want to know about. So chimps really</a>
00:41:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h41m05s">have no upper limit on their capacity for
aggression. And when they hunt, because chimps</a>
00:41:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h41m10s">hunt, they like meat - they often hunt Colobus
monkeys, and they weight about 35 pounds.</a>
00:41:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h41m15s">A Colobus monkey is a major league animal,
and they eat those things alive. And they</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h41m18s">scream while they're being killed, and that
does not slow the chimps down one bit. So</a>
00:41:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h41m22s">it's not obvious the chimp is really a creature
of a lot of empathy - especially the males.</a>
00:41:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h41m28s">The females are likely more empathetic because
they have to deal with infants for long periods</a>
00:41:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h41m31s">of time. What seems to inhibit the aggression
of male chimps isn't anything they hold internally.</a>
00:41:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h41m38s">It seems that when they get hyper aggressive
in the troop, the troop gets more and more</a>
00:41:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h41m42s">agitated and basically shuts them down. So
you can imagine maybe you're in a rough bar,</a>
00:41:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h41m46s">and some dingbat who's half-psychopathic and
has had two pints of alcohol, is starting</a>
00:41:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h41m51s">to cause a tremendous amount of trouble. He's
not going to shut himself down, but the rest</a>
00:41:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h41m55s">of the troop might. And that kind of means
the control over the aggression is externalized.</a>
00:41:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h42m00s">It's not a consequence of superego control.
We like to think that we control our own aggression,</a>
00:42:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h42m07s">but I'm not so sure about that.
If you read things like - there's a great</a>
00:42:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h42m11s">book, a horrifying book published about twenty
years ago called the Rape of Nanking,</a>
00:42:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h42m16s">which is - the woman who wrote it committed
suicide and that suffices to tell you what</a>
00:42:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h42m21s">the Rape of Nanking was all about. It's a
story about the Japanese in WW2 going into</a>
00:42:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h42m26s">a Chinese city called Nanking where, I believe,
about 350,000 people were killed.</a>
00:42:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h42m31s">The Nazis in that story were the good guys,
so you can imagine the kind of brutality that</a>
00:42:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h42m36s">was going on there. But, there's absolutely,
perfectly well documented evidence that the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h42m42s">Japanese soldiers engaged in competitive brutality.
So really what happened was the Japanese had</a>
00:42:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h42m49s">been pretty militarized by World War II, and
they adopted a Prussian education system.</a>
00:42:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h42m54s">The Prussians and Germans, pre 20th century
Germans, were basically interested in educating</a>
00:42:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h43m01s">obedient soldiers because it was a militaristic
culture. The Japanese kind of adopted that</a>
00:43:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h43m07s">because they were pretty sick of being kicked
around by the Europeans - pretty successfully</a>
00:43:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h43m10s">because they defeated the Russians in the
early stages of the 20th century.</a>
00:43:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h43m15s">It was quite a shock to everyone in Europe,
and a cause for great celebration in Japan.</a>
00:43:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h43m19s">Anyways, they militarized the hell out of
their young men, and taught them basically</a>
00:43:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h43m24s">that the Japanese were a master race, and
that other people were subhuman. It's a very</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h43m28s">common human way of thinking, by the way.
I would say it's really the default way human</a>
00:43:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h43m34s">tribes think about other tribes. I mean, it's
a little more complicated than that because</a>
00:43:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h43m39s">human tribes tend to trade with other tribes.</a>
00:43:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h43m43s">So it's not all demonization, but a lot of
it is. If you look around the world in the</a>
00:43:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h43m47s">anthropological literature, what you see is
that the names that most tribes have for themselves</a>
00:43:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h43m53s">is something like The Human Beings, or The
People, indicating that the rest of the people</a>
00:43:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h43m58s">aren't really people. They're barbarians,
or you know. They live out where the sun is</a>
00:43:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h44m03s">being eaten by the dragon of the night. The
word barbarian is a word that comes from the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h44m09s">Greeks making fun of how non-Greeks spoke.
They thought they went bar bar bar bar</a>
00:44:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h44m14s">bar, something like that. So anyways, what
Goodall found was that the chimps - the chimp</a>
00:44:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h44m20s">adolescents in particular, particularly the
males - would patrol the borders of their</a>
00:44:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h44m26s">territory in groups of three or four, often
with a female or two. But the females didn't</a>
00:44:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h44m31s">seem to be really the - they were more part
of the group rather than the initiators. But</a>
00:44:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h44m38s">what the chimps would do is if they found
a chimp from another troop, even if that was</a>
00:44:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h44m42s">a chimp that had moved from their troop in
the not too distant past and joined another,</a>
00:44:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h44m47s">cause sometimes the males leave and they go
to other troops. If they outnumbered them,</a>
00:44:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h44m51s">they would tear them to pieces.</a>
00:44:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h44m53s">It looked like that was why they were doing
the border patrol. They're out looking for</a>
00:44:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h44m58s">trouble. They're gangs, roughly speaking,
and they were looking for trouble. But the</a>
00:44:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h45m01s">point of it is that - and they would only
attack if they outnumbered because chimps</a>
00:45:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h45m06s">can, I wouldn't say they can count, but they
have a rudimentary notion of group size.</a>
00:45:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h45m13s">i don't think you can count without being able
to verbalize, but you can estimate at a glance.</a>
00:45:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h45m18s">So when I say tear apart, that's exactly what
I mean. There's no upper limit on the brutality.</a>
00:45:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h45m25s">So Goodall discovered that first, and she
didn't tell anybody about it. Now she had</a>
00:45:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h45m30s">a reason. Some of them might think we're ideological

I don't think it is. Economic is just a secondary</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h51m34s">so that some of them can rise to the top and

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h51m56s">this, I first started studying political science

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h58m03s">that people aren't really moral, they're just

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=00h58m08s">Most of what you'd call your morality isn't
morality at all. It's just you're too afraid</a>

That's a whole different thing. So anyways,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h05m04s">okay well here's the situation. It's pretty

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h05m09s">because first of all a belief structure orients

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h05m22s">was better than the side he was on, obviously.</a>

out, I thought well that's it man. We're basically</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h08m07s">that was wrong, thank god, but it took me

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h08m16s">So another thing we're gonna try to figure
out is not only exactly why people have belief</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h08m22s">systems, exactly what a belief system is,
and why they compete, and why you can't just</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h08m27s">get rid of them. But, we're also gonna figure
out what it is that you might be able to do</a>
01:08:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h08m31s">about the fact that you're going to inhabit

sense, it's really a problem of social being,</a>
01:08:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h08m42s">right? And creatures have been trying to solve
this problem ever since, well we don't know</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h08m46s">how long. I like to use lobsters as an example
because lobsters arrange themselves into dominance</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h08m56s">So you can have pretty damn complex social

01:20:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h21m03s">- is that do not do anything for anyone they
cannot do for themselves. You're stealing</a>

You're not doing a favor by helping them do</a>
01:21:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h21m21s">anything they can do themselves. It's kind

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h21m27s">So anyways, one of the things we're going
to look at as well, is the dark side of positive</a>
01:21:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h21m33s">motivations. Now how are we gonna do this?
One of the things you might ask yourself is</a>
01:21:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h21m42s">how in the world do you know if something
is true? Now, the first thing I would suggest</a>
01:21:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h21m47s">is that the attitude you guys should bring
to this class is that nothing that I tell</a>
01:21:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h21m52s">you is true. Okay, now I don't mean you should
be arrogantly skeptical because that's not</a>
01:21:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h22m00s">appropriate. But, you should bring every critical
faculty you have to bear on what I tell you</a>
01:22:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h22m08s">to see if you can chip away at it because
what you want to do is you want to build yourself</a>
01:22:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h22m13s">a body of knowledge that you cannot undermine.
And the way you do that is by trying to undermine</a>
01:22:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h22m19s">it, by hacking away at the foundation with
everything you've got, and if the ideas can</a>

something. You've got a foundation. You've</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h22m29s">got something you can stand on that's gonna

01:22:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h22m34s">So I'm gonna tell you what I found that's
been useful to me when things got rough, but</a>
01:22:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h22m38s">I don't expect you to assume that that's gonna
work for you, and I don't want you to - like</a>
01:22:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h22m44s">I want you to listen and to think, but I want
you to keep your wits about you. Now, I'm</a>
01:22:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h22m49s">gonna tell you how I go about to determine
whether something is true. Now first of all,</a>
01:22:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h22m55s">there's different definitions of truth. So
we're gonna flip back and forth between two.</a>
01:22:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h23m04s">One definition of truth is an objective definition,
but we don't have to talk much about that</a>
01:23:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h23m09s">cause you guys already know what that is;
but there's another definition of truth that</a>
01:23:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h23m13s">I think the best way of defining it is as
pragmatically true. Pragmatism is a branch</a>
01:23:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h23m19s">of American philosophy, and it's a very sophisticated
branch of philosophy. In fact, I actually</a>
01:23:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h23m23s">think it's the most sophisticated brand of
philosophy.</a>
01:23:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h23m27s">Probably because it makes the least claims.
What the pragmatists state, basically, is</a>
01:23:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h23m33s">well you really don't know anything. You don't
have ultimate knowledge about anything, so</a>
01:23:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h23m37s">your knowledge always bottoms out in ignorance.
So then the question is well, how do you know</a>
01:23:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h23m42s">then, if anything is true? And the pragmatists
would say, in a sense you don't. What you</a>
01:23:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h23m47s">know always is if something is true enough
for a particular function. So for example,</a>
01:23:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h23m53s">your theory about getting to the door might
be that you can stand up and walk there, and</a>
01:23:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h23m58s">you might - well god only knows what might
happen on the way there you know. Maybe there'll</a>
01:23:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h24m02s">be an earthquake, or a ceiling tile might
fall on you. Who knows? Maybe you'll have</a>
01:24:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h24m05s">a heart attack. So you don't know whether
you can get there; you can infer from past</a>
01:24:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h24m10s">experience, but if you get there then what
you can say is my statement about truth was</a>
01:24:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h24m16s">sufficient so that the outcome was what the
theory predicted. So in some sense, what the</a>
01:24:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h24m22s">pragmatists are saying is that every time
you make a statement, especially if it's related</a>
01:24:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h24m26s">to action, that you offer a theory of truth
along with that statement, implicitly which</a>
01:24:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h24m32s">is that this is true enough if what I predict
happens happens.</a>
01:24:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h24m38s">And so, it's a very nice theory eh? It doesn't
require you to be omniscient about anything</a>
01:24:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h24m44s">for things to be true enough, and you are
ignorant - you don't know everything about</a>
01:24:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h24m48s">anything, and so obviously you're working
in the world with partial knowledge, and it</a>
01:24:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h24m53s">works - not all the time. You get old, you
get sick, you die. You're not gonna work it</a>
01:24:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h25m01s">out thoroughly. So we're gonna use the pragmatic
truth framework and we're gonna use the objective</a>
01:25:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h25m08s">truth framework. And one of the propositions
that I'm going to make to you is that the</a>
01:25:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h25m14s">stories that are associated with our deepest
moral intuitions are pragmatic truths, and</a>
01:25:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h25m24s">that you need pragmatic truths and you need
objective truths, and you need pragmatic truths</a>
01:25:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h25m28s">because you don't just need to know what the
world's made of. You need to know what to</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h25m35s">do about the fact that the world's made out
of things. And because human beings are motoric</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h25m46s">is it that you should act on the world. That
is not a question that could be addressed</a>
01:25:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h25m50s">by objective methods. Technically right? Because
it's actually a value question. What should</a>
01:25:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h25m55s">you do? Science, by its very methodologies,
refuses to answer such questions.</a>
01:25:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h26m02s">People confuse the fact that science is value
free, sort of, with the idea that existence</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h26m08s">is value free. Like that's philosophically
primitive, I would say, because science was</a>

this objective value in its technique. So</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h26m20s">you can't say we set this thing up to get

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h27m52s">how do you know if when you say that something

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h28m02s">Well, the answer seems self evident. It's
tricky because generally no one comes up to</a>
01:28:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h28m13s">you and says anger. They tell you a little
story where they use words related to anger</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h28m16s">in the story and you sort of derive what they
mean by angry from the context.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h28m21s">The context is important in defining the reality,
so you don't know if the central idea, anger,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h28m30s">can be pulled out of the context and you can
say that's a thing like iron is a thing, or</a>
01:28:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h28m35s">like mercury is a thing. Maybe it's not. Maybe
it's a pattern or maybe it's something that</a>

claims was that in order to determine whether</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h28m53s">or not something existed, you had to be able

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h28m59s">it's tricky because it's not obvious what
constitutes a different method. So you kind</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h30m21s">- you need a five-dimensional analysis, and
that's evolved. You might say, well let's</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h30m26s">call that a good estimate. You need five ways

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h30m31s">it's true. Now you know, when you're learning
about experimental psychology, p is less than</a>

determine whether the probability that that</a>

01:30:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h30m51s">But that's actually not right. It's not right

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h30m57s">psychologists have known it since the late

what I'm going to do is tell you a story,</a>
01:31:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h31m28s">roughly speaking, and I wanna make the story
evident at five or six different levels of</a>
01:31:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h31m34s">analysis. And I want to show you how the story
is the same at all these levels of analysis.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h31m40s">Now, the one - one of the potential flaws
of that method is this. Joseph Campbell, for</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h31m50s">example, wrote about hero mythology. Some
of you have probably read The Hero of a Thousand</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h31m55s">Faces. One of the criticisms about Joseph
Campbell and people like him, is that they</a>
01:31:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h32m00s">read the stories of multiple cultures, but
they have an a priori framework. Because of</a>
01:32:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h32m06s">the a priori framework, they only see what
their theory tells them that they're going</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h32m12s">They don't look for the exceptions, so it's
a problem with pattern recognition. You may</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h32m17s">be able to recognize patterns where they don't
exist. Now, my method could be criticized</a>
01:32:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h32m24s">on that grounds. But, the way I've tried to
protect myself against that was to make sure</a>
01:32:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h32m31s">I drew from enough sources so that the probability

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h32m42s">if that's true. I'll tell you roughly, the
dimensions of analysis. The ideas that I'm</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h32m52s">going to talk to you about, I've put into
practice personally. They work for me. They</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h32m56s">work for the people that I've taught them
to, so those are family members often, but</a>
01:32:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h33m00s">not only family members, lots of other people
because I'm also a clinician right? So it</a>
01:33:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h33m04s">seems to work quite nicely. I have a lot of
people write to to me and tell me the ideas</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h33m09s">have worked. So, I've got multi rater reliability.
And then, I think it's manifest biologically,</a>
01:33:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h33m20s">and I think it's manifest culturally, and
I think it's manifested in these very, very</a>

You know, make up your own mind, you can see.</a>
01:33:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h33m34s">The other thing - I don't really know what
to do, what to make of this. You know sometimes</a>
01:33:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h33m38s">you have an intuition of truth. It's like

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h33m43s">and they say this seems to be at the heart
of it. They give you a formulation, and it</a>
01:33:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h33m47s">kind of goes click. Yeah, that's how all those
things hang together. It's a pattern recognition</a>
01:33:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h33m53s">mechanism. People generally have the feeling
that when something like that happens, something</a>
01:33:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h33m59s">of truth has been revealed. Now, a very common
response from the students I had in these</a>
01:33:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h34m07s">courses is that I never tell anyone anything

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h34m14s">that, what I'm hoping is the reason, is that
what I'm outlining is archetypal structures</a>
01:34:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h34m19s">and you know, I've drawn a lot of my work

it will happen - is I'll tell you a story,</a>

It's something like that, a decrease in entropy,</a>
01:34:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h34m53s">or something like that. It's a very, very

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h35m33s">philosophy had gone wrong basically since the
time of Socrates which is quite a long time.</a>
01:35:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h35m38s">And he said that we became interested in what
the world was made of, and how we knew things,</a>
01:35:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h35m44s">and what we should've been interested instead
was the nature and quality of being. What</a>
01:35:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h35m50s">he meant by being isn't the objective world.
What he meant by being was the manner in which</a>
01:35:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h35m57s">you have experience. So there are elements
of being that aren't objective elements.</a>
01:35:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h36m04s">So I would say pain is a phenomenological
reality. It's not something you can - you</a>
01:36:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h36m10s">can index it objectively, but the index is
not the phenomena. And you know, is your pain</a>
01:36:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h36m18s">real? This is a question for people who think
there's no such thing as meaning. Like you</a>
01:36:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h36m25s">try to argue yourself out of pain and see
how far you get. You might think, well that's</a>
01:36:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h36m29s">not the sort of meaning I meant. Well you
know, a negative meaning is a place to start</a>
01:36:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h36m32s">right? Because if something's negative and
it's real, it does imply that there's something</a>
01:36:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h36m37s">positive that's real. It might be harder to
get a hold of it, but at least it's not pain.</a>
01:36:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h36m41s">But, pain - Descartes, and I'll close with
this. You guys can have a break. Descartes</a>
01:36:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h36m51s">implemented a method called radical doubt
when he went on his philosophical journey.</a>
01:36:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h36m56s">What Descartes looked for was one thing he
couldn't doubt.</a>
01:36:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h36m59s">Cause he was probably clinically depressed</a>
01:36:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h37m01s">and he was doubting everything, like how do
I know the world isn't just a mirage made</a>
01:37:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h37m07s">by an evil demon to obfuscate reality from
me. Well his conclusion was that the one thing</a>
01:37:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h37m14s">that he could not dispute was that he was
and could think. Now I don't think Descartes</a>
01:37:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h37m21s">really meant what we meant by think. I think
he meant more by what we would mean by experience</a>
01:37:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h37m28s">because thought has become a much more narrowly
defined term since the time of Descartes.</a>
01:37:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h37m35s">So I don't think he meant I think therefore
I am, I think he meant something like I experience.</a>
01:37:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h37m40s">I have experience, therefore I am. Regardless
of that, modern people think about it as thought.</a>
01:37:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h37m45s">Heidegger was different. Heidegger basically
said, the one thing you can't dispute is that</a>
01:37:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h37m51s">experience is your experience. It exists.
It's almost by definition, it's like the definition</a>
01:37:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h38m00s">of exist.</a>
01:38:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h38m01s">And then he was interested in what the fundamental
elements of existence were. And they're not</a>
01:38:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h38m07s">atoms, like the fundamental elements of the
objective world. They're more things like</a>
01:38:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h38m12s">pain, and for me that was the thing that stopped
me from doubting. It's like, I cannot doubt</a>
01:38:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h38m18s">the existence of pain. It seems real. I might
say it seems more real than anything else.</a>
01:38:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h38m25s">Now, you might say you don't believe that,
but I would say I don't care what you think</a>
01:38:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h38m29s">you believe. I'll watch you when you're in
pain, and every single one of your actions</a>
01:38:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h38m34s">will indicate that you believe in it. And
not only that, but that you can't not believe</a>
01:38:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h38m39s">in it. It's there, and it's there so much
that that's a meaning.</a>
01:38:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h38m45s">And so it's in that way that Heidegger thought
out existence, or as experience as composed</a>
01:38:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h38m52s">of meaning. So part of the reason this course
is called Maps of Meaning is that because</a>
01:38:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h38m56s">one of the things we're going to look at is
the structure of meaning, and we're going</a>
01:38:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h39m01s">to start with negative meaning because from
my perspective - look you can doubt whether</a>
01:39:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h39m06s">or not good exists. But once I'm done telling
you the things that I know about human history,</a>
01:39:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h39m11s">there won't be a single person in this room
who thinks that evil doesn't exist. And you</a>
01:39:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h39m16s">might think that's a bloody horrible thing
to learn, but it's not. It's unbelievably</a>
01:39:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h39m20s">useful because once you can establish something
that you cannot deny, you can move from that.</a>
01:39:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h39m28s">I think you can hypothesize that if you're
capable of detecting radical evil, I'll tell</a>
01:39:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h39m36s">you about Unit 731, or you can look it up
yourself - I wouldn't recommend it by the</a>
01:39:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h39m42s">way.</a>
01:39:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h39m43s">Once you can identify radical evil and you
think, well that's just - beyond a doubt that's</a>
01:39:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h39m48s">reprehensible. There's no justification for
that whatsoever, no matter what, whenever.</a>
01:39:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h39m54s">Well then you've got something to stand on,
and you can start thinking, well what's the</a>
01:39:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h39m57s">absolute opposite of that thing? It might
be, how is it that you can conduct yourself</a>
01:39:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h40m02s">so that in your sphere of influence, the probability
that anything like that is reduced to the</a>
01:40:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h40m08s">absolute maximum? Well, that's a reasonably
moral question. And I don't think it's something</a>
01:40:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h40m15s">you can dispense with with a casual nihilism.
I don't think a nihilist can dispense with</a>
01:40:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h40m21s">it, because even nihilists suffer. Thank god
for that. It's their only source of potential</a>
01:40:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h40m29s">salvation. Sometimes they notice it - oh I'm
suffering from all this nihilism, maybe that</a>
01:40:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h40m34s">indicates there's something flawed in it.
It's always possible.</a>
01:40:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h40m39s">Okay, so let's take a break. We will come back at, what time is it?</a>
01:40:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h40m44s">2:58</a>
01:40:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjnvtRgpg6g#t=01h40m46s">? Okay. Come back at 3:15. We will see you then. And then I will talk to you more about the technical elements of the class.</a>
