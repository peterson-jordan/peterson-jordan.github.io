<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h03m51s">because of the nature of your experience!

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h03m54s">and you're going into the country,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h04m42s">You couldn't see paradise, if it was right in front of you!"</a>
00:04:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h04m44s">But you might get a glimmer of it!</a>
00:04:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h04m46s">And so you move towards it, and you grow.</a>
00:04:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h04m49s">And then, he next time you open your eyes,
you see a little bit more clearly.</a>
00:04:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h04m53s">And that's what happens, is that
[it] just happens over and over,</a>
00:04:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h04m56s">right? it keeps moving!</a>
00:04:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h04m59s">And so you move like this.</a>
00:04:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h05m03s">But the thing that's so cool, is that</a>
00:05:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h05m04s">"all those zigs and zags", you say,
and each of those zags and zigs is a catastrophe,</a>
00:05:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h05m09s">"I hit a wall, my God! And then I had to die
a little bit, and I barely got back up!"</a>
00:05:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h05m13s">It's a Phoenix transformation
at each... at each turn!</a>
00:05:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h05m17s">And it's painful! But the thing is, is that even though</a>
00:05:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h05m20s">you've... you've traveled 20 miles,
let's say, on that road,</a>
00:05:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h05m24s">and you've only moved 3 miles forward
- you've moved 3 miles forward!</a>
00:05:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h05m29s">Instead of falling backwards, because that's the thing too:</a>
00:05:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h05m32s">is that if you stand still, you fall backwards.</a>
00:05:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h05m36s">You cannot stand still. Because the world
moves away from you, if you stand still.</a>
00:05:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h05m40s">And there's no stasis, there's only backwards.</a>
00:05:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h05m44s">And so, if you're not moving [stutter]
forwards, then you're moving backwards.</a>
00:05:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h05m48s">And that's more...</a>
00:05:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h05m53s">more of the underlying truth,
of the Matthieu principle.</a>
00:05:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h05m56s">"To those who have everything,
more will be given.</a>
00:05:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h05m59s">From those who have nothing,
everything will be taken."</a>
00:05:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h06m02s">It's a warning: Do not stay in one place!</a>
00:06:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h06m08s">Well, as you aig and zag, maybe then... maybe the
cataclysm of each transformation starts to lessen.</a>
00:06:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h06m16s">There's not so much of you,
that has to die with every mistake.</a>
00:06:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h06m21s">And maybe you end up oriented,
at least, reasonably properly.</a>
00:06:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h06m25s">And if you were sensible, that would have been your trip,</a>
00:06:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h06m27s">but it wasn't, right? It's that,</a>
00:06:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h06m29s">and perhaps it's a lot worse than that,
perhaps there's no shortage of backtracking.</a>
00:06:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h06m33s">But it doesn't matter, because as you stumble forward,</a>
00:06:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h06m36s">you- you illuminate and inform yourself.</a>
00:06:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h06m39s">And perhaps, that's partly because
the world is made of information!</a>
00:06:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h06m44s">And if you encounter it, and tangle with it,</a>
00:06:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h06m47s">then it informs you, and then you become informed,</a>
00:06:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Fm1ZJ1CGQ#t=00h06m50s">and then you're "in formation", and then you're ready.</a>
