to begin with.</a>
00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h00m10s">Now, one of the reasons that I began to think
about these sorts of things is because I wanted</a>
00:00:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h00m22s">to understand what it might mean to have a
set of, let’s say a set of values and beliefs</a>
00:00:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h00m32s">(because those two things go together), that
would…</a>
00:00:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h00m36s">I guess part of the question was, is it possible
to develop of system of beliefs that’s outside</a>
00:00:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h00m42s">of the realm of ideology?</a>
00:00:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h00m43s">You know, because one thing you might claim
is that it’s all ideology.</a>
00:00:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h00m52s">Any belief system is ideological.</a>
00:00:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h00m55s">And if you develop a belief system that criticises
other belief systems it just means that you’ve</a>
00:00:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h01m00s">developed a new ideological stance.</a>
00:01:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h01m06s">And there’s some… that’s a good argument,
you know.</a>
00:01:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h01m09s">I can think of a number of ways that it’s
true.</a>
00:01:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h01m12s">One of the things Nietzsche said in the late
1800s was that if you inhabited a belief system,</a>
00:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h01m19s">even a religious system, and you lost faith
in it, not only did you lose faith in that</a>
00:01:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h01m26s">system, but you also potentially lost faith
in systems themselves.</a>
00:01:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h01m31s">And so, it was a meta-collapse, in a sense.</a>
00:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h01m34s">Not only did you lose your belief, but you
lost your belief in beliefs.</a>
00:01:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h01m37s">So you think of the set of all possible beliefs
and then abandoning any hope of relying on</a>
00:01:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h01m44s">those as valid sources of information.</a>
00:01:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h01m51s">You know, so that’s one perspective and
it’s a powerful one, and Nietzsche believed</a>
00:01:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h01m56s">that that was a certain pathway to nihilism,
essentially, or perhaps to a reactionary totalitarianism,</a>
00:01:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h02m02s">but it boils down to the same thing.</a>
00:02:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h02m05s">I’ve been reading this book recently, the
title of which I can’t remember, unfortunately.</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h02m13s">But I’ll tell it to you after class.</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h02m16s">It’s a critique of certain lines of left-wing
ideological thinking, including the existential</a>
00:02:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h02m26s">thought of people like Jean-Paul Sartre, and
Foucault.</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h02m30s">And one of the most trenchant critiques of
Sartre, because he believes that you have</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h02m36s">an absolute freedom, that you’re destined
for freedom, that you’re doomed to it, in</a>
00:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h02m42s">some sense.</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h02m43s">And that part of your existential journey
is to establish an authenticity that’s correct</a>
00:02:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h02m50s">for you.</a>
00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h02m51s">But he doesn’t, he isn’t able really to
give any description of what that should be</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h02m58s">grounded in.</a>
00:02:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h02m59s">And the critic concludes that all Sartre can
do is stand outside of any potential belief</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h03m10s">system and criticise it.</a>
00:03:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h03m12s">And that that’s… there’s nothing in
it for anyone as a consequence of that.</a>
00:03:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h03m17s">It’s only destructive.</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h03m18s">Now, it’s important to remember, with regards
to Sartre, that he viewed other people, to</a>
00:03:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h03m26s">some degree, like the common man, the bourgeoisie,
we might say, as the embodiment of non-freedom,</a>
00:03:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h03m33s">of inauthenticity, and also as a barrier to
genuine authenticity.</a>
00:03:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h03m38s">So he wasn’t willing to give any credence
to the utility of normality.</a>
00:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h03m44s">But I also think he wasn’t able to tolerate
the consequences of his own thought, because</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h03m48s">he was an avid supporter of the communist
party, far after anyone with any reasonable</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h03m54s">moral sense would have stopped doing that.</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h03m56s">So Sartre didn’t really denounce the communists
until the end of the… beginning of the 70s,</a>
00:03:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h04m02s">roughly speaking.</a>
00:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h04m03s">He was never a card-carrying communist, but
he was very left-leaning.</a>
00:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h04m06s">And you know by the 1970s, by the late 60s,
by the early 70s, a lot of the evidence about</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h04m14s">what was going on in Soviet Russia had been
in for 30 years.</a>
00:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h04m19s">So there was really no excuse for not facing
up to that, and trying to understand what</a>
00:04:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h04m25s">it meant.</a>
00:04:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h04m26s">And you know, it would be bad enough if it
was just the Soviet Union, but it wasn’t.</a>
00:04:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h04m29s">The same sort of thing happened wherever those
utopian presuppositions were put into place.</a>
00:04:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h04m38s">And I suppose many of you don’t know this,
but Pol Pot, who was the Cambodian dictator,</a>
00:04:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h04m43s">was educated at the Sorbonne, and he wrote
his thesis (I think it was his PhD thesis,</a>
00:04:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h04m51s">although it might have been his Master’s
thesis) on the Marxist doctrine that urban</a>
00:04:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h05m00s">people were parasites on rural people.</a>
00:05:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h05m04s">So you know, there’s a theory that says
that the general value is generated purely</a>
00:05:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h05m10s">by labour, and much of that is rural labour,
and the cities siphon off the excess productive</a>
00:05:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h05m15s">power and are able to parasitize the countryside
as a consequence of that.</a>
00:05:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h05m21s">Which is a, you know, tremendously non-productive
theory.</a>
00:05:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h05m28s">But Pol Pot put it in practice, and so when
he went back to Cambodia he chased everybody</a>
00:05:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h05m33s">out of the cities and killed about six million
people.</a>
00:05:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h05m36s">So, you know, you can read about that if you
want.</a>
00:05:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h05m39s">It’s a pretty appalling section of 20th
century history.</a>
00:05:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h05m42s">Especially when it was the case that he was
educated in the West and had these presuppositions</a>
00:05:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h05m50s">drummed into him.</a>
00:05:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h05m52s">Well then there’s Foucault.</a>
00:05:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h05m56s">Foucault, who I have no respect for, by the
way…</a>
00:05:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h06m00s">I’ve read a fair bit of Foucault, and I
think everything he says is obvious.</a>
00:06:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h06m04s">So for example, he criticises the idea of
mental illness as a social construct.</a>
00:06:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h06m11s">It’s like, well yeah, obviously.</a>
00:06:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h06m14s">I mean, it’s not like psychiatrists and
psychologists and mental health professionals,</a>
00:06:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h06m19s">who are relatively well-informed, haven’t
known about that since… for the last 60</a>
00:06:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h06m24s">years.</a>
00:06:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h06m25s">I mean, it might be a revelation to people
who don’t notice that psychiatry, for example,</a>
00:06:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h06m33s">is something like a compromise between the
patient biology and the social world.</a>
00:06:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h06m39s">You know, I mean, psychiatric ailments often
have a biological tilt, but the way they manifest</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h06m46s">themselves in society is clearly conditioned
in very intense ways by the particular conditions</a>
00:06:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h06m54s">obtaining at the point that the person who
has that biological predisposition exists,</a>
00:06:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h06m59s">even when it’s not pathological, can be
tilted one way or another by cultural norms.</a>
00:06:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h07m05s">And then of course, when you’re dealing
with issues like insurance payment, and treatment,</a>
00:07:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h07m10s">and hospitalisation, obviously you’re pulling
in all sorts of systems that are by no means</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h11m48s">Okay, so, well what’s the issue?</a>
00:11:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h11m52s">The issue is that it’s… so the same critic,
with regards to Foucault, said that well it’s</a>
00:11:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h11m59s">basically the same thing, that Foucault criticised
a variety of profound institutions.</a>
00:11:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h12m09s">Sexual institutions say, like marriage, and
then institutions of power, like prisons,</a>
00:12:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h12m14s">and institutions of mental health, like the
whole institutional framework.</a>
00:12:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h12m19s">He criticised them on the basis of power and
exclusion.</a>
00:12:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h12m22s">And you could do that and there’s some truth
in it.</a>
00:12:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h12m27s">But you know Foucault also made the presupposition,
and the problem with that presupposition,</a>
00:12:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h12m32s">that everything is about something else, is
that it’s almost impossible to see how it</a>
00:12:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h12m37s">can’t be applied to Foucault himself.</a>
00:12:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h12m39s">So you’d have to ask, if you were a student
of Foucault, what power aims drove his attempt</a>
00:12:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h12m46s">to analyse everything in terms of power?</a>
00:12:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h12m49s">And I actually think with Foucault it’s
pretty obvious.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h12m53s">But it’s a game that never goes anywhere.</a>
00:12:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h12m55s">Okay, so I thought about that a lot, it’s
like, is there any system that you can develop</a>
00:12:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h13m03s">that doesn’t have the negative consequences
of systems in general?</a>
00:13:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h13m07s">And then if that is possible, how and why
might it be possible?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h13m11s">And this is partly why I’m talking to you
about this particular diagram again.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h13m18s">I think the reason, now I don’t know this,

00:13:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h13m22s">I mean, lots of people have talked to me about
the content of this course and you know, they’ve</a>
00:13:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h13m26s">said that it’s been very helpful for them
when it comes to interpreting certain elements</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h13m35s">But some people have said well it’s just
another system.</a>

00:13:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h13m41s">I think it’s a meta-system.</a>
00:13:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h13m43s">And I don’t think the rules that apply to

00:13:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h13m51s">So you’re going to have to decide that for
yourself.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h13m53s">But I think the reason that I can make that
claim, and that it’s a valid claim is because</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h15m19s">And you know, it was a very cool documentary

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h15m23s">She went down there and she interviewed all
these working guys and they talked about how</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h15m26s">their lives had been brought to a halt by

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h15m29s">And obviously it sucked that they were sitting
around doing nothing and not being paid for</a>

00:15:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h15m37s">is what they wanted to do.</a>
00:15:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h15m39s">So she went down there and laid out their

00:15:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h15m44s">and good, you know, fair enough, good.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h15m47s">But then she went and interviewed the guy
who owned the factory and she didn’t ask</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h16m40s">Like, there’s a lot of interesting things

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h16m44s">None of it, none of it happened.</a>
00:16:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h16m46s">And so, to me what happened was that she was
someone with neglect.</a>
00:16:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h16m51s">You know, she was looking at the world but

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h16m55s">And the half she saw was probably perfectly
justifiable, had its proper domain of application,</a>
00:16:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h17m04s">but the half she missed, well, what about
that part of the story?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h17m09s">You’re going to reduce that to cliché and

00:17:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h17m15s">Well, the only reason you’d do that is if
you didn’t want to find out what the hell</a>
00:17:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h17m19s">was going on.</a>

plenty of situations where workers, the conditions</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h17m31s">of workers are absolutely abysmal.</a>
00:17:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h17m33s">I mean, one of the books I’ve read that
I think a remarkable documentation of that</a>
00:17:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h17m38s">is a book by George Orwell called ‘Road

00:17:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h17m49s">And the idea that they were exploited, well,
that’s a tougher one, because the Industrial</a>

because of the existence of absolute poverty</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h18m12s">is not all that obvious.</a>
00:18:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h18m14s">And you know… so it’s a complicated issue.</a>
00:18:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h18m18s">Now there’s lots of times when workers were
clearly exploited, but I think there are times</a>
00:18:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h18m24s">as well when they weren’t.</a>
00:18:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h18m25s">Anyways, it’s a great book, and he does
a lovely job of laying out a rationale for</a>
00:18:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h18m31s">why the workers should be treated far better
than they were treated, and you know, so fine,</a>
00:18:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h18m36s">good, wonderful.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h18m38s">There’s something to be said.</a>
00:18:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h18m41s">But the thing is when you want to say something,
you want to take an unbiased sample if you</a>

mode of conceptualisation, and I think it’s…</a>
00:18:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h18m51s">the reason I think it’s not an intellectual

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h18m56s">naturally out of the structure of mythology
and narrative, and you can think this through</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h19m07s">archetypal characters.</a>
00:19:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h19m09s">And the thing about a comprehensive narrative
is it can’t leave out an archetypal character,</a>

is extraordinarily complicated, but I think</a>
00:29:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h29m29s">it’s partly because, say snakes shed their
own skin, so they can be reborn, so they’re</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h29m47s">In overcoming that threat, you also develop.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h29m55s">And that’s partly why the snake is such
an ambivalent figure in most mythology.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h30m01s">Okay, so that’s complicated, but we’ll
return to that later.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h30m07s">And then out of that, you might say, emerges
the unknown as you encounter it.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h30m14s">So there’s potential itself, and then the
first layer of potential are the things that</a>
00:30:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h30m20s">you encounter that you don’t understand.</a>
00:30:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h30m23s">So I can give you an example of that.</a>
00:30:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h30m25s">So let’s say you’re a three-year-old,
or a two-year-old, that’s better, and you’re</a>
00:30:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h30m28s">in the kitchen and a mouse runs across the

00:30:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h30m31s">And so you track it because your eyes pick
up the movement, and you track the thing.</a>
00:30:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h30m36s">And then it’s an unexpected occurrence,
so you don’t know what it signifies, right.</a>
00:30:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h30m41s">So that’s the emergence of something tangibly
unknown into your conceptual space.</a>
00:30:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h30m46s">Now it’s not like you lack any knowledge

00:30:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h30m50s">You can tell what its size is, and you can

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h30m57s">And I think what you have to do when you think
about whether or not something is unknown</a>
00:30:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h31m01s">is you have to think about it in relationship

known.</a>
00:31:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h31m20s">You know how to interact with it at a micro-level,
and you know what its implications are for</a>
00:31:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h31m28s">every other level of your conceptual being.</a>

00:31:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h31m34s">Like you know exactly how to deal with that
thing, it’s mapped at every single level.</a>
00:31:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h31m37s">There’s other things that are only mapped
at one level and not at others.</a>
00:31:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h31m41s">So maybe the mouse, we’ll say, for the child
who’s never seen a mouse, it’s like…</a>
00:31:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h31m46s">it shares some commonalities with objects
that the child is familiar with.</a>
00:31:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h31m52s">But there’s sufficient novelty so that it’s
also contaminated with the unknown, and that</a>
00:31:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h31m57s">makes the child, basically, semi-startled
and alert.</a>
00:31:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h32m02s">Now the child will immediately refer to an
adult, and it’s a technical term, actually,</a>
00:32:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h32m08s">they’ll look at the adult’s face because
the adult broadcasts the motivational affective</a>
00:32:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h32m15s">significance of that event.</a>
00:32:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h32m16s">And so the child looks, references, and then
reads off the face (and of course the speech</a>
00:32:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h32m23s">and the bodily actions) exactly what that
thing signifies.</a>
00:32:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h32m27s">And then if the person that they’re looking
at jumps up on the table and screams, then</a>
00:32:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h32m31s">that’s one sense of meaning, which is ‘God,
this thing is magical, it’s only this big</a>
00:32:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h32m36s">and look at what effect it has on, you know,
my aunt (for the sake of argument), who’s</a>
00:32:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h32m42s">you know, a pretty competent creature as far
as I can tell, being two years old’.</a>
00:32:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h32m46s">And then if she just dismisses it, you know,
her actions are going to determine the meaning</a>
00:32:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h32m51s">of that phenomenon.</a>
00:32:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h32m53s">So that’s how the transformation of the
semi-known thing into the more-known thing</a>
00:32:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h33m00s">occurs.</a>
00:33:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h33m01s">It occurs almost always in a social context.</a>
00:33:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h33m04s">You can explore things by yourself, but you
rarely actually do that by yourself.</a>
00:33:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h33m08s">It’s almost always you plugged into a social
apparatus, you know.</a>
00:33:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h33m14s">So you might be doing the specific investigating,
but the social apparatus is around you so</a>
00:33:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h33m19s">that you can confer with it, and it also shapes
the way that you’re going to interact with</a>
00:33:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h33m24s">that specific thing.</a>
00:33:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h33m26s">Okay, so the unknown, that’s generally…
the unknown that you encounter, that’s generally</a>
00:33:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h33m37s">characterised using feminine symbolism.</a>
00:33:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h33m40s">And I think the reason for that, there’s
a bunch of reasons, and we talked about many</a>
00:33:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h33m44s">of them.</a>
00:33:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h33m46s">One reason is because females do the sexual
selection in human beings, and so they act</a>
00:33:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h33m51s">as the face of nature.</a>
00:33:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h33m52s">Another reason is that you can think of new
possibility always emerging out of the non-cultural</a>
00:33:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h33m59s">background, in some sense.</a>
00:33:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h34m01s">So for example, let’s say that we send an
expedition to Mars, and we’re gathering</a>
00:34:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h34m08s">new information as a consequence.</a>
00:34:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h34m10s">The reason we’re gathering new information
is because we’ve gone out past the domain</a>
00:34:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h34m14s">of our knowledge, in a sense, and we’re
interacting with something new.</a>
00:34:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h34m18s">And in that interaction, new information is
generated.</a>
00:34:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h34m22s">Now you can say that it’s partly the act
of the perceiver that’s generating the new</a>
00:34:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h34m26s">information, and you can say that it’s partly
the act of the culture.</a>
00:34:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h34m30s">Because we sent robots to Mars, let’s say,
which is very, very difficult.</a>
00:34:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h34m34s">So the culture goes there but the individuals
are observing, so the individuals are buttressed</a>
00:34:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h34m40s">by the culture.</a>
00:34:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h34m41s">But they’re generating information because
they’re somewhere truly new.</a>
00:34:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h34m44s">And so the information… the unknown is a
constant source of new information.</a>
00:34:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h34m49s">So it’s a place that gives birth to new
information.</a>
00:34:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h34m52s">And so that’s another part of the reason
that it seems to be symbolised in feminine</a>
00:34:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h34m56s">form.</a>
00:34:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h34m57s">You know, I’m just taking this, in some
sense, as an empirical fact.</a>
00:34:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h35m02s">I’ve looked at… it looks like that’s
how these stories work.</a>
00:35:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h35m07s">And so I’ve been trying to puzzle out why
exactly that would be the case.</a>
00:35:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h35m11s">I also think it’s the case that we tend
to look at the world from a social cognitive</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h35m18s">We filter it through a social, cognitive,
biological apparatus.</a>
00:35:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h35m22s">And so we’re very likely to see things in
character form, and characters have sexes,</a>
00:35:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h35m29s">and so that’s going to happen.</a>
00:35:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h35m31s">And then which, the attributes of femininity
or the attributes of masculinity, that get</a>
00:35:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h35m36s">used as symbolic reference in some sense,
there’s an arbitrariness involved.</a>
00:35:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h35m41s">So for example, for the Egyptians… you know,
usually have a sky god, but they had a sky</a>
00:35:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h35m47s">goddess.</a>
00:35:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h35m48s">Now, she usually represents the night sky,
which is not exactly the same thing as the</a>
00:35:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h35m51s">day sky, but you have to... it’s so tricky
because you have to look at the relationships</a>
00:35:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h35m58s">between the characters in order to decide
what all of them mean, and that shifts a little</a>
00:35:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h36m02s">bit from story to story.</a>
00:36:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h36m04s">So this is a, what would you say, it’s an
approximation of the underlying structure,</a>
00:36:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h36m09s">but there’s a fair bit of variation in it,
just like there’s variance in stories.</a>
00:36:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h36m16s">Well the feminine element has a destructive
element and a creative aspect.</a>
00:36:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h36m20s">And you can see that people characterise their
environments in that way.</a>
00:36:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h36m27s">So for example, you can map on environmental
beliefs onto this structure.</a>
00:36:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h36m33s">You can say that the environmentalist portrays
nature as positive, portrays culture as negative,</a>
00:36:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h36m42s">and portrays the individual as negative.</a>
00:36:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h36m43s">And the basic story is rampaging individual
as member of rapacious culture invading the</a>
00:36:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h36m52s">pristine landscape of beautiful Mother Nature.</a>
00:36:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h36m56s">Now the thing about that story is it’s true.</a>
00:36:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h37m00s">The problem with that story is that it’s
half true.</a>
00:37:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h37m04s">So for example, one thing that’s interesting
to conceptualise is that that’s exactly</a>
00:37:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h37m08s">the opposite of the frontier myth.</a>
00:37:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h37m11s">Now the frontier myth was a story that was
used extensively in Europe to drive immigration</a>
00:37:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h37m17s">into the United States.</a>
00:37:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h37m18s">And it was used to some degree in Canada too.</a>
00:37:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h37m20s">And so the story was the exact opposite.</a>
00:37:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h37m22s">It’s the hero, so that would be the immigrant
pioneer, bringing the benefits of order to</a>
00:37:22</p>

00:37:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h37m30s">Well that’s also true, but it’s so interesting
that both of those things can be true, and</a>
00:37:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h37m37s">they’re completely different from one another.</a>
00:37:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h37m39s">There’s no commonality at all between those
two stories, except for the way that they</a>
00:37:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h37m44s">use the characters.</a>
00:37:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h37m45s">There’s a feminine character, a masculine
character (that represents culture), and then</a>
00:37:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h37m50s">there’s another character that represents
the individual.</a>
00:37:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h37m53s">And you could even see that, if you think
about it historically, the US was founded</a>
00:37:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h37m58s">in some sense on the frontier myth, and that
was to one side.</a>
00:37:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h38m02s">And so by the time the 1960s came along, the
early 1960s, it shifted to its opposite.</a>
00:38:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h38m08s">And you need that, because systems have to
oscillate to some degree to remain stable</a>
00:38:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h38m15s">across time.</a>
00:38:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h38m16s">They can’t just be fixed in place.</a>
00:38:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h38m18s">So they’re going to play back and forth
through the archetypes in an attempt to keep</a>
00:38:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h38m22s">them balanced because that’s what you’re
trying to do, you’re trying to keep them</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h38m26s">balanced.</a>
00:38:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h38m28s">And so, you have the destructive and creative
element of Mother Nature.</a>
00:38:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h38m32s">You see that all the time in movies where
the thing that the hero is striving against</a>
00:38:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h38m40s">is the negative element of the unknown.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h38m43s">How many of you have seen the movie ‘Alien’?</a>
00:38:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h38m45s">Okay so that’s a pretty graphic representation
of, well those aliens were more reptilian</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h38m51s">in form, so they’re almost like… they’re
more at the dragon of chaos level of civilisation,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h39m13s">Avatar is exactly the opposite of that, where
you know, the unknown nature is just nothing</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h39m24s">And the culture is portrayed as spear-headed
by greedy and rapacious individuals who are</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h39m30s">basically manifestations of the military industrial

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h39m33s">The funny thing is that those both made good

00:39:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h39m37s">And that’s because… well, it’s because
they have enough archetypal truth so that</a>
00:39:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h39m43s">there’s many situations that they’re relevant

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h39m47s">You know, sometimes Mother Nature is your

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h40m16s">And whether it’s positive or negative depends
on what stance you take towards it and how</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h40m23s">And so the other thing that’s really interesting
about mythology, and this is the lovely element</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h40m28s">of mythology, is that part of what it does

00:41:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h41m05s">And then the archetypal individual has the

is you can say ‘okay yeah, but where are</a>
00:42:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h42m36s">the missing pieces?</a>
00:42:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h42m38s">Where are they going?’</a>
00:42:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h42m39s">Because if they’re not included then they’re
generally projected onto something.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h42m43s">Because they’re there, you can’t get away
from them, they’re there.</a>
00:42:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h42m46s">How does the person account for them?</a>
00:42:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h42m49s">Alright, so now I want to tell you another
story.</a>
00:42:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h42m55s">So we talked about the Mesopotamian creation
myth last week, and now I want to tell you</a>
00:42:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h42m59s">about the Egyptian myth of sovereignty.</a>
00:42:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h43m01s">And so, the first thing I should do is say
that all of the stories that I’m talking</a>
00:43:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h43m07s">to you about have all sorts of variance.</a>
00:43:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h43m11s">And so, the Egyptian story that I’m going
to describe lasted for thousands and thousands</a>
00:43:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h43m17s">of years, and so it isn’t like there was
only one variation of it, there’s all sorts</a>
00:43:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h43m21s">of variations of it, and I’m only going
to tell you one of them.</a>
00:43:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h43m24s">And that’s a limitation, but that’s just
how it is for the time being.</a>
00:43:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h43m29s">So I’m not saying that this is the only
version of this story.</a>
00:43:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h43m34s">But it’s a version, and it’s the one I’m
most familiar with, and so I can talk about</a>
00:43:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h43m39s">it, hopefully with some utility.</a>
00:43:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h43m42s">And it’s a great story.</a>
00:43:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h43m44s">When I finally figured out what it meant…
it’s so cool, with some of these stories</a>
00:43:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h43m48s">if you crack them, and you’re able to see
what they mean, they’re absolutely overwhelming.</a>
00:43:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h43m53s">They’re so bloody brilliant, it’s no wonder
that people regard them as revelatory, you</a>
00:43:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h43m59s">know, of divine origin, because they have
such power that it’s almost impossible to</a>
00:43:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h44m04s">imagine how that could’ve got there.</a>
00:44:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h44m06s">Now, I provide you with the Darwinian explanation
of how that got there, right, because the</a>
00:44:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h44m11s">stories are representations of social contracts
and behavioural tendencies that have evolved</a>
00:44:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h44m17s">over thousands and thousands of years.</a>
00:44:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h44m20s">Because of that, the representation, the story’s
going to have way more information in it than</a>
00:44:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h44m25s">a typical story might.</a>
00:44:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h44m27s">But I still can understand how these things
burst upon people with the force of revelation.</a>
00:44:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h44m33s">One of the things that’s quite interesting
too, if you look at cultures historically,</a>
00:44:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h44m38s">is that you usually find that the revelation
of the story… it’s like the energy source</a>
00:44:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h44m43s">on which the culture feeds.</a>
00:44:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h44m45s">So the story comes first, it has this tremendous
dynamic energy.</a>
00:44:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h44m50s">The culture basically uses that energy to
propel itself through time, you know, to give</a>
00:44:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h44m55s">itself conviction and force.</a>
00:44:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h44m57s">And then at some point the story exhausts
itself, and that would be equivalent, in some</a>
00:44:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h45m01s">sense, I suppose, to Nietzsche’s announcement
of the death of God.</a>
00:45:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h45m04s">And this has happened many times.</a>
00:45:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h45m07s">Alright, so there’s four main characters
in the Egyptian story.</a>
00:45:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h45m14s">There’s Osiris, Isis, Set, and Horus.</a>
00:45:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h45m21s">Now, Osiris, we’ll start with Osiris, but
you could start with any of the characters,</a>
00:45:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h45m27s">because one of the things that’s quite interesting
about mythology is that the myths don’t</a>
00:45:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h45m31s">make any distinction between the causal priority
of these characters.</a>
00:45:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h45m35s">Any of them can be regarded as fundamental.</a>
00:45:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h45m39s">So the hero is the person who separates the
world parents for example, and brings being</a>
00:45:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h45m44s">into existence.</a>
00:45:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h45m45s">But you can also say well it’s Tiamat, which
is more how the Mesopotamian creation myth</a>
00:45:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h45m52s">is tilted, or you can say you can’t make
sense out of anything unless you have a cultural</a>
00:45:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h45m57s">lens through which you’re looking.</a>
00:45:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h45m59s">Like there has to be some pre-existent structure
before information can be generated in any</a>
00:45:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h46m05s">manner.</a>
00:46:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h46m06s">So you’re always stuck with this problem,
that in order for something to exist you need</a>
00:46:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h46m10s">a substrate, you need an interpretive substructure,
and you need an interpreter.</a>
00:46:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h46m17s">And you can’t say that one of those thing
precedes the other.</a>
00:46:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h46m20s">They all have to be there at the same time.</a>
00:46:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h46m23s">You could say from a Darwinian perspective,
they all emerged and complexified in unison</a>
00:46:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h46m30s">as time progressed.</a>
00:46:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h46m34s">It doesn’t explain how the origin originated,
however.</a>
00:46:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h46m38s">Okay, so you’ve got Osiris.</a>
00:46:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h46m41s">Now Osiris is the founder of the Egyptian
state.</a>
00:46:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h46m45s">And so, you know, before people wrote things
down, you have to kind of try to understand</a>
00:46:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h46m53s">how it was that they remembered things.</a>
00:46:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h46m59s">Their memory was more like an amalgam, or
a gist.</a>
00:46:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h47m04s">So we already know that if you tell the story
of your actions yesterday that it doesn’t</a>
00:47:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h47m11s">take you 16 hours to tell the story.</a>
00:47:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h47m14s">Hopefully it takes you like five minutes.</a>
00:47:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h47m17s">And why that is is not obvious, but part of
the reason is, for whatever underlying reasons,</a>
00:47:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h47m26s">you know what parts of the story are relevant
to other people, and what parts aren’t.</a>
00:47:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h47m31s">So basically what you’re going to do is
try not to tell them things they already know.</a>
00:47:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h47m36s">Because that would just be pointless.</a>
00:47:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h47m37s">And in order to do that you more or less have
to know what they know and what they don’t</a>
00:47:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h47m42s">know.</a>
00:47:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h47m43s">And you have to more or less stay on the edge
of that.</a>
00:47:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h47m44s">But you can do that.</a>
00:47:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h47m45s">Well, I might ask you, well what did you do
over the last three months, or I could say</a>
00:47:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h47m51s">what have you done for the last couple of
years?</a>
00:47:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h47m53s">And in each case you’re going to collapse
that into some representation.</a>
00:47:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h47m57s">Now imagine that the problem you’re trying
to solve is ‘what did your culture try to</a>
00:47:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h48m01s">do for the last five thousand years?’</a>
00:48:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h48m04s">Well imagine that there are… the culture
in part is being continually informed by the</a>
00:48:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h48m15s">individuals that compose it.</a>
00:48:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h48m17s">And there’re going to be different individuals
of different stature who discover things of</a>
00:48:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h48m22s">different importance.</a>
00:48:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h48m24s">And we often know some people like that.</a>
00:48:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h48m26s">We know of Thomas Edison, for example, and
we can name actual people.</a>
00:48:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h48m30s">But that’s in part because we write things
down and have records of them.</a>
00:48:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h48m33s">You can imagine though that you’re trying
to represent your history in a way that you</a>
00:48:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h48m40s">can remember.</a>
00:48:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h48m41s">You’re going to tell stories about people
who have done interesting things, because</a>
00:48:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h48m45s">that’s what you even when you tell a story
about yourself.</a>
00:48:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h48m48s">So imagine you tell one story about someone
who did something interesting and then you</a>
00:48:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h48m52s">tell another story about someone else who
did something interesting, and so forth.</a>
00:48:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h48m55s">And that’s continually going on, let’s
say, in a tribal or archaic culture.</a>
00:48:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h49m01s">So then what you get is a set of stories about
people doing interesting things.</a>
00:49:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h49m05s">Well, it’s easy for that to shift into the
ancestors doing interesting things.</a>
00:49:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h49m12s">And then it’s easy for that to shift into
the ancestor doing wonderful things.</a>
00:49:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h49m17s">And that’s basically what happens, is that
you get the emergence of the culture story,</a>
00:49:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h49m22s">which is something like a small set of cultural
heroes who have done all the things that are</a>
00:49:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h49m27s">worth doing.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h51m12s">And the way that he’s specifically blind
is that he’s wilfully blind.</a>

00:51:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h51m37s">So for example, if you run a company and you

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h52m26s">And you might say, ‘well I can’t be culpable

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h52m52s">Now there’s an idea here.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h52m56s">So Osiris is the state manifested in personified
form, and that’s reasonable, because the</a>
00:52:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h53m05s">state is like a person.</a>
00:53:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h53m07s">The person of the state is manifested in the
body of laws, and you guys all imitate that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h53m15s">body of laws, and that’s what basically

00:53:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h53m27s">So that’s what makes you citizens of the

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h53m39s">And that’s why you can predict each other.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h53m43s">Now the problem with being a good citizen
is that sometimes if you’re a good citizen</a>

that were intrinsic to the state.</a>
00:54:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h54m31s">Now you remember, in the Mesopotamian creation

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h54m42s">Well you can imagine that that would be the

00:54:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h54m47s">that was somewhat fragile.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h55m02s">Now they’re partly concerned about that,
because remember Marduk, the emperor, is supposed</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h55m11s">But the myth, the mythic structure only talks
about Apsu a tiny little bit, it basically</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h55m17s">says ‘don’t kill Tiamat’s consort or

to flood mythology.</a>
00:57:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h57m50s">So here’s an example.</a>
00:57:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h57m51s">There are flood myths all over the world,
and there may have even been a flood, there’s</a>
00:57:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h57m55s">pretty good archeological evidence for that,
that there was a great flood about 13,000</a>
00:57:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h58m00s">years ago, when a bunch of comets hit the
Earth and melted the North American ice shield,</a>
00:58:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h58m04s">but we won’t get into that.</a>
00:58:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h58m05s">But it doesn’t really matter, because the
mythological sub-structure of the story still</a>
00:58:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h58m10s">has the same meaning regardless of its historical
reality.</a>
00:58:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h58m15s">So in the Biblical story of the flood, basically
what happens is that humanity is created,</a>
00:58:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h58m20s">then they degenerate rapidly.</a>
00:58:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h58m22s">And they get so degenerate, which is sort
of like the elder Gods getting out of hand</a>
00:58:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h58m27s">in the Mesopotamian story, that God thinks,
‘oh to hell with all of you, you’re a</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h58m31s">big mistake, I’m just going to wipe you

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h58m35s">But he finds one good guy, that’s Noah,
and out of Noah, who’s like another Adam,</a>
00:58:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h58m40s">in some sense, the world of human beings is
regenerated.</a>
00:58:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h58m43s">But the idea is that corrupt people get washed
away.</a>
00:58:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h58m50s">And Eliade talks about the flood myth all
over the world, Mircea Eliade, and he says</a>
00:58:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h58m56s">that generally speaking there’s two reasons
why the deities flood the planet.</a>
00:58:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h59m02s">And one is the system is old and out-dated,
and the second is that people are corrupt.</a>
00:59:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h59m07s">And then if you get the two things working
together, you get a system that’s out of</a>
00:59:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h59m10s">date that becomes pathological faster because
people are corrupt.</a>
00:59:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h59m15s">And so I think that you can use the flood
in New Orleans as a good example of that.</a>
00:59:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h59m19s">Because on the one hand you can say, well
it was a hurricane.</a>
00:59:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h59m24s">So that’s a natural disaster.</a>
00:59:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h59m25s">But on the other hand you could say, well
people knew the damn dykes were too weak,</a>
00:59:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h59m32s">and they didn’t do anything about it, you
know, they were only built for a hundred year</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h59m36s">storm.</a>
00:59:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h59m37s">And Louisiana is corrupt beyond belief, I
mean, for a democratic state, it’s not corrupt</a>
00:59:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h59m42s">compared to most states, but it’s really
corrupt compared to most democratic states,</a>
00:59:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h59m45s">and if you dump money into Louisiana it just
goes into people’s pockets anyways and the</a>
00:59:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h59m49s">infrastructure doesn’t get fixed up.</a>
00:59:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h59m51s">So then you might ask yourself, well was the
flood a consequence of a natural disaster,</a>
00:59:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h59m55s">or the blindness of the culture?</a>
00:59:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=00h59m58s">Well, you can never tell which of those are
true.</a>
00:59:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h00m00s">If you freeze to death in the winter is it
because it’s cold or because you’re stupid?</a>
01:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h00m06s">You know, there’s no difference between
those two things.</a>
01:00:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h00m10s">So if you get wiped out, it’s because nature
comes after you and because your culture isn’t</a>
01:00:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h00m15s">sufficient to protect.</a>
01:00:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h00m17s">And so you can’t separate those two things.</a>
01:00:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h00m19s">Okay, so… now the other case that the Egyptians
are making, and this is quite cool, is that</a>
01:00:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h00m26s">if you take a system that’s doing just fine,
and you just leave it alone long enough, it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h00m32s">becomes dysfunctional.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h00m35s">And there is a bunch of reasons for that.</a>
01:00:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h00m36s">I mean, you know, you can imagine that you
take your laptop, and it’s in perfect working</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h00m48s">Well, it’ll still turn on.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h00m50s">Do you have a laptop?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h00m52s">Well no, by then it won’t even work, it
won’t be able to communicate with the internet,</a>
01:00:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h00m58s">there won’t be any peripherals that could

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h01m03s">Like it’s a brick, basically.</a>
01:01:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h01m06s">And so the point is that, and you can really
see this with electronic equipment, a perfectly</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h01m18s">And so what that means is that you have to
run around like a mad hyena just keeping your</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h09m05s">So anyways, Set, he’s pretending to be Osiris’s
loving brother, but he’s not.</a>
01:09:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h09m11s">He’s plotting to overthrow him first chance
he gets.</a>
01:09:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h09m14s">And so he’s just sitting in the background,
feeding him bad advice, waiting for him to</a>
01:09:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h09m19s">get weak enough so that he can strike.</a>
01:09:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h09m22s">Now the name Set is taken by the Egyptian
Coptics and turned into Satan.</a>
01:09:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h09m28s">So Set is the precursor of the Christian Satan.</a>
01:09:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h09m31s">So the reason I’m telling you that is so
that you can see how these ideas, these archetypal</a>
01:09:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h09m37s">ideas of corruption and evil are extraordinarily
ancient, and they’re part of the process</a>
01:09:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h09m45s">whereby people are trying to figure out what
the right way is to act and what the wrong</a>
01:09:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h09m50s">way is to act, and what the right way is to
set up institutions and what the wrong way</a>
01:09:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h09m54s">is to set up institutions.</a>
01:09:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h09m56s">So it’s a very, very long process.</a>
01:09:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h09m58s">And it’s not something that someone just
sat around and thought up.</a>
01:09:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h10m02s">It’s way, way deeper than that.</a>
01:10:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h10m05s">So anyways, Osiris is being, you know, getting
weaker and being blind, and one day Set thinks</a>
01:10:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h10m12s">‘alright, time for action’, so he takes
his brother and he chops him up into little</a>
01:10:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h10m17s">pieces.</a>
01:10:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h10m18s">Now, Osiris is a god, so you’re not going
to kill him, but you can make it very difficult</a>
01:10:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h10m24s">for him to get his act together.</a>
01:10:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h10m26s">So basically what happens is Osiris falls
apart.</a>
01:10:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h10m29s">Now think about that.</a>
01:10:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h10m32s">You fall apart.</a>
01:10:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h10m35s">People say that.</a>
01:10:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h10m36s">The relationship fell apart.</a>
01:10:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h10m37s">I fell apart.</a>
01:10:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h10m39s">Things fall apart.</a>
01:10:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h10m40s">What does that mean?</a>
01:10:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h10m41s">Well it means that a thing is usually a complex
unity of multiple sub-entities, and sometimes</a>
01:10:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h10m50s">what holds them together, the superordinate
structure, collapses, and all that’s left</a>
01:10:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h10m55s">are the things.</a>
01:10:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h10m56s">Because you know, when you fall apart, you
don’t completely fall apart.</a>
01:10:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h11m01s">You know, you’re still alive.</a>
01:11:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h11m02s">What’s happened is that the unity of your
psychological structure has been fragmented.</a>
01:11:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h11m08s">And that’s a trip to the underworld, man.</a>
01:11:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h11m09s">So you’re going to be unhappy.</a>
01:11:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h11m11s">I broke up with my partner and then I fell
apart.</a>
01:11:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h11m15s">Well everyone knows what that means.</a>
01:11:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h11m16s">Okay, so that’s what happens to Osiris.</a>
01:11:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h11m20s">Things fall apart.</a>
01:11:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h11m22s">So then Set, being a sneaky sort of character,
takes all of Osiris’s pieces and he puts</a>
01:11:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h11m28s">them all over Egypt.</a>
01:11:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h11m29s">He hides them here and there so that Osiris
is going to have a hell of a time recollecting</a>
01:11:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h11m34s">himself and getting his act together and coming
back.</a>
01:11:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h11m38s">And so, things fall apart.</a>
01:11:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h11m41s">Now the same thing happens in The Lion King,
obviously, because Scar kills Mufasa.</a>
01:11:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h11m47s">So fine, then Set rules.</a>
01:11:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h11m55s">That’s not a good day for the Egyptians.</a>
01:11:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h11m57s">Remember what happens in The Lion King when
Scar rules?</a>
01:11:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h12m02s">The environment becomes completely devastated
because they overhunt, right?</a>
01:12:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h12m05s">So you get total environmental devastation.</a>
01:12:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h12m08s">It’s all black and burnt.</a>
01:12:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h12m11s">And, you know, nothing is functioning properly.</a>
01:12:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h12m13s">And remember after Simba comes back to set
things right it starts to rain and everything</a>
01:12:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h12m18s">comes back to life.</a>
01:12:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h12m20s">Well it’s another indication of the idea
that you really can’t separate the environment</a>
01:12:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h12m25s">from the culture, you know, they’re in a
dynamic system of interaction.</a>
01:12:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h12m31s">Anyways, Osiris, things have fallen apart.</a>
01:12:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h12m35s">Well Osiris has a wife, he has to, he’s
King of Order.</a>
01:12:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h12m39s">Well, we’re missing someone, we’re missing
the Queen of Chaos, we’re missing the Queen</a>
01:12:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h12m43s">of the Underworld.</a>
01:12:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h12m44s">That’s Isis.</a>
01:12:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h12m45s">Now Isis was a long-lasting goddess.</a>
01:12:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h12m47s">There’s been goddess religions forever.</a>
01:12:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h12m50s">There’s an idea among misinformed feminist
anthropologists that the original religious</a>
01:12:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h12m59s">structures were feminine, earth-goddess type
religions, and then they were replaced by</a>
01:12:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h13m05s">patriarchal religions.</a>
01:13:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h13m07s">And there’s no historical evidence for that.</a>
01:13:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h13m10s">And the best work I know on that is actually
through the Jungians…</a>
01:13:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h13m15s">Jung and Eric Neumann.</a>
01:13:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h13m16s">Because what they figured out… they’re
kind of on the same track, thinking about</a>
01:13:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h13m20s">the same idea, that there seems to be a shift
between matriarchal values to patriarchal</a>
01:13:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h13m25s">values, and that that was a historical shift.</a>
01:13:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h13m27s">But what they actually found out instead was
that’s a shift in mythological idea.</a>
01:13:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h13m32s">It’s not a historical reality.</a>
01:13:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h13m34s">And it’s useful as a mythological idea but
you shouldn’t project it backwards onto</a>
01:13:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h13m38s">time and make it a historical reality.</a>
01:13:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h13m41s">Anyways, Isis, she’s been Queen of the Underworld
forever.</a>
01:13:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h13m45s">Now of course, when order collapses, chaos
reappears, and that’s what happens.</a>
01:13:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h13m50s">Isis pops up out of the Underworld and her
husband’s missing and she’s not very happy</a>
01:13:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h13m55s">about that.</a>
01:13:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h13m56s">So she wanders all over Egypt looking for
his phallus.</a>
01:13:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h14m00s">And so… now that’s an interesting idea,
because it touches on the biology of innovation,</a>
01:14:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h14m11s">in some sense.</a>
01:14:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h14m12s">So you’ve heard of the notion of a seminal
idea.</a>
01:14:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h14m15s">Well, that’s a mythologically informed metaphor.</a>
01:14:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h14m21s">And so the idea is that, in biological reproduction,
semen falls on fertile ground, and out of</a>
01:14:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h14m29s">that something emerges.</a>
01:14:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h14m32s">Well, there’s a tight analogue between that
and what happens in the Egyptian myth with</a>
01:14:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h14m41s">regards to sexuality.</a>
01:14:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h14m42s">Now, Jung and Freud had a big argument about
this, eh, because Freud thought that you could</a>
01:14:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h14m46s">reduce everything to sexuality.</a>
01:14:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h14m51s">And Jung said no no, what you don’t understand
is that sexuality itself is often used as</a>
01:14:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h14m56s">a symbol for something even more profound.</a>
01:14:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h14m59s">And they didn’t agree on that, and that’s
part of why they went their separate ways.</a>
01:14:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h15m04s">Freud was very much unwilling to believe that
religion could be anything other than a set</a>
01:15:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h15m11s">of defensive and repressive beliefs and practices
designed to protect you from death anxiety.</a>
01:15:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h15m18s">That was basically his hypothesis.</a>
01:15:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h15m23s">And it’s wrong.</a>
01:15:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h15m25s">I mean, there is that element, of course,
because you can use dogma to protect yourself</a>
01:15:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h15m29s">against all sorts of things.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h15m32s">But you can’t reduce a whole damn thing
to that.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h15m34s">You have got to watch people of any type,
that are intellectuals, who will tell you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h21m40s">iris, and usually the pupil is so big that
it covers the whole iris.</a>
01:21:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h21m45s">And there’s a variety of reasons for that,
but one of the reasons is that it symbolises</a>
01:21:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h21m50s">interest and attention.</a>
01:21:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h21m51s">So when you’re interested in something,
your pupil grows.</a>
01:21:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h21m54s">And so Horus’s pupil is really big, and
he’s checking things out like mad.</a>
01:21:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h21m58s">So Horus is the eye, and he’s also a falcon.</a>
01:21:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h22m02s">And you might say, well why is he a falcon?</a>
01:22:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h22m04s">And the answer to that is falcons are birds
of prey, and they can really see.</a>
01:22:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h22m10s">So that’s another amplification of the idea
of the eye.</a>
01:22:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h22m14s">Now falcons fly up above everything, even
above the pyramids.</a>
01:22:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h22m19s">And they can see wherever they want to see,
and so Horus is the thing that flies up above</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h22m23s">the structures of mankind, in some sense,
and can see them panoramically.</a>
01:22:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h22m29s">So he’s not encapsulated in any particular
pyramid, he’s the thing that’s above all</a>
01:22:29</p>

01:22:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h22m39s">And I think the best way to conceptualise
Horus in modern terms is attention.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h22m43s">That’s not thought, that’s a whole different

01:22:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h22m49s">Like attention is what thought… attention
is the precursor to thought, in some sense.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h22m55s">Attention is where you meet meaning, and that’s

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h28m01s">He goes back to the Underworld.</a>
01:28:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h28m03s">And he goes back to where Osiris is existing,
because it’s sort of the land of the dead.</a>
01:28:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h28m08s">And so Osiris has this weird existence.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h28m11s">He’s scattered all over Egypt, but his essence,
I suppose, his spirit, is down there in the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h28m18s">Underworld, which is… it’s not exactly
hell.</a>
01:28:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h28m21s">Hell is a suburb of the Underworld.</a>
01:28:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h28m23s">Like it’s the worst neighbourhood of the
Underworld, that’s a good way of thinking</a>
01:28:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h28m27s">about it.</a>
01:28:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h28m28s">You guys go to the Underworld fairly often.</a>
01:28:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h28m30s">You may take a rare side-trip to hell, and
you probably regret it.</a>
01:28:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h28m36s">And we can talk about that means, because
it actually has a very specific meaning.</a>
01:28:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h28m40s">Anyways, Osiris isn’t in hell, he’s just
in the Underworld.</a>
01:28:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h28m43s">So he’s sitting there sort of, you know,
inactive.</a>
01:28:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h28m48s">And in rough shape.</a>
01:28:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h28m50s">So Horus goes down to the Underworld, and
he finds Osiris, and he gives him an eye!</a>
01:28:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h28m58s">And so then Osiris can see again.</a>
01:28:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h29m00s">Remember, he couldn’t see, he was wilfully
blind, right?</a>
01:29:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h29m03s">And so that’s partly what led to his demise.</a>
01:29:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h29m05s">Horus give him this eye that’s been hard
fought.</a>
01:29:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h29m09s">It’s the eye with which he encountered evil.</a>
01:29:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h29m13s">He gives Osiris that eye, perks him right
up.</a>
01:29:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h29m16s">And so then Horus and Osiris go back to the
surface world, and they unite to form the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h29m24s">ruler of Egypt.</a>
01:29:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h29m26s">And so the idea is that the proper ruler is
obviously the thing that can pay attention</a>
01:29:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h29m31s">and conquer the pathology of the state and
wilful blindness, but it’s more that.</a>
01:29:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h29m36s">It’s the thing that does that and then rejuvenates
the state.</a>
01:29:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h29m41s">And you know, one of the things, I think this
is quite interesting… so the hippie culture</a>

and you can make a case that during the 60s,</a>
01:29:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h29m58s">and the latter part of the 50s, young people’s
attention was very much focused on certain</a>
01:29:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h30m03s">pathological elements of the state.</a>
01:30:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h30m05s">You know, the Civil Rights Movement seemed
to be a real thing, there was a movement towards</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h30m10s">emancipation of women, there were lots of
things that I think you can look at from a</a>

01:30:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h30m19s">But then there was the other element of it,
which was, well, you know, down with the state</a>
01:30:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h30m25s">and don’t trust anyone over 30.</a>
01:30:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h30m27s">Well, that’s kind of stupid, because first
of all it’s not that long till you’re</a>
01:30:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h30m31s">30 and then what do you do?</a>
01:30:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h30m32s">And second, well no, you can’t throw the
damn baby out with the bathwater.</a>
01:30:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h30m37s">I mean first of all, you’re probably doing
that because you don’t want to grow up,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h30m42s">And second, it’s like, you can’t leave
Osiris languishing in the Underworld.</a>
01:30:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h30m50s">You have to give him vision and bring him
back up to the surface.</a>
01:30:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h30m53s">Because I don’t care how attentive you are,
if you’re also not wise you’re not going</a>

01:30:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h31m00s">And the wisdom is partly the integration of
the best your culture has to offer you into</a>
01:31:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h31m05s">your character, so that you can be an avatar

01:31:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h31m12s">And then you’re a well-balanced soul.</a>
01:31:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h31m13s">Well, so the Egyptians figured all this out.</a>
01:31:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h31m16s">And then it’s even cooler than that, because
they used this idea of the union of Horus</a>
01:31:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h31m23s">and Osiris as their conceptual representation
of what gave the Pharaoh sovereignty.</a>
01:31:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h31m31s">Because again, like the Mesopotamians, they
were trying to figure out, well what should</a>
01:31:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h31m35s">rule?</a>
01:31:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h31m36s">What should be above all?</a>
01:31:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h31m38s">And the Mesopotamians figured, well it’s
something like Marduk, he’s got lots of</a>
01:31:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h31m42s">eyes, he can talk, he’s brave, he’ll conquer
the unknown.</a>
01:31:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h31m45s">As a consequence, he makes a pretty good top
god.</a>
01:31:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h31m48s">And the Egyptians added a level of sophistication
to that, because Horus is not only the thing</a>
01:31:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h31m56s">that will go into the Underworld, he goes
into the Underworld and he rescues things</a>
01:31:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h32m00s">of tremendous value and then unites with them,
so that not only can he see, but he’s wise.</a>
01:32:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h32m08s">And so then that’s what the Pharaoh is supposed
to be.</a>
01:32:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h32m10s">And the Egyptians basically characterised
that union as something akin to the immortal</a>
01:32:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h32m14s">soul.</a>
01:32:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h32m15s">Now, Eliade tracks this development, he called
it the ‘democratisation of Osiris’.</a>
01:32:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h32m20s">So first of all, basically only the Pharaoh
was allowed to be the Horus-Osiris union in</a>
01:32:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h32m27s">some sense.</a>
01:32:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h32m28s">And so in a way he was God on Earth, you know,
which is a conception of course that has lasted</a>
01:32:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h32m35s">into cultures for a very, very long period
of time.</a>
01:32:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h32m37s">And the Japanese still thought that way about
their emperor until the end of World War II.</a>
01:32:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h32m41s">Many of them still think that way.</a>
01:32:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h32m43s">So he was the embodiment of divine sovereignty.</a>
01:32:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h32m46s">It was in the leader only.</a>
01:32:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h32m49s">But as the Egyptian state developed, the idea
that that soul was an attribute started to</a>
01:32:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h32m55s">descend down the power hierarchy.</a>
01:32:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h32m57s">So after a while the aristocracy started to
use it.</a>
01:32:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h33m00s">And then, and this is a radical oversimplification,
but it’ll do for the purposes of this discussion,</a>
01:33:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h33m08s">you know by the time the Jews came along,
and they came out of Egypt (mythologically</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h33m14s">speaking), the idea that there could be a
union or a relationship between something</a>
01:33:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h33m20s">that was divine and something that was individual
was distributed a long ways down the power</a>
01:33:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h33m24s">hierarchy.</a>
01:33:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h33m26s">And then by the time the Greeks showed up,
well in some sense it was all males, at least</a>
01:33:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h33m30s">all males who were part of the polity.</a>
01:33:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h33m31s">And when the Christians emerged, it was everyone.</a>
01:33:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h33m36s">Prostitutes, tax collectors, thieves, murderers,
everyone.</a>
01:33:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h33m41s">And so the idea of sovereignty started to
become, you know first of all it was a mythological</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h33m46s">attribute, it was identified with the ruler,
but then it became a psychological attribute</a>
01:33:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h33m51s">that was distributed across the entire population.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h33m56s">And as far as I can tell, those conceptualisations
formed the sub-structure of our belief that</a>

wise, that you can approach things that frighten</a>
01:34:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h34m46s">you with courage, and generate new information
as a consequence.</a>
01:34:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h34m49s">Like there’s lots of things about you that
the relationship between Chaos and Order actually</a>
01:34:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h34m55s">literally depend upon.</a>
01:34:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h34m59s">And so the state has come to respect the individual
partly because the individual is, by necessity,</a>
01:34:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h35m06s">the thing that rejuvenates the state.</a>
01:35:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h35m08s">And so there’s this dynamic relationship
between the two.</a>
01:35:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h35m11s">The state structures you, but it’s old and
it’s blind, and there’s lots of things</a>
01:35:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h35m15s">it can’t see, and it’s partly corrupt.</a>
01:35:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h35m18s">Okay, but it’s hell of a lot better than
nothing, generally speaking, and so then you’re</a>
01:35:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h35m23s">like the forerunner of the state, and you
can pay attention.</a>
01:35:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h35m27s">Maybe you can see where things aren’t working
exactly right, where they’re not working</a>
01:35:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h35m30s">properly, and fix them.</a>
01:35:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h35m32s">And so then the state maintains its protective
structure across time and you exist in a dialectical</a>
01:35:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h35m38s">relationship with it.</a>
01:35:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h35m39s">You know, you see by the time the Christian
hero mythology emerges, Christ is more the</a>
01:35:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h35m46s">reconstructor of the state than he is the
thing that encounters chaos, right?</a>
01:35:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h35m52s">Because a huge chunk of the Christian story
is about the antagonism between him and his</a>
01:35:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h35m58s">culture and the Roman culture as well.</a>
01:35:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h36m00s">So the whole existential drama actually shifts
from hero as buttressing against nature, which</a>
01:36:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h36m07s">of course would have been the case earlier,
to hero as thing that decomposes and reconstructs</a>
01:36:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h36m12s">culture in a radical way.</a>
01:36:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h36m15s">So you know, Moses does the same thing, and
Moses is a master of water, he’s a transformative</a>
01:36:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h36m21s">agent, so it’s an indication of exactly
the same sort of idea.</a>
01:36:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HueFqvz1oDU#t=01h36m26s">That’s a good time for a break.</a>
