<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h03m05s">to make them parody themselves, roughly speaking,</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h03m07s">it was a rough game and</a>

00:03:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h03m21s">you could predict everything they were going to say.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h03m25s">and out would come the proper ideological formulas,</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h03m29s">but then he realized that as soon as they,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h03m32s">let's call it "repented of that", and started to realize</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h03m38s">then he would start communicating with them, you know</a>
00:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h03m41s">as if they were people who you could communicate with,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h03m46s">yeah, so that was very interesting, as far as I'm concerned.</a>
00:03:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h03m49s">Anyways, this kid is still a little bit human, he starts to</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h03m57s">and says that he's not ready yet,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h05m38s">to say the least, but he realizes what's going on.</a>
00:05:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h05m41s">So he runs back to find Pinocchio, and then</a>
00:05:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h05m43s">the scene switches back to the 8 Ball Bar,</a>
00:05:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h05m47s">where, um, Lampwick is drinking beer and complaining about</a>

00:05:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h05m53s">Because he's kind of guilty and ashamed,</a>

00:06:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h06m12s">What does he think? "I am a jackass" or</a>
00:06:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h06m14s">something like that, maybe that's not the words exactly</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h06m16s">and then he grows these ears,</a>
00:06:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h06m19s">and Pinocchio sees that, and immediately takes a look</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h06m22s">at the beer and stops drinking it, and then Lampwick</a>
00:06:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h06m26s">transforms one more time, and his face</a>
00:06:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h06m28s">turns into the face of a donkey, and he's</a>
00:06:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h06m30s">laughing still and then his hands.</a>
00:06:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h06m33s">Oh yes, he laughs and he starts to bray</a>
00:06:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h06m36s">like a jackass and he's horrified by that</a>
00:06:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h06m38s">and then Pinocchio laughs</a>

00:06:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h06m43s">And so now they're absolutely horrified and</a>

00:06:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h06m55s">and there's one particularly, I would say, dramatic scene</a>
00:06:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h06m57s">where his hands have transformed in hooves</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h07m06s">in panic and he comes up to a mirror and</a>
00:07:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h07m08s">sees himself as a jackass and then he</a>
00:07:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h07m10s">turns around and breaks the mirror,</a>
00:07:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h07m12s">so you know, he's self-conscious for a moment</a>
00:07:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h07m14s">then he destroys his capacity for self-consciousness</a>
00:07:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h07m17s">then he transforms entirely into a jackass.</a>
00:07:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymzYIrZAKMc#t=00h07m20s">He's farther down the road than Pinocchio.</a>
