<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h00m07s">As for Joseph, the Ishmaelites took him to Egypt.</a>
00:00:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h00m10s">And he bought it from them an Egyptian whose name was Potiphar.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h00m19s">It may turn out in your mind that in this case he will be indignant about fate</a>
00:00:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h00m23s">There are many reasons for his indignation</a>
00:00:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h00m27s">He is the favorite son before he was sold as a slave owned by his brothers for their betrayal of him</a>
00:00:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h00m31s">Their treachery alone blew the heart, and the anguish increased, and slave became bought and sold</a>

00:00:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h00m41s">And I say that is because I have noticed many people</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h00m45s">Who are still looking for a reason that justifies the corruption of their personalities and morals</a>
00:00:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h00m49s">This is justified. Corruption of your personality means abstaining from self-deterrence</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h00m52s">Then it becomes easy to lie, cheat, theft, betrayal and treat people with cruelty</a>
00:00:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h00m55s">Slipping down the slope of corruption is easier on the soul than resistance and correction</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h00m58s">Lying, not honesty, and sitting, not standing, are easier and easier for oneself</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h01m06s">Where the lack of value and corruption so that staying at the bottom does not require your effort</a>
00:01:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h01m11s">As soon as the incident occurs and the calamity resolves, you will say, "Is this exactly the long-awaited justification?"</a>
00:01:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h01m18s">Then you allow the worst of the self to emerge</a>
00:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h01m21s">This shows Solzhenitsyn's story of his experience as a prisoner in a concentration camp in Russia</a>
00:01:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h01m25s">As soon as the detainee was deposited, he began to monitor the behavior of everyone around him</a>
00:01:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h01m28s">He mentioned in his notes</a>
00:01:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h01m30s">Those who, from the very first moment of their arrest, are transformed in the conditions of detention into informants</a>
00:01:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h01m33s">Or collaborators, and even be a degree of ruggedness and brutality</a>
00:01:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h01m36s">By what they excel even over the official guards</a>
00:01:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h01m38s">And his conclusion of this case is that they have accumulated and stoked resentment</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h01m43s">Then they entrusted him with their souls in the midst of daily life, as they did not have a window of opportunity at that time to express</a>
00:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h01m47s">Because of the hatred in their souls, but as soon as the opportunity arises, what they have entrusted their souls to bear fruit.</a>
00:01:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h01m55s">In the Old Testament a message we find repeated and it is</a>
00:01:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h02m02s">Even if you suffered misfortune and your calamity was great</a>
00:02:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h02m05s">That does not justify that after this calamity, you will turn into a disaffected person who turns his surroundings into hell</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h02m11s">Not only that, but it does not matter how great the calamity I suffered, and whether it was very great</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h02m16s">The application of that for those who resolve things</a>
00:02:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h02m18s">This is that you see in the life of people their lives are tragedies</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h02m22s">In one moment, calamities meet and they are pouring out like a torrent</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h02m24s">And you can say it is no wonder that from this life he accompanied him a feeling of bitterness</a>
00:02:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h02m27s">Resentful and even aggressive</a>
00:02:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h02m30s">However, if we look to the opposite side</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h02m31s">This is also a remark Solzhenitsyn made in his book The Gulag Archipelago</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h02m34s">And in it he mentioned that he met many people, or in fact not many, but a sufficient number</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h02m37s">His conscience aroused admiration and appreciation for those in the harsh conditions of detention</a>
00:02:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h02m41s">They did not allow their bad luck and miserable lives to corrupt their souls and morals</a>
00:02:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h02m44s">This is a note worthy of our contemplation</a>
00:02:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h02m46s">Because it is possible to say that the real loss is to corrupt your soul</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h02m49s">We must carefully consider this conclusion</a>
00:02:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h02m51s">Because it is possible that any loss without losing the soul</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h02m54s">It is considered insignificant when compared to the loss of a person's soul</a>
00:02:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h02m56s">I know its hard to say</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h02m57s">Because you are likely to live in very difficult conditions</a>
00:02:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h02m59s">Yet the conclusion retains its value, which contains great wisdom in its interior</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h03m03s">And the Lord was with Joseph, and he succeeded in his works.</a>
00:03:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h03m05s">And he resided in the house of his master the Egyptian.</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h03m07s">And his masters saw that the Lord is with him and that he crowns everything that his hands have made with success.</a>
00:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h03m11s">We see here the extension of the idea that we referred to previously, which is to follow the right path of God</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h03m16s">Adam followed the path of God before the foot fell on him</a>
00:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h03m18s">He and Eve, by eating them from the forbidden tree, deviated from God's path</a>
00:03:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h03m21s">Noah adhered to the path of God and followed it, as did Abraham</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h03m25s">The idea here is to walk through your life committed to and in agreement with the world of higher values</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h03m31s">And you can look at this idea just as a metaphysical conception</a>
00:03:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h03m34s">But I don't think so, and what I mean is the realism of this perception</a>
00:03:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h03m36s">Thousands of letters I received in the past year from people who mentioned that their lives were at rock bottom</a>
00:03:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h03m44s">Exactly this life that they were leading</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h03m48s">And they decided to pull themselves out of the rock and pick up their lives</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h03m53s">The result is that their decisions bore fruit, and these are great practical experiences</a>
00:03:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h03m57s">They wrote to me the results of their decisions, and one of them decides and says, binding himself</a>
00:03:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h04m01s">I will start doing my best in my work and stop lying unless I have to and I slip my foot</a>
00:04:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h04m05s">These are decisions I will commit myself to for months as an experiment, and the result was</a>
00:04:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h04m08s">That he rained down on good in all matters of my life</a>
00:04:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h04m10s">This means that it is possible that life will proceed according to this perception</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h04m13s">Of course, it is clear that things do not always go along with this approach</a>
00:04:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h04m16s">Because it can be uprooted, regardless of the perceptions you take</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h04m19s">I mean there is the aspect of predestination and appreciation of existence that is not governed by rules or any perceptions</a>
00:04:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h04m23s">Nor can it be completely excluded from your life equations</a>
00:04:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h04m25s">However, this does not necessarily mean the absence of a corrupt perception about life that spoils it</a>
00:04:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h04m30s">And a good visualization, to enrich and cheer her up</a>
00:04:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h04m34s">So I think one of the most important and fundamental existential questions is as follows</a>
00:04:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h04m37s">Let your situation and your life is not going well</a>
00:04:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h04m40s">The fundamental question is, are you sure that you are doing everything in your power to make your life work as it should?</a>
00:04:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h04m45s">If your answer is no, then you have no right to complain about what you are about</a>
00:04:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxeRHhCTSUw#t=00h04m47s">You do not know, perhaps, by your shortcomings, or even the cause of the suffering you are enduring in your life</a>
00:04:47</p>
