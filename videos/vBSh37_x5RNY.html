<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=00h01m48s">Because modern experimental psychologists are convinced that the brain is a cognitive device,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=00h02m24s">I think it is the most fundamental achievement of psychoanalysis, in the footsteps of Nietzsche,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=00h02m32s">to think of the human mind, the psyche, as a collection of relatively integrated sub-personalities.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=00h02m47s">which is roughly the Freudian ego. They tend to see themselves as a unit.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=00h37m33s">That means you are open to reprogramming.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=00h37m47s">and all those things put her in such a state, what maybe</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=00h37m52s">is a state in which you are particularly sensitive to learning. Because when something traumatic is going on</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=00h37m57s">you should learn from that, what the world is like at that moment.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=00h38m01s">And she developed a permanent paranoia for institutions through that trauma</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=00h38m31s">You can see how under such circumstances a traumatic memory can become the core</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h03m26s">Freud was also a pioneer in that area.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h03m28s">Freud thought dreams were wish fulfillment.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h03m35s">He thought the function of dreams as wish fulfillment was to protect sleep.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h03m40s">For example, maybe you are very thirsty, you go to sleep, and you dream about drinking water.</a>
01:03:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h03m47s">Those of you who drank too much beer the night before may be familiar with such dreams.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h03m54s">So you dream that you are looking for and drinking fountains.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h03m58s">And Freud's interpretation of that was: you must stay asleep, and therefore the dream provides</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h04m08s">your underlying "id-related" motivation system, such as that which controls thirst, of the fulfillment of its desire.</a>
01:04:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h04m17s">But I think that's wrong. Though it is strange,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h04m21s">because dreams could do different things. But what seems to be happening instead ...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h04m26s">I especially realized this when I heard about an investigation into the effects</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h04m33s">of testosterone, the cycle of testosterone, on female sexual activity.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h04m37s">So it goes like this. In women the testosterone level varies during the monthly cycle,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h04m44s">and also their desire for sex. What seems to happen when the testosterone increases is not that</a>
01:04:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h04m52s">the frequency of sexual acts necessarily increases, but the frequency of sexual fantasies increases.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h04m59s">So the hormone drives the fantasies, and the fantasies drive the behavior, something like that.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h05m05s">So the dream does not fulfill a wish, what happened ...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h05m10s">that's how the motivation system manifests itself as an action plan.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h06m41s">Women like fiction more than men, because women</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h06m54s">if that gives you an aesthetic experience, if you find music compelling,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h09m24s">What I usually do is people tell me their dream from the beginning to the end.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h09m30s">Freud would say you introduce all kinds of assumptions right away, because they don't tell you the dream,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h09m44s">I tell people, "Write it down as soon as you can, without thinking too much about it."</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h09m48s">Because we don't want any subsequent edits. Then I listen to it and they tell it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h09m59s">and then I see what that reminds me of, and then I ask the person</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h10m04s">what it reminds him of. And then we talk about that. Those are the direct associations,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h10m09s">the things Freud would call free associations. And you can say that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h10m13s">around every utterance, such as a sentence, there is a collection of potential meanings.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h10m19s">These can be direct meanings, strongly related to it,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h10m24s">and loose meanings. The client and therapist can continue to exchange thoughts</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h10m30s">until you think, "Okay, it seems to be heading that way." And you can see it too</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h10m34s">in relation to the person's actual experiences, and the rest of the dream,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h10m39s">and maybe all the dreams he's told you before. So it is extremely complex.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h10m48s">your interpretation of a conversation is correct? There are several ways</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h10m55s">to approach that, but you're not sure. There are many different ways</a>
01:10:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h11m00s">to interpret a conversation. That's why the Postmodernists in one</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h11m05s">black hole with regard to literature. They realized there is no limit to the amount of manners</a>
01:11:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h11m09s">to interpret a book. But then they took it a step further:</a>
01:11:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h11m14s">"Therefore it has no meaning." No, incorrect. That's a simplistic way of thinking.</a>
01:11:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h11m22s">It means that the way the book conveys meaning is very complex,</a>
01:11:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h11m27s">you cannot describe it on the basis of normal, linear rationality. That is not to say that there is no meaning.</a>
01:11:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h11m32s">That is so sad. It's such a sad theory. And it's dangerous too</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h11m37s">for it means that nothing has meaning, and that is the most dangerous theory.</a>
01:11:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h11m42s">Either way, you talk to the person about the dream and the dream image, and about</a>
01:11:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h11m47s">what that evokes memories. And you also pay attention to what they say because sometimes ...</a>
01:11:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h11m54s">For example, this happened recently, someone is describing a dream</a>
01:11:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h11m58s">where he's walking around, and he says, "I'm on the wrong road."</a>
01:11:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h12m02s">And you think, "Okay." Now we know what your dream means because</a>
01:12:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h12m06s">you just said it. "I'm on the wrong track." That's a Freudian slip of the tongue.</a>
01:12:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h12m12s">That's interesting because when you listen to how people tell their dreams, you have to listen to ...</a>
01:12:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h12m16s">it is as if they have two spirits speaking at the same time. One describes the dream,</a>
01:12:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h12m21s">but the other describes his life, and they don't see the connection.</a>
01:12:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h12m25s">And you point it out, and they say, "Oh, yeah, I didn't realize I was saying that."</a>
01:12:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h12m29s">That's a Freudian slip of the tongue. What's happening is ... the right hemisphere of the brain</a>
01:12:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h12m33s">is a system that collects images, a type of system that collects low-resolution patterns,</a>
01:12:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h12m40s">that mainly uses images and tries to create meaningful coherence,</a>
01:12:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h12m45s">but that meaning is vague and comprehensive. And the left hemisphere</a>
01:12:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h12m51s">the linguistic hemisphere tries to make clear what that means, but in words.</a>
01:12:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h12m56s">It's very difficult to make that transition, but that's why dream analysis works in part.</a>
01:12:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h13m01s">Because you allow the information to move from images</a>
01:13:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h13m06s">to the articulated part of the personality. You move information up the hierarchy of abstraction,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h13m12s">to the point where it can be used. I will conclude this discussion of Freud</a>
01:13:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h13m18s">with a description of research that has been carried out recently,</a>
01:13:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h13m25s">relatively recently, for the past twenty years, by a psychologist at the University of Texas,</a>
01:13:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h13m31s">in Austin, called James Pennebaker. And Pennebaker is a very smart psychologist.</a>
01:13:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h13m38s">Freud had another idea related to therapy. He thought</a>
01:13:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h13m43s">that if you were undergoing therapy and talked about a traumatic event,</a>
01:13:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h13m46s">that you were then healed by "catharsis." That meant the trauma was linked to a collection of feelings,</a>
01:13:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h13m53s">who were oppressed, but who tried to rise from the depths,</a>
01:13:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h13m57s">and caused all kinds of stress and misery, because you tried to stop them. And if you</a>
01:13:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h14m01s">talking to someone about it and expressing your feelings would help you.</a>
01:14:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h14m07s">Expressing your feelings doesn't help, by the way. That turns out to be wrong, but</a>
01:14:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h14m13s">it is wrong in an interesting and useful way. Because it is almost right.</a>
01:14:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h14m17s">Pennebaker dropped "undergraduates" for three consecutive days</a>
01:14:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h14m24s">came to the study and had them write for 15 minutes every day,</a>
01:14:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h14m29s">about the worst thing they had ever done or experienced.</a>
01:14:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h14m32s">Often people are traumatized by something they've done, not something they've been through.</a>
01:14:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h14m37s">More often, because someone sees themselves doing something terrible,</a>
01:14:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h14m42s">and thinks, "My God, I did! Who am I?" They have no idea</a>
01:14:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h14m47s">and then things start to collapse. Anyway, Pennebaker let them do that,</a>
01:14:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h14m53s">and for the next two weeks they were pretty miserable. That is interesting,</a>
01:14:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h14m56s">because if they only measured the result of that intervention in those two weeks,</a>
01:14:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h15m01s">everyone would have said, "Never write down your traumatic experiences,</a>
01:15:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h15m05s">because that makes it worse. ”But in the six months after that, what happened in particular,</a>
01:15:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h15m11s">was that their physical health improved. They went to the doctor less, they were</a>
01:15:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h15m15s">less often sick, et cetera. That was because their general stress level decreased,</a>
01:15:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h15m19s">for complex reasons that we can talk about later. And Pennebaker, a good scientist, thought:</a>
01:15:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h15m24s">"Okay, catharsis works." You are venting your trauma, and "poof!" it is solved.</a>
01:15:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h15m29s">But then he thought, "Wait a minute, maybe it's important how you express it."</a>
01:15:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h15m35s">So he went back and counted all the words that had to do with emotion,</a>
01:15:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h15m39s">and all words related to understanding and cognition. And he discovered two things:</a>
01:15:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h15m44s">the more words you used, as your story developed,</a>
01:15:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h15m50s">that indicated insight and understanding, the better you were, in the long run.</a>
01:15:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h15m55s">It's not about expressing your feelings, it's about expressing</a>
01:15:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h16m01s">your feelings and the weaving of the memory into a new coherent representation,</a>
01:16:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h16m09s">from which you derive a moral. So what's the moral of trauma? "Don't let it happen again!"</a>
01:16:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h16m15s">That is the message. And the threat systems will keep bugging you with that,</a>
01:16:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h16m20s">until you fix it. "How did I get into it? How do I keep it from happening in the future?"</a>
01:16:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h16m25s">That doesn't mean it's your fault, but your fear systems aren't interested in that.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h16m29s">They want to prevent you from falling into the same hole.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h16m34s">And the only way to do that is analyze the causal relationships that brought you to that hole,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h16m37s">and see if you can change your behavior and attitude,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh37_x5RNY#t=01h16m42s">so that it no longer happens, or avoid such situations. One of the two.</a>
