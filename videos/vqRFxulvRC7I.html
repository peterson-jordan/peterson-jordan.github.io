					<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h00m00s">Okay, so today we're going to talk about openness.</a>
00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h00m07s">Now, you might say in some sense that openness
is the last discovered of the big five traits,</a>
00:00:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h00m16s">and it's also the one that comes up most weakly
in the factor analysis.</a>
00:00:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h00m23s">When Hans Eysenck formulated his trait representation
which was extraversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism,</a>
00:00:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h00m31s">he felt that he encapsulated all of the fundamental
variation in human personality and he was</a>
00:00:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h00m42s">loathe to include intelligence as a personality
trait.</a>
00:00:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h00m46s">Now, the relationship between psychoticism
and openness is rather complex.</a>
00:00:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h00m54s">Eysenck basically felt that people could be
extraverted and that would be the positive</a>
00:00:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h00m58s">dimension, and could be high in negative emotion
and that would be the negative emotion dimension,</a>
00:00:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h01m02s">and that they could also have a predisposition
to psychosis.</a>
00:01:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h01m08s">He was thinking about the brain systems that
underlie schizophrenia and that tendency to</a>
00:01:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h01m16s">dissociate and develop hallucinations, but
also maybe the systems in human beings that</a>
00:01:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h01m23s">are affected by hallucinogenic drugs, which
seem to affect human beings differently than</a>
00:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h01m29s">they affect other creatures.</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h01m31s">Eysenck's psychoticism eventually was broken
down into low agreeableness and low conscientiousness--it</a>
00:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h01m39s">didn't predict the predisposition to psychosis
at all.</a>
00:01:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h01m43s">And later factor analysis found that you could
load out intelligence and creativity as a</a>
00:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h01m50s">personality dimension separately.</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h01m52s">Now, it's a bit tricky because you have IQ
measures and IQ measures are much more direct</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h01m59s">measures of intelligence then the personality
measures.</a>
00:01:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h02m01s">I mean the personality measure is something
like: do you think you're smart?</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h02m05s">You know, I'm being a bit flippant about that
because it's more sophisticated than that,</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h02m12s">but when you talk about someone as a smart
person, you're generally referring to the</a>
00:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h02m17s">trait that we would describe as openness.</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h02m19s">You also are doing that when you refer to
creativity as a predisposition.</a>
00:02:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h02m26s">And you can measure the smart part a lot better
with IQ, and IQ is also a pretty good predictor</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h02m32s">of creativity.</a>
00:02:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h02m34s">Well, so let's see how they're associated.</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h02m38s">You remember that you have your big two traits--stability
and plasticity--and stability breaks down</a>
00:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h02m46s">into conscientiousness, emotional stability,
and agreeableness.</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h02m49s">And then you can see how each of the aspects
are correlated--how highly they're correlated.</a>
00:02:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h02m55s">So industriousness and orderliness at about
.4, volatility and withdrawal in emotional</a>
00:02:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h03m00s">stability--or neuroticism actually--about
.6, and agreeableness and politeness at about</a>
00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h03m07s">.4.</a>
00:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h03m08s">And then the next trait is extraversion and
openness--that makes plasticity--and people</a>
00:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h03m16s">who are high in plasticity tend to be good
entrepreneurs, by the way.</a>
00:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h03m21s">And extraversion breaks into assertiveness
and enthusiasm, correlated at about .5, and</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h03m29s">then openness and intelligence--the correlation
there is lower--it's .35.</a>
00:03:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h03m34s">The average correlation between the big 5
is .2, and the correlation between the big</a>
00:03:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h03m38s">two is about .2.</a>
00:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h03m39s">And so you have to remember, you might ask
yourself, well is a correlation of .4 twice</a>
00:03:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h03m47s">as large as a correlation of .2?</a>
00:03:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h03m49s">And the answer to that is no, because you
have to square them to compare them arithmetically.</a>
00:03:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h03m54s">So a correlation of .2 gives you .04, 4% squared,
and a correlation of .4 gives you 16% squared,</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h04m04s">so there's actually a difference of a factor
of 4.</a>
00:04:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h04m07s">And so you need to remember that when you're
considering effect sizes so that you can understand</a>
00:04:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h04m14s">exactly what they mean.</a>
00:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h04m15s">Now, if you're accounting for 16% of the variance
which would be a correlation of .4, then that</a>
00:04:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h04m21s">leaves 84% left unexplained.</a>
00:04:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h04m24s">But that's a bit of an overstatement most
of the time in psychology because our measures</a>
00:04:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h04m30s">are rather imperfect and so, for example,
if you give someone a personality test and</a>
00:04:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h04m39s">let's say that the validity of their self
report is about .6 or .7, which is probably</a>
00:04:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h04m45s">what it is--maybe it might be a little bit
higher than that--that means that their self-report</a>
00:04:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h04m51s">is only picking up 50% of the variation in
their personality.</a>
00:04:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h04m56s">And if an R derived from that measure accounts
for 16% of the variance, in some sense it's</a>
00:04:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h05m05s">twice as powerful as it appears to be.</a>
00:05:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h05m07s">Because the measure is so error-ridden.</a>
00:05:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h05m09s">And a lot of the things that we measure in
psychology are error-ridden, and what that</a>
00:05:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h05m13s">means is that the correlations--generally
what it means, although not invariably--is</a>
00:05:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h05m18s">that the correlations are bigger than they
look.</a>
00:05:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h05m20s">In any case, the correlations that come up
in personality research are certainly big</a>
00:05:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h05m25s">enough to be meaningful, and I would say meaningful
in terms of predicting major life outcomes</a>
00:05:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h05m32s">and predicting important economic outcomes
and that sort of thing.</a>
00:05:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h05m41s">One of the things you might ask yourself is,
exactly what does intelligence measure?</a>
00:05:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h05m46s">So we'll start with intelligence, and that
would be equivalent to intellect roughly speaking.</a>
00:05:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h05m51s">So intellect in the big 5, the aspect seems
to be associated with interest in ideas.</a>
00:05:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h05m58s">Whereas the openness proper aspect seems to
be associated with aesthetic sensibility and</a>
00:05:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h06m05s">creativity.</a>
00:06:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h06m06s">That's the best way to think about it, as
far as we've been able to figure out.</a>
00:06:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h06m10s">And the biggest relationship is between intellect
and intelligence, as measured psychometrically.</a>
00:06:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h06m17s">Now, intelligence is an interesting concept.</a>
00:06:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h06m19s">It's very controversial.</a>
00:06:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h06m22s">In fact, one of the things that continually
happens over and over again in psychology</a>
00:06:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h06m29s">is that psychologists discover all sorts of
new kinds of intelligence, and the biggest</a>
00:06:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h06m35s">two proponents of that sort of thing I suppose
were Bob Sternberg, who came up with this</a>
00:06:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h06m39s">thing he called practical intelligence, and
then Howard Gardner, who came up with the</a>
00:06:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h06m43s">theory of multiple intelligences, which had
a very large effect on educational psychology</a>
00:06:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h06m48s">when the theory was first proposed.</a>
00:06:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h06m52s">And that's not saying much because, generally
speaking, it's very difficult to find a discipline</a>
00:06:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h06m57s">that's more susceptible to fads than educational
psychology.</a>
00:06:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h07m01s">As far as I can tell, generally speaking,
each fad is worse than the previous one.</a>
00:07:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h07m06s">So, Gardner posited that, I think there were
7 or 8 different intelligences: linguistic,</a>
00:07:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h07m15s">musical, logical, mathematical, spatial, body/kinaesthetic,
intrapersonal, and interpersonal.</a>
00:07:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h07m23s">And people talk about emotional intelligence
and they talk about practical intelligence.</a>
00:07:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h07m28s">As far as I'm concerned, all of that's complete
rubbish.</a>
00:07:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h07m31s">And there's technical reasons for that.</a>
00:07:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h07m33s">I mean, there's technical and philosophical
reasons for that.</a>
00:07:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h07m37s">The first thing is, you can't just mess up
a word.</a>
00:07:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h07m40s">You know, the whole point of having a word
is so that it defines some things, it describes</a>
00:07:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h07m44s">some things, and doesn't describe other things,
right.</a>
00:07:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h07m47s">And so you can make the word intelligence
account for whatever you want.</a>
00:07:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h07m53s">And so you can say that the ability to dance
is a form of intelligence.</a>
00:07:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h07m59s">But the problem with that is you blur out
the word so badly, you can't tell what it</a>
00:07:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h08m02s">means anymore.</a>
00:08:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h08m04s">And so I would also point out: we had perfectly
good words for those major intelligences.</a>
00:08:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h08m08s">We called them talents.</a>
00:08:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h08m10s">And so it's perfectly reasonable to make a
distinction between a talent and intelligence.</a>
00:08:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h08m15s">Now you might say, well how the hell do you
know the difference?</a>
00:08:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h08m19s">If things look similar to some degree, then
how do you know if they're the same or different?</a>
00:08:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h08m24s">Well that's exactly what you do when you do
the construct validity process.</a>
00:08:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h08m28s">So let's say you rated a number of people
on their dancing ability.</a>
00:08:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h08m33s">And then you rated a number of people on their
ability to multiply two two-digit numbers</a>
00:08:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h08m39s">in their head quickly.</a>
00:08:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h08m40s">Well then, you see technically, if both of
those were intelligences, then the people</a>
00:08:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h08m47s">who could dance better could multiply two-digit
numbers faster in their head.</a>
00:08:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h08m52s">They would be slightly positively-- <em>coughs</em>
--see that's what happens when I don't have</a>
00:08:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h09m02s">any diet coke.</a>
00:09:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h09m04s">So anyways, if intelligence was the right
word to subsume both of those, then what you'd</a>
00:09:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h09m11s">see is there'd be a high correlation.</a>
00:09:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h09m13s">The people who were good dancers would also
be the ones who could multiply most rapidly--I</a>
00:09:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h09m17s">mean multiply in their head.</a>
00:09:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h09m24s">But you're not going to be able to extract
out a single factor like that.</a>
00:09:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h09m29s">It's just not the case that those things associate
like that.</a>
00:09:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h09m33s">So for something to be one phenomena, the
things that it-- <em>coughs</em> -- obviously I've</a>
00:09:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h09m46s">talked too much this semester.</a>
00:09:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h09m50s">All the things that are subsumed under that
definition have to be correlated.</a>
00:09:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h09m56s">And highly correlated.</a>
00:09:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h09m57s">Because otherwise they're not the same thing.</a>
00:09:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h09m59s">It's the definition of the same thing.</a>
00:09:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h10m02s">Now IQ is a very peculiar construct, a very
unique construct from a psychological perspective.</a>
00:10:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h10m11s">But also, more generally, from a social science
perspective because IQ has the most predictive</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h10m23s">Now the other thing that is interesting about
IQ is that a lot of the people who were interested</a>
00:10:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h10m31s">early in the measure of intelligence were
engineers turned psychologists.</a>
00:10:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h10m37s">And the engineers have actually had quite
a whopping effect on psychology.</a>
00:10:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h10m41s">Part of the reason that psychology has an
advanced methodology and advances statistical</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h10m46s">techniques is because we got invaded by engineers
in the early part of the 20th century, and</a>
00:10:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h10m51s">so the engineers made our measurements much
more rigorous than they would have otherwise</a>
00:10:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h10m55s">been and it's been a huge advantage.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h10m57s">I mean, one of the things that's happening
to psychology is that it's starting to eat</a>

it's going to have a massive effect on political</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h11m09s">And the reason for that is because we know
how to measure things, and it actually turns</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h11m13s">Obviously, I mean if you're going to be talking
about something that's specific and well-defined,</a>
00:11:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h11m19s">first of all, if you can't make it specific
and well-defined, all you can really do is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h11m24s">argue about it.</a>

but the problem is that just because an argument</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h11m37s">It's also something to remember when you're
arguing about people that you have a relationship</a>

abstraction and mental operations: that's</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h13m11s">So you might say, exactly what constitutes
an abstraction?</a>
00:13:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h13m16s">And it looks to me like what an abstraction
is--there's the capacity to formulate an abstraction</a>
00:13:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h13m21s">and there's the capacity to manipulate them.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h13m23s">To formulate an abstraction, I think what
you do is you take a phenomena and you represent</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h13m28s">it with something that's low resolution.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h13m31s">That's more or less what an abstraction is.</a>
00:13:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h13m32s">So, for example, if I imagine this classroom
later, my imagined representation is going</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h13m42s">to be of much lower resolution than the actual
classroom, but it's sufficient for certain</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h14m09s">and the ability to manipulate those seems
to be the core element of intelligence.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h14m14s">And I think part of the reason why intelligence,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h14m21s">obviously you can to some degree rank order
animals in terms of their capacity to learn,</a>
00:14:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h14m28s">but there's this whopping differentiation
between human beings and animals in this area</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h14m33s">particularly--is because we can use abstractions.</a>
00:14:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h14m36s">Now, I heard a woman named Temple Grandin
speak once and it was a very interesting talk.</a>
00:14:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h14m42s">She's very autistic, but very brilliant, which
is not very common for people who are autistic</a>
00:14:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h14m51s">because usually it's associated with a substantial
amount of intellectual impairment.</a>
00:14:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h14m54s">But she also had an extraordinarily devoted
parent who spent almost all her time trying</a>
00:14:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h15m01s">to pull her daughter out of her autistic isolation.</a>
00:15:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h15m04s">Now Grandin has gone on to become a University
of Chicago professor--and she works in the</a>
00:15:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h15m11s">agricultural area--and she has redesigned
the chutes, the walkways basically, that take</a>

00:15:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h15m19s">And she's done that to make them much less
stressful for the animals.</a>
00:15:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h15m24s">And part of the reason she can do that, as
far as she's concerned, is because she thinks</a>
00:15:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h15m27s">like an animal.</a>
00:15:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h15m29s">And what that means, as far as she can tell,
is that she cannot generate an abstraction--not</a>
00:15:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h15m34s">easily.</a>
00:15:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h15m35s">Now she can speak so obviously she learned
to do it to some degree, but she talked more</a>
00:15:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h15m40s">about deficits in imagination or concretization
of imagination.</a>
00:15:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h15m44s">So one of the weird things that you see with
autistic kids, not frequently but now and</a>
00:15:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h15m49s">then--there's actually a famous example of
this on the web.</a>
00:15:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h15m52s">There's a guy, I think he's from Britain,
and you can take him in a helicopter and fly</a>
00:15:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h15m56s">him over a city, and then he can stand in
front of a piece of paper, like 12x8, start</a>
00:15:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h16m02s">anywhere, and draw the entire city.</a>
00:16:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h16m06s">Now and then you see autistic savants who
are children who can draw perfectly realistically,</a>
00:16:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h16m11s">and so maybe they'll draw a horse and they
don't even start the horse like a kid would--like</a>
00:16:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h16m16s">a normal kid would sketch the outline of the
horse and put some eyes in.</a>
00:16:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h16m20s">They put some eyes in and make the horse perfectly
detailed.</a>
00:16:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h16m26s">And what Grandin claimed was that-- she said
okay, you think of "house" or think of "church".</a>
00:16:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h16m34s">And she says, what comes to mind if you think
of church?</a>
00:16:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h16m37s">And maybe she'd say, well you get this little
image of something that's sort of shaped like</a>
00:16:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h16m41s">this with a steeped on top or a cross or something
like that, and that's a church.</a>
00:16:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h16m46s">And so maybe you think of house and it's like
a little kid's house.</a>
00:16:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h16m49s">It's got a rectangle and a parallelogram--that's
not a parallelogram, whatever the hell you</a>
00:16:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h16m54s">call that thing on the top--and then it's
got a chimney with smoke coming out of it,</a>
00:16:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h16m58s">right.</a>
00:16:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h16m59s">Two windows and a door.</a>
00:16:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h17m00s">House.</a>
00:17:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h17m01s">Yeah, but there are no houses like that.</a>
00:17:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h17m03s">Each individual house looks a lot different
than that.</a>
00:17:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h17m07s">And so in order to have that conception of
house, essentially what you have to do is</a>
00:17:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h17m10s">you have to take that class of all possible
houses and extract out the features that are</a>
00:17:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h17m16s">common across all of them.</a>
00:17:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h17m18s">And that's an abstraction.</a>
00:17:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h17m20s">And so, as far as Grandin's concerned, she
doesn't have abstractions like that.</a>
00:17:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h17m24s">When you ask her to think of "church", she
remembers "a church".</a>
00:17:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h17m28s">It's always singular instances.</a>
00:17:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h17m31s">Now the thing about human beings is that we
perceive singular instances to some degree,</a>
00:17:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h17m38s">although I think our abstraction capacity
often interferes with our ability to do that.</a>
00:17:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h17m43s">But we also perceive abstractions.</a>
00:17:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h17m45s">And you can kind of tell this if you're ever
trying to learn to draw.</a>
00:17:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h17m49s">Like if I say, draw a hand.</a>
00:17:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h17m51s">You guys, most of you unless you have artistic
training, you're going to draw what's essentially</a>
00:17:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h17m56s">a hieroglyphic hand.</a>
00:17:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h17m57s">I think the drawings that children come up
with aren't drawings; I think they're hieroglyphs.</a>
00:17:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h18m02s">They're abstracted representations that are
quasi-linguistic.</a>
00:18:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h18m06s">They're not artwork, they're proto-language.</a>
00:18:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h18m09s">And hieroglyphs of course were one of the
earliest forms of written language.</a>
00:18:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h18m13s">It makes sense, because if you want to communicate
about something, why not draw an image.</a>
00:18:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h18m17s">And eventually the image turns into a word.</a>
00:18:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h18m19s">But I actually think that's the developmental
progression of language among human beings.</a>
00:18:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h18m24s">It's the abstracted image first and then it's
the word.</a>
00:18:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h18m28s">Anyways, if you drew a hand, you'd likely
draw a hieroglyphic hand: 5 fingers or maybe</a>
00:18:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h18m34s">even 4, right, because that's what animators
do.</a>
00:18:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h18m37s">You can't fit all those sausages on one circle.</a>
00:18:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h18m41s">So they just simplify it down to 4 and no
one even cares.</a>
00:18:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h18m44s">You watch an animated program, which is highly
abstracted--I mean Homer Simpson looks nothing</a>
00:18:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h18m50s">like an actual person.</a>
00:18:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h18m51s">Like really tremendously unlike an actual
person, and it's completely irrelevant.</a>
00:18:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h18m57s">After two or three seconds it doesn't matter
at all.</a>
00:18:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h19m00s">Which is also why I think 3D movies--it's
never a technology that's ever caught on.</a>
00:19:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h19m05s">Because after the first 4 seconds, who the
hell cares.</a>
00:19:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h19m07s">It's irrelevant whether you see in three dimensions
because you don't need much information to</a>
00:19:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h19m12s">actually structure your perception.</a>
00:19:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h19m14s">Now if you want to see your hand--weirdly
enough--so that you can draw it, you have</a>
00:19:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h19m18s">to snap out of your normal mode of perception.</a>
00:19:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h19m21s">I find often it's a lot easier to do that
with one eye closed because it flattens it</a>
00:19:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h19m25s">out.</a>
00:19:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h19m26s">And then you have to stop looking at your
hand as if it's a hand.</a>
00:19:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h19m29s">You have to look at it again like it's an
object.</a>
00:19:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h19m31s">And as soon as you do that it's actually rather
shocking because it's such a strange looking</a>
00:19:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h19m35s">thing.</a>
00:19:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h19m36s">If you put your hand in a non-canonical position
<em>gestures</em> --that's a canonical position,</a>
00:19:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h19m40s">I would say--if you put your hand in a non-canonical
position and then look at it, it's the weirdest</a>
00:19:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h19m45s">shaped thing.</a>
00:19:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h19m46s">It's quite shocking to see it, you know.</a>
00:19:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h19m48s">And then you can draw it--once you can actually
see it like that--but before that, you're</a>
00:19:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h19m52s">pretty much stuck in "hand".</a>
00:19:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h19m55s">So anyways, I think what happens with intelligence
is that people are capable of abstracting</a>
00:19:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h20m01s">and then they can manipulate abstractions.</a>
00:20:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h20m03s">And so let's take another look at what abstractions
might be.</a>
00:20:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h20m09s">Now part of the reason that I think abstraction
is so useful is because things are really</a>
00:20:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h20m13s">really complicated and it's going to be a
lot more difficult to manipulate the actual</a>
00:20:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h20m18s">thing than to manipulate some representative
abstraction of it.</a>
00:20:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h20m22s">So if you could get an abstraction that captures
the gist of the entity--now how we do that</a>
00:20:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h20m28s">is not exactly obvious--but if you can, then
you can expend a lot more resources concentrating</a>
00:20:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h20m33s">on the relevant parts of the entity and a
lot less time concentrating on the irrelevant</a>
00:20:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h20m39s">parts.</a>
00:20:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h20m40s">So for example if you ask a child to draw
a house, what colour the house is is irrelevant.</a>
00:20:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h20m46s">Now why it's irrelevant is not exactly obvious.</a>
00:20:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h20m49s">I guess it's because colour can vary across
houses.</a>
00:20:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h20m52s">And colour varies across all sorts of other
things, and so colour turns out to be a non-canonical</a>
00:20:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h20m57s">element of "house" and so you can just dispense
with it when you're thinking about a house.</a>
00:20:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h21m01s">You'd say, well it doesn't matter what colour
the house is--it's still a house.</a>
00:21:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h21m05s">So what exactly defines those features that
make something a house rather than something</a>
00:21:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h21m10s">else are not that easy to figure out.</a>
00:21:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h21m13s">You could say, well, a house has four walls
and a roof.</a>
00:21:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h21m17s">And those are the external walls and I guess
you could identify the minimal necessary components,</a>
00:21:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h21m22s">but even that's not so simple.</a>
00:21:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h21m25s">And you could say a house is also something
that someone lives in, which allows you to</a>
00:21:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h21m30s">put caves as houses because caves obviously
share very little in common with the standard</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h21m36s">house.</a>
00:21:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h21m37s">My point is that it's difficult exactly to
figure out what set of features we do use</a>
00:21:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h21m42s">to determine whether something is a member
of a class.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h21m46s">There's this guy named Gigerenzer who’s
thought about this a lot, and he thinks that</a>

basically.</a>
00:21:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h21m55s">And that enables us to do things like come
up with a category of "things you would take</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h22m03s">Which is a really interesting category because
most of the things that you're going to take</a>

see why they make a category.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h22m32s">Well you get the point is that those things
that I just mentioned seem to share very little</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h22m38s">in terms of objective features in common,
but there's some reason that they still cohere</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h22m42s">as a category.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h22m43s">Alright, so why do you need to abstract?</a>
00:22:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h22m45s">Well, because you can handle the complexity
of the world better.</a>
00:22:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h22m48s">Even your perception is a form of abstraction,
you know, because when you look at someone,</a>
00:22:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h22m53s">a lot of the abstraction is done for you because
you just can't perceive very well, but when</a>
00:22:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h22m57s">you look at someone--first of all, you only
see the surface of them that's facing you</a>
00:22:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h23m02s">and not the other surface, so that's a big
limitation.</a>
00:23:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h23m04s">You only see them now in this split second,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h23m10s">You don't see any of their microstructure
beyond the general pattern of the physiology</a>
00:23:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h23m18s">at this level of resolution.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h23m20s">You don't see anything beyond that.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h23m21s">I can't see your cells or your organs or anything
like that, which is actually a real problem</a>
00:23:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h23m25s">often for us.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h23m29s">So right off the bat, just to perceive gives
you a low resolution representation, and a</a>
00:23:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h23m35s">lot of that is limitations of your processing.</a>
00:23:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h23m37s">Your eyes just can't zoom in that far.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h23m42s">Plus, how much do you really want to see at
one time?</a>
00:23:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h23m45s">No more than necessary, whatever that means.</a>
00:23:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h23m47s">And evolution seems to take care of that problem.</a>
00:23:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h23m50s">So your perception abstracts for you right
away, but then I would say maybe you make</a>
00:23:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h23m55s">a leap from perception to conception, something
like that.</a>
00:23:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h23m59s">And so that would be the leap from the perception
of the actual object to the image of the object,</a>
00:23:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h24m04s">and then a leap from the image of the object
to the word.</a>
00:24:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h24m07s">So it looks to me that a word is a representation
of an image which is a representation of an</a>
00:24:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h24m13s">object or a situation--it's something like
that.</a>
00:24:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h24m18s">And you need those because you have to deal
with a complex world.</a>
00:24:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h24m21s">So here's one way of thinking about it.</a>
00:24:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h24m23s">Look at the top left corner of that diagram.</a>
00:24:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h24m25s">I call that the thing in itself, and what
it is is an array of dots, roughly speaking,</a>
00:24:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h24m33s">and--I think there's 350 dots there--and you
might say, well--and then if it was a real</a>
00:24:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h24m38s">world object you could imagine that would
be in three dimensions, not two, because that's</a>
00:24:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h24m43s">two, and it would be transformed because it
would be also extended across time.</a>
00:24:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h24m48s">And it would have microstructures that were
far smaller than that and macrostructures</a>
00:24:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h24m52s">that were far bigger, so even that is an abstraction,
but I'm using a fairly complex abstraction</a>
00:24:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h25m00s">to represent the thing in itself.</a>
00:25:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h25m02s">That's the thing you cannot perceive, right.</a>
00:25:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h25m05s">What something actually is.</a>
00:25:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h25m06s">You just get an image.</a>
00:25:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h25m07s">And then the next five things are ways you
could look at that.</a>
00:25:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h25m11s">So you could say, well, it's a rectangle.</a>
00:25:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h25m13s">You could say it's four rectangles, and forget
about the dots.</a>
00:25:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h25m17s">You could say that it's--I think that's 16
lines or, what is it, 32 lines?</a>
00:25:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h25m23s">24 lines.</a>
00:25:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h25m25s">So if that thing in itself was an orchard
and you were going to walk south to north</a>
00:25:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h25m31s">through it, that would be a good representation.</a>
00:25:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h25m34s">Those would be corridors, roughly speaking,
and then object four is a combination of object</a>
00:25:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h25m39s">one and object two.</a>
00:25:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h25m41s">And then object five is, well, all that's
blurred out are the little groups of six dots.</a>
00:25:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h25m47s">And so you might say, well, what is that thing?</a>
00:25:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h25m50s">And then the answer is, well it's any of those
five things.</a>
00:25:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h25m53s">And so that's an interesting way of thinking
about it too because one of the things it</a>
00:25:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h25m56s">shows you is that you can disagree about what
something is right at the level of perception.</a>
00:25:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h26m01s">And then you might say well which of those
is the best representation?</a>
00:26:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h26m05s">And the first answer might be, well, the most
complex one: the one in the left-hand corner.</a>
00:26:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h26m10s">But that's not necessarily the case--it might
depend on what you want the representation</a>
00:26:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h26m15s">for.</a>
00:26:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h26m16s">Like imagine--it's weird, it's weird--because
imagine you have a map, okay.</a>
00:26:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h26m21s">And so you think, well I'm going to make the
best map in the world, and so you make a map</a>
00:26:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h26m25s">that's exactly the same size as the territory
that it represents and has all the detail.</a>
00:26:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h26m31s">Well that's not any use at all, that thing,
because you could just use the territory,</a>
00:26:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h26m37s">right?</a>
00:26:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h26m38s">Just because, as a map gets increasingly detailed,
to some degree, it's increasingly useless</a>
00:26:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h26m45s">as a map.</a>
00:26:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h26m46s">And so what you need is this weird combination
between accuracy and simplicity.</a>
00:26:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h26m51s">And so you want your map to be no more complicated
than is necessary than to take you from point</a>
00:26:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h26m56s">A to point B, that's it.</a>
00:26:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h27m00s">Because otherwise, it wouldn't be simple to
use and the additional complexity would limit</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h29m32s">I designed an IQ test a while back and we

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h29m51s">you're more intelligent in this example, if

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h29m57s">We could get a pretty reliable IQ test with
nine items, but it was substantially improved</a>

00:30:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h30m10s">So a hundred is plenty.</a>
00:30:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h30m11s">Okay, so you pull out a hundred questions
and then you take 100 people and you gave</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h30m17s">them those questions, and then you score them--right

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h30m24s">Okay, so basically, the sum behaves like the
average--let's say you average the scores</a>
00:30:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h30m30s">just to make the argument a little bit more

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h30m33s">You average the scores, and so each of you
gets the average calculated across the times</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h30m42s">that you were right and wrong, so it's an
approximation of the frequency of how right</a>

100.</a>
00:30:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h30m53s">That's IQ.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h31m00s">Well, that's annoying, because all they're

ask if A is equivalent to B, the answer is,</a>
00:31:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h31m13s">it depends on what you mean by A and what

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h31m25s">People usually get around that by only using
a word in a context, right--in a sentence</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h31m31s">or a phrase or a paragraph that defines the

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h31m37s">But more specifically in psychology, we have
methods to tell if something is real, and</a>
00:31:37</p>

a psychological measure, then no other psychological</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h31m53s">measures pass the test because they're validated
exactly the same way IQ is, and they don't</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h32m00s">So you can say, well no, that's not real,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h32m05s">have to throw out the social sciences completely

00:36:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h36m38s">you do it more and more and you get smoother

as you get better and better at it the ability</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h36m57s">So what's happening, to some degree, is your
prefrontal cortex is programming the rest</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h37m01s">of your brain.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h37m03s">And you can think of fluid intelligence as
a measure of the ability of your brain to</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h37m10s">program itself, and crystallized ability as
a measure of how much programming is there.</a>
00:37:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h37m16s">So they're separate in that manner because
they perform separate functions, but then</a>
00:37:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h37m20s">you can also understand that the better your
programmer is, the better your programming</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h37m25s">is going to be so that inflates the correlation.</a>
00:37:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h37m28s">And so you can have to separate things functionally--that
are even dissociable in terms of age--but</a>
00:37:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h37m34s">because they work so tightly together--it's
like, how fast can you dig a hole and how</a>
00:37:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h37m40s">big is the pile of dirt?</a>
00:37:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h37m42s">Well obviously those two things are different
in some important sense, but they're going</a>
00:37:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h37m46s">to be highly correlated because the faster

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h37m50s">So anyways, crystallized intelligence is also
often measured as verbal intelligence, but</a>
00:37:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h37m57s">the better measure fundamentally is crystallized
intelligence.</a>
00:37:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h38m03s">Now, you know how we looked at the personality
hierarchy, right--that was this *gestures</a>
00:38:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h38m11s">to slide*.</a>
00:38:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h38m14s">And what you see is three strata, roughly
speaking: aspect, trait, superfactor.</a>
00:38:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h38m21s">And it looks like--the superfactors, I would
say, the validity of those superfactors is</a>
00:38:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h38m27s">not yet clear.</a>
00:38:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h38m30s">You can get a lot of useful prediction by
looking at the traits, and there's more and</a>
00:38:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h38m34s">more evidence--there's about 400 studies now
using the aspects--there's more and more evidence</a>
00:38:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h38m39s">that you can also derive additional useful
predictive validity from differentiating the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h38m46s">personality down to the aspect level.</a>
00:38:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h38m50s">So that's the highest resolution personality
level we have.</a>
00:38:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h38m55s">There are people who claim that there's something
at the apex which you might call "good personality",</a>
00:38:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h39m00s">but I don't think so.</a>

the dispute--it's a statistical dispute roughly</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h39m10s">speaking--but we've found in our research
that stability and plasticity are only correlated</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h39m27s">Okay, so</a>
00:39:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h40m06s">if you read the cognitive literature and the

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h40m24s">And they make that claim because they'll take
a test and they'll use the test to measure</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h40m29s">something, and then they'll correlate that

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h40m41s">are identical--because the correlation should
be more like 0.8 for them to be identical.</a>
00:40:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h40m46s">But the problem is, let's say I had a measure
if your IQ and your IQ and your IQ and your</a>

you and you and you, and I summed your answers,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h41m00s">Now what would happen is, there'd be some
correlation between your total score on those</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h45m05s">And so the reduction, the reduced narrow strip
that we use to perceive the world in partly</a>
00:45:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h45m11s">is a consequence of processing inadequacy.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h45m14s">But it's also partly because we really are
trying to reduce things all the time to 0</a>
00:45:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h45m19s">and 1, yes and no.</a>
00:45:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h45m21s">Okay, so back to the three stratum theory
of cognitive abilities.</a>
00:45:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h45m26s">Now, you've got this array of 12 items and
it keeps shifting.</a>
00:45:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h45m33s">And what I would do is score you by the number
of duplications--if you pick the same item</a>
00:45:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h45m39s">more than once, you lose a point.</a>
00:45:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h45m41s">So the maximum points you can get is 12 and,
you know, people usually make 3 or 4 mistakes.</a>
00:45:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h45m45s">And so I can take your score on that test--maybe
I'd give it to you 2 or 3 times just to make</a>
00:45:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h45m50s">sure I have a reasonably stable indicator--and
then I could correlate it with your full-scale</a>
00:45:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h45m55s">fluid IQ.</a>
00:45:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h45m56s">And I'd get a correlation of about 0.25 or
0.3.</a>
00:45:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h45m59s">Now, if you don't know anything about psychometrics
you'd say, well that's obviously measuring</a>
00:45:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h46m04s">something different than full scale IQ because
it only correlates at 0.25 or 0.3.</a>
00:46:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h46m10s">But what it turns out is, no: it's more analogous
to the problem that we were just talking about</a>
00:46:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h46m14s">where I asked you three questions and tried
to derive your entire IQ from that.</a>
00:46:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h46m18s">It's just a bad measurement.</a>
00:46:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h46m21s">Now what happens is if you take the neuropsychological
tests that people have developed, that theoretically</a>
00:46:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h46m26s">assess the different parts of the brain, and
you factor analyze them and you extract out</a>
00:46:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h46m33s">a single factor, the single factor looks exactly
like fluid intelligence.</a>
00:46:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h46m38s">Now, is it exactly the same as fluid intelligence?</a>
00:46:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h46m45s">The onus would be on the person who claims
it's not to demonstrate the difference.</a>
00:46:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h46m49s">We did give university students a very extensive
battery of pre-frontal-cortical tests and</a>
00:46:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h46m56s">measured their IQ, and then we used the pre-frontal-cortical
test average and the IQ to predict grades.</a>
00:46:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h47m03s">And what we did find was the pre-frontal tests
predicted over and above the IQ.</a>
00:47:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h47m08s">But we thought maybe, if you took the pre-frontal
average and IQ and you added them to predict</a>
00:47:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h47m17s">grades, say--that's a regression analysis--they
both added in.</a>
00:47:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h47m21s">So they predicted different parts of the variation.</a>
00:47:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h47m25s">It added additional necessary information.</a>
00:47:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h47m29s">However, if you took all the neuropsychological
tests and all the individual IQ tests and</a>
00:47:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h47m34s">you put them in one data set and then extracted
out a single factor--so that would be fluid</a>
00:47:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h47m39s">intelligence, roughly speaking--that predicted
grades very well.</a>
00:47:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h47m43s">And then what was left over didn't predict
at all.</a>
00:47:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h47m46s">So what we concluded was that neuropsychological
tests--pre-frontal-cortical tests--test intelligence,</a>
00:47:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h47m53s">and they test a slightly different thing than
fluid intelligence tests do, but that isn't</a>
00:47:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h48m00s">because they're testing something different,
it's because fluid intelligence tests the</a>
00:48:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h48m03s">way they're currently constituted--don't sample
the universe of potential questions as well</a>
00:48:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h48m10s">as they should.</a>
00:48:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h48m12s">So it wasn't that we discovered something
different, we discovered a measurement error,</a>
00:48:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h48m16s">roughly speaking.</a>
00:48:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h48m17s">That only took 5 years by the way.</a>
00:48:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h48m18s">It took 5 years to figure that out.</a>
00:48:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h48m20s">It was very annoying because when we started
I was trying to predict grades, you know,</a>
00:48:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h48m26s">and I didn't know the IQ literature very well
at that point, because psychologists don't</a>
00:48:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h48m31s">usually teach it very much, because IQ bothers
the hell out of everybody.</a>
00:48:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h48m36s">And so, and the neuropsychologists who have
their own field are motivated to make the</a>
00:48:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h48m43s">claim that they've discovered something new
and I just took that on face value.</a>
00:48:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h48m48s">But then we tried to predict--like okay if
I'm going to predict how well you do at your</a>
00:48:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h48m52s">job, well I want to get a good cognitive measure
because if it's a complex job it keeps changing</a>
00:48:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h48m58s">and you have to learn to keep up, and if you
can't do that, you're not going to do very</a>
00:48:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h49m01s">well.</a>
00:49:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h49m02s">So that would be bad for you and it would
be bad for everyone around you.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h49m05s">And so we were trying to pick up additional
information that would enable the accuracy</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h49m13s">of the prediction to be increased, and looked
at the neuropsych literature but, at most,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h49m19s">it was an ambivalent success.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h49m20s">(00:49:25)
Okay, so how does that relate to this?</a>
00:49:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h49m23s">Well at the bottom tier, where it's the most
differentiated, you have single tests.</a>
00:49:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h49m28s">And they're only correlated with each other
at about 0.2, maybe 0.3.</a>
00:49:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h49m32s">So you might say, well, they're all measuring
different things--they're not.</a>
00:49:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h49m35s">They're all measuring the same thing badly.</a>
00:49:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h49m38s">And then you might clump them.</a>
00:49:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h49m40s">So let's say I ask you--oh god--maybe I give
you a test that asks you--that tested your</a>
00:49:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h49m47s">vocabulary with 6-letter words, and then I
gave you another test that tested your vocabulary</a>
00:49:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h49m51s">with 7-letter words, and then another one
that tested your vocabulary with 8-letter</a>
00:49:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h49m55s">words.</a>
00:49:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h49m56s">And I said, well those are all different tests.</a>
00:49:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h49m57s">Well they would correlate quite highly--not
perfectly--but I could clump them together</a>
00:49:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h50m02s">and make one sort of super test out of them.</a>
00:50:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h50m05s">And then I could take supertest A and supertest
B and supertest C and look at the correlations</a>
00:50:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h50m11s">between those, and those would climb to about
0.5 or 0.6.</a>
00:50:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h50m15s">And then if I clumped the supertests together,
which would be happening by the time we got</a>
00:50:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h50m18s">to stratum 2 there, then the correlation between
the tests would start to rise to about 0.7.</a>
00:50:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h50m25s">And then if I collapsed all the supertests
into a single measure, then the correlation</a>
00:50:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h50m30s">between any of those stratum 2 tests and G,
because that would be the highest level thing--G</a>
00:50:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h50m35s">is general intelligence, that's roughly speaking
fluid intelligence--the correlation between</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h50m40s">any of the supertests and G would be about
0.8.</a>
00:50:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h50m45s">So the point of all this--there's no way of
discussing this sort of thing without doing</a>
00:50:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h50m50s">it statistically and technically because they
are statistical and technical processes.</a>
00:50:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h50m54s">So what happens is that, now let's say now
you have a measure of fluid intelligence.</a>
00:50:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h51m01s">Okay, you've got this measure.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h51m50s">It's not--the tests aren't highly correlated

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h52m10s">would wipe out stability--it'd be a better

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h52m26s">That's a good representation of how these

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h52m29s">So at the bottom you have the single tests
and then they chunk into, say, sequential</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h52m34s">reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and induction

fluid intelligence, which is the measure that</a>
00:52:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h52m49s">you really want to have.</a>
00:52:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h52m51s">Okay, so what good is that?</a>
00:52:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h52m55s">Well, it basically correlates 0.5 with major
life outcomes.</a>
00:52:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h53m02s">And that's 25% of the variance, and maybe
you can get it a bit higher than that, but</a>
00:53:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h53m07s">we'll just stick with 0.5 as a representation.</a>
00:53:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h53m12s">And so, let's 
say you take a bunch of students, 100 of them,</a>
00:53:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h53m22s">and you want to sort them into those who will
pass the class with a 50% failure rate.</a>
00:53:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h53m29s">So you just pick them randomly--you're going
to pass, you're going to fail, you're going</a>
00:53:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h53m32s">to pass, you're going to fail.</a>
00:53:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h53m33s">So that's no knowledge.</a>
00:53:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h53m34s">I have no predictive knowledge whatsoever.</a>
00:53:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h53m35s">So my validity--the validity of my classification
is basically going to be equivalent to chance:</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h53m43s">Right, I'm only going to have a 50% chance
of picking who passes and who fails.</a>
00:53:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h53m47s">If I used IQs--if I had all your IQ scores--and
I did the prediction, I'd get it right 75%</a>

00:53:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h53m58s">It cuts the failure rate in half by using

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h59m19s">And a lot of that's been hammered out of modern

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h59m21s">You know, so 150 years ago people's IQ was

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h59m35s">And that's flattened out a lot of the cultural

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h59m44s">Okay, so this guy named Hemphill did this
paper--an American psychologist a while back--and</a>
00:59:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h59m54s">one of the things he was interested in doing--remember
we talked about effect sizes, right.</a>
00:59:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=00h59m58s">How big is an effect in psychology or in social
sciences in general?</a>
00:59:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h00m03s">And people have used rules of thumb that 0.5
was a moderate effect and 0.3 was a minimal</a>
01:00:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h00m10s">effect and 0.2 was starting to diminish to
the point of non-utility.</a>
01:00:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h00m16s">But what Hemphill did instead of guessing,
because that was just a guess, was actually</a>
01:00:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h00m21s">go and look at papers that were published
in psychology to see what effect sizes were</a>
01:00:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h00m25s">being reported.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h00m27s">So it's empirical analysis of how big the

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h00m42s">had the biggest effects reported effects from
0.35 to 0.78, the middle third from 0.21 to</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h00m50s">0.33, and the lower third from 0.02 to 0.21.</a>

01:01:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h01m13s">So 50% of psychological studies report an

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h01m19s">90% report an r of less than 0.5, and only
7 to 8% report an r of 0.5 or above.</a>
01:01:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h01m29s">So what that means is that the relationship
between IQ and, say, academic performance</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h03m19s">And so, you think, that's not all that bright.</a>
01:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h03m24s">But that's brighter than 7 out of 8 people

01:03:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h03m44s">So about 70% of people fall between the 15th

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h03m49s">At the 15th percentile you're not really very

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h05m11s">My suspicions are that the average IQ of people

01:08:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h08m08s">then there's low complexity/high complexity.</a>

01:08:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h08m16s">still one person in three--are low complexity,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h08m46s">What happens then, in all likelihood, is that

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h08m50s">emotional stability starts to predict, or

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h09m05s">And that's not so good because you have the

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h10m29s">a computer and distribute it--it's like, well
that wasn't very helpful because he didn't</a>
01:10:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h10m32s">know how to use a computer and he wasn't going
to type up his damn resume.</a>
01:10:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h10m37s">It was, "if you want to get a job, go out
and do the things that it would take to get</a>
01:10:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h10m41s">a job."</a>
01:10:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h10m42s">Well yeah, if you can do that then you don't
have a problem.</a>
01:10:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h10m45s">And so the government agencies were completely
useless, and they were staffed by people who</a>
01:10:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h10m49s">would assume that if you didn't do what you
were advised to, then you just didn't want</a>
01:10:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h10m54s">to have a job.</a>
01:10:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h10m55s">Instead of ever thinking that maybe you couldn't
do it.</a>
01:10:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h10m56s">It's not the easy to use a computer.</a>
01:10:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h11m01s">And then I tried to get him a volunteer job--well
you can bloody well forget about that because</a>
01:11:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h11m05s">it's harder to get a volunteer job than it
is to get a real job.</a>
01:11:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h11m09s">And the reason for that is that you have to
step through a number of complex bureaucratic</a>
01:11:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h11m12s">hoops, including having a police check.</a>
01:11:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h11m16s">And you know, first of all that's intimidating
as hell for people, even if they haven't done</a>
01:11:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h11m19s">anything wrong.</a>
01:11:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h11m20s">And second, it's not that straightforward.</a>
01:11:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h11m22s">It involves manoeuvring through a complicated
bureaucracy, and that's not the only step.</a>
01:11:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h11m28s">There's all sorts of other steps.</a>
01:11:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h11m29s">So volunteer work, that's out man.</a>
01:11:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h11m32s">That's just not going to happen, not generally
speaking.</a>
01:11:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h11m36s">And then I found him a job helping a guy out
who had a bicycle shop/book store--kind of</a>
01:11:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h11m42s">a strange combination--but it was a government
subsidized temporary position.</a>
01:11:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h11m46s">And then, he did a good job at it--he was
reshelving books and that sort of thing--and</a>
01:11:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h11m51s">so he was reliable.</a>
01:11:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h11m52s">He could do that.</a>
01:11:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h11m53s">But, you know, the subsidy program ended and
of course, if you run a bike shop/book store</a>
01:11:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h11m59s">it's not like you have additional money to
hire someone because, that's a store that's</a>
01:11:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h12m03s">just not going to be generating maybe any
income, but certainly not enough to hire someone.</a>
01:12:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h12m08s">So that fell apart.</a>
01:12:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h12m10s">Then I made a bunch of personal contacts with
charity organizations to see if I could get</a>
01:12:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h12m18s">him a volunteer position.</a>
01:12:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h12m19s">I finally got </a>
01:12:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h12m22s">And then I went with him to train at the volunteer
position, and that was so enlightening.</a>
01:12:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h12m27s">So what he had to do was, he had a stack of
pieces of paper here and then a stack of envelopes</a>
01:12:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h12m35s">here, and in principle the pieces of paper--which
were letters--were in the same order as the</a>
01:12:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h12m41s">envelopes were.</a>
01:12:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h12m42s">And so what he had to do was fold the pieces
of paper three times and stuff the folded</a>
01:12:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h12m46s">piece of paper into the envelope and the seal
the envelope and then put it here.</a>
01:12:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h12m50s">But it was a bit more complicated than that
because sometimes the letters were in French</a>
01:12:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h12m55s">and sometimes they were in English, so what
that meant was that he had to watch and see</a>
01:12:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h13m01s">that the French envelopes went into this stack
and the English envelopes went into that stack.</a>
01:13:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h13m05s">So that's one degree of complexity, right.</a>
01:13:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h13m08s">But then it also turned out that those damned
envelopes had to be run through an automatic</a>
01:13:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h13m12s">letter sorting machine.</a>
01:13:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h13m14s">Now you might think, well that doesn't matter,
but it does matter because those things have</a>
01:13:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h13m17s">very tightly defined tolerances.</a>
01:13:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h13m21s">And if you make a mistake--imagine you fold
a piece of paper and the first time you fold</a>
01:13:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h13m28s">it you made a mistake of an eighth of an inch.</a>
01:13:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h13m31s">And then the next time you fold it you make
another eighth of an inch mistake.</a>
01:13:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h13m34s">That means your piece of paper is now one
quarter inch out of truth.</a>
01:13:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h13m39s">And then you stuff it in the envelope and
fold it, but then you crinkle the envelope.</a>
01:13:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h13m43s">And so then the envelope gets stuck in the
automatic processing machine.</a>
01:13:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h13m47s">So I taught him probably 20 hours, how to
fold this piece of paper into three.</a>
01:13:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h13m54s">You know, and he was a bit shaky, and he just
didn't have the fine motor ability or the</a>
01:13:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h13m59s">cognitive ability to do that.</a>
01:13:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h14m02s">And then--I'll end with this--when he finally
couldn't do it anymore, what happened was</a>
01:14:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h14m07s">the letters came with photographs attached
to them.</a>
01:14:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h14m10s">And then he had to fold the pieces of paper
around the photographs in a way that didn't</a>
01:14:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h14m14s">crumple the photographs so that they could
still fit into the envelopes.</a>
01:14:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h14m17s">And each photo was stapled, maybe half an
inch different, per piece of paper.</a>
01:14:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h14m24s">So then he had to fold them properly with
a different folding technique for every piece</a>
01:14:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h14m30s">of paper, and he had to sort them into French
and English, and then also if the envelopes</a>
01:14:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h14m34s">and the papers ever got out of sync--which
they did now and then--he had to figure out</a>
01:14:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h14m38s">how to sort the envelopes and the pieces of
paper to make sure that they were matched</a>
01:14:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h14m42s">with the proper envelope.</a>
01:14:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h14m43s">It was like, no.</a>
01:14:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h14m44s">That was the end of it.</a>
01:14:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h14m47s">And so I'll tell you the rest of this story
later.</a>
01:14:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h14m52s">So anyways, the moral of the story is if you're
smart, you're privileged and, thank god, make</a>
01:14:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h14m59s">use of it.</a>
01:14:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h15m00s">And if you're on the low end of the IQ distribution,
man, you've got one tough life ahead of you.</a>
01:15:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h15m04s">It has nothing to do with willingness to work,
or virtually nothing.</a>
01:15:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRFxulvRC7I#t=01h15m09s">And it's a good thing to know, even though
it's horrible.</a>
