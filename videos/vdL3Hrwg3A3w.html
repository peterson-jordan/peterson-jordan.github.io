					<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h00m00s">You know, this is something my wife has pointed out too, she said:</a>
00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h00m03s">"Well, men are gonna have to stand up for themselves".
But here's the problem:</a>
00:00:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h00m06s">I know how to stand up to a man, who's unfairly trespassing against me.</a>
00:00:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h00m13s">And the reason I know that, is because the parameters for my resistance are quite well-defined.</a>
00:00:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h00m18s">Which is: we talk, we argue, we push, and then it becomes physical.</a>
00:00:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h00m24s">Right? Like, if we move beyond the boundaries of civil discourse, we know what the next step is.</a>
00:00:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h00m29s">Ok - that's forbidden in discourse with women.</a>
00:00:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h00m33s">And so, I don't think that men can control crazy women.</a>
00:00:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h00m36s">I don't thi- I really don't believe it. I think that they have to throw their hands up</a>
00:00:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h00m40s">in, in what... it's not even disbelief. It's that the cultural...</a>
00:00:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h00m47s">There's no step forward, that you can take under those circumstances.</a>
00:00:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h00m50s">Because if the man is offensive enough and crazy enough, the reaction becomes physical right away, or at least the threat is there.</a>
00:00:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h00m57s">And when men are talking to each other in any serious manner,</a>
00:00:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h01m01s">that underlying threat of physicality is always there.</a>
00:01:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h01m04s">Especially if it's a real conversation, and it keeps the thing civilized to some degree.</a>
00:01:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h01m08s">You know, if you're talking to a man who wouldn't fight with you under any circumstances whatsoever,</a>
00:01:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h01m14s">then you're talking to someone, to whom you have absolutely no respect.</a>
00:01:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h01m17s">But I can't see any way...</a>
00:01:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h01m19s">For example, there's woman in Toronto, who's been</a>
00:01:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h01m23s">organizing this movement, let's say, against me and some other people, who are gonna do a free speech event.</a>
00:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h01m29s">And she managed to organize quite effectively.</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h01m32s">And she's quite, um, offensive, you might say.</a>
00:01:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h01m35s">She compared us to Nazis, for example, which, you know - publicly, using the swastika - which wasn't really something I was all that fond of.</a>
00:01:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h01m42s">But I'm defenseless against that kind of female insanity, because the...</a>
00:01:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h01m48s">...techniques, that I would use against a man who was employing those tactics, are forbidden to me.</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h01m53s">So, I don't know - like, it seems to me that it isn't men, that have to stand up and say "Enough of this!", even though that is what they should do.</a>
00:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h02m00s">It seems to me, that it's sane women who have to stand up against their crazy sisters, and say: "Look, enough of that. Enough man-hating.</a>
00:02:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h02m07s">Enough pathology. Enough bringing disgrace on us as a gender".</a>
00:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h02m13s">But the problem there (and then I'll stop my little tirade), is that</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h02m17s">most of the women I know, who are sane, are busy doing sane things, right?</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h02m22s">They're off: They have their career, they have their family, they're quite occupied.</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h02m25s">And they don't seem to have the time, or maybe even the interest, to go after their their crazy harpy sisters.</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h02m31s">And so I don't see any regulating force for that terrible femininity. And it seems to me to be...</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3Hrwg3A3w#t=00h02m38s">...invading the culture, and undermining the masculine power of the culture in a way, that's - I think - fatal.</a>
