00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h00m01s">Well, unknown unknowns come your way from places you don't expect.</a>
00:00:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h00m07s">Because otherwise you would have prepared for that damn thing.</a>
00:00:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h00m09s">So, these are the things that always open their mouths to you when you aren't expecting them.</a>
00:00:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h00m14s">They're just like, say, snakes in the garden of Eden, that's maybe one way of thinking about it.</a>
00:00:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h00m18s">You can't keep the damn snakes out of the yard.</a>
00:00:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h00m21s">And that's because you can't create boundaries to keep complexity out.</a>
00:00:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h00m25s">Complexity always secretly returns. Try to defend your kids from the internet</a>
00:00:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h00m30s">For example.</a>
00:00:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h00m32s">You cannot create boundaries to keep complexity out, it always comes back secretly.</a>
00:00:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h00m37s">So what would an unknown obscurity be? That's a good one. Here,</a>
00:00:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h00m41s">You are in an intimate relationship. You have this for 10 years. You trust your partner.</a>
00:00:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h00m45s">So what does that mean?</a>
00:00:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h00m47s">You know where you are. You know who you are. And you also have a reasonable idea of ​​where you are going.</a>
00:00:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h00m54s">And then one day you find out that your partner has cheated, not with one person but with three.</a>
00:00:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h01m00s">During the whole 10 years!</a>
00:01:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h01m02s">Well, hypothetically, that comes as a shock. But you may have missed many indications indicating this.</a>
00:01:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h01m10s">Non relevant!</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h01m11s">Let's just say it comes as a shock, what happens to you?</a>
00:01:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h01m15s">You don't know where you are.</a>
00:01:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h01m18s">You don't know where you've been! That is interesting!</a>
00:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h01m21s">Because you think you know where you are because you've already been there.</a>
00:01:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h01m25s">But suddenly something happens and you are so upset that you don't even know where you were.</a>
00:01:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h01m31s">So in a way that means that the past depends on the now. A very strange thing.</a>
00:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h01m37s">You also have no idea where you are going.</a>
00:01:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h01m40s">As for 'not knowing where you are going', that's very deep.</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h01m45s">You might think "I thought I was in a marriage" that's wrong,</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h01m49s">"I thought I knew who my wife / husband was", that's also wrong.</a>
00:01:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h01m55s">"Because I thought I knew my wife, I thought I knew women in general", that's wrong.</a>
00:01:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h02m01s">"I thought I was in a relationship with someone I could trust," that's wrong.</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h02m06s">"I know too little about trust, I am clearly too gullible."</a>
00:02:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h02m09s">And with all of that happening, I doubt everything that ever happened to me, yes?</a>
00:02:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h02m15s">That is the appearance of chaos!</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h02m17s">And that is..</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h02m20s">This! Sometimes you go from point A to point B and something you don't expect manifests itself in the middle of your plan.</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h02m29s">But it is not such a disaster, because you can just get around it.</a>
00:02:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h02m32s">And sometimes something shows up and oh, then you just don't have a plan anymore.</a>
00:02:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h02m38s">And then you ask yourself, where exactly are you when you don't know where you are?</a>
00:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h02m43s">I'd say that's a place! And it is actually a place that is very well documented in classical and religious mythological stories.</a>
00:02:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h02m52s">That's chaos.</a>
00:02:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h02m53s">The Daoists, for example, believe that the world is made of chaos and order.</a>
00:02:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h02m57s">Order, that's where you are when what you do gives you back what you want.</a>
00:02:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h03m02s">Chaos.</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h03m03s">That's where you are when you have no idea what's going on.</a>
00:03:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h03m06s">And then you may ask, is there any way you should behave when you are in chaos?</a>
00:03:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h03m11s">The answer to that is: there is a better way.</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h03m13s">Because it is a place that you will visit several times in your life. And everyone visits this place.</a>
00:03:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h03m20s">Therefore it is an archetypal story, it is the descent to the underworld.</a>
00:03:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h03m23s">The underworld is that awful place that lies beneath all of our presuppositions.</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h03m28s">It is it .. Cold lake hidden under the thin ice that everyone skates on.</a>
00:03:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h03m34s">And it is something that can manifest at any time.</a>
00:03:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h03m37s">That's probably why in the Daoist symbol, the black paisley is chaos by the way and the white is order,</a>
00:03:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h03m43s">In the Order paisley is a little black dot, that's because order can turn into chaos, which it does, at any time.</a>
00:03:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h03m51s">And the reverse is also true. Chaos can change right at any time.</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h03m55s">And insight will do that for you. And alcoholics say when they hit their bottom</a>
00:03:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h04m00s">then it's like * click * there is catalysis and they look at the world in a different way.</a>
00:04:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h04m04s">Now they are a new person, they have returned from the underworld, returned from the dead, so to speak.</a>
00:04:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h04m10s">And this is partly because your right hemisphere seems to be good at this,</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h04m14s">infer patterns in chaotic places. It keeps track of what abnormal things are happening.</a>
00:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h04m22s">And it makes alternate maps of the world that are there for you to use.</a>
00:04:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGzUqFcHSs#t=00h04m27s">At least to some point, if ever necessary.</a>
