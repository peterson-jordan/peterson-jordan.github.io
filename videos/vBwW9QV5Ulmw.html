<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwW9QV5Ulmw#t=00h43m10s">So I'm starting with Contin Rousseau. I'm talking about Hegel marx, nietzsche Heidegger and the others so</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwW9QV5Ulmw#t=00h43m36s">So there is a range of scholarly movement and most of these major</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwW9QV5Ulmw#t=00h43m50s">contour unmeet or Heidegger or whatever will be</a>
00:43:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwW9QV5Ulmw#t=00h43m53s">From those who are in a different school of interpretation with respect to them, but typically among the Philosopher's it's a respectful</a>
00:43:53</p>

00:44:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwW9QV5Ulmw#t=00h44m10s">and typically then what I'm doing is emphasizing the skeptical elements or they ultimately</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwW9QV5Ulmw#t=00h44m28s">Well, you know this particular thinker is not that bad or you would not buy into the whole</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwW9QV5Ulmw#t=00h44m33s">Project. Those are the ones who will criticize me on various things, but I typically find though outside of philosophical circles</a>
00:44:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwW9QV5Ulmw#t=00h44m41s">though is and that this is not a criticism of these individuals since we can't know ever thing is that they</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwW9QV5Ulmw#t=00h44m48s">Will know something about Nietzsche or Heidegger or or Conte, but they're not up on the scholarly literature</a>
00:44:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwW9QV5Ulmw#t=00h44m54s">You know, they've read one book or one article about that person that was written from a certain perspective</a>
00:44:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwW9QV5Ulmw#t=00h44m59s">So if I make the argument for the other perspective on that thinker it's new to them and it seems outrageous to them</a>
00:44:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwW9QV5Ulmw#t=00h45m05s">And so they will react negatively to it. So something like that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwW9QV5Ulmw#t=00h45m12s">So now you wrote this book back in 2004. So you were pretty early observer of</a>
