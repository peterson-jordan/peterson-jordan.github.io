<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h01m25s">Like if you're naive and you move forward, it's like well what the hell do you know.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h01m28s">You know... There is no courage in naivety, because you don't know what there is to stop you.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h01m42s">or to be fully self-conscious means that you're perfectly aware of your limitations or how you might be hurt</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h02m00s">the clinical literature on this is very, very clear.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h02m09s">You lay out what they're anxious about, first of all.</a>
00:02:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h02m12s">In detail. What is it that your're afraid of. What might happen.</a>
00:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h02m15s">And then you decompose it into small problems, hypothetically manageable problems.</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h02m21s">And then you have the person expose themselves to the thing that they're afraid of.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h02m25s">And what happens isn't that they get less afraid. That isn't what the clinical literature...</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h02m29s">...indicates, exactly.</a>
00:02:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h02m31s">What happens instead is they get braver.</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h02m33s">And that's not the same thing, right? Because if you get less afraid, it's like:</a>
00:02:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h02m37s">"Well the world isn't as dangerous as i thought it was", you know, "silly me..."</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h02m40s">If you get braver, that's not what happens. What happens is "Yeah, the damn world is just as dangerous as I thought...</a>

00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h02m55s">And there's no doubt about this. Even the psychophysiological findings are quite clear</a>

00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h03m06s">on one group the stressor is imposed involuntarily</a>
00:03:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h03m09s">and in the other group the stressor is picked up voluntarily</a>
00:03:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h03m14s">The people who pick up the stressor voluntarily use a whole different psychophysiological system to deal with it.</a>
00:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h03m20s">They use the system that's associated with approach and challenge.</a>
00:03:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h03m23s">And not the system that's associated with defensive aggression and withdrawal.</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h03m28s">And the system that's associated with challenge is much more associated with positive emotion</a>
00:03:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h03m33s">and much less associated with negative emotion.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h03m35s">It's also much less hard on, you because the defensive posturing system (the pray animal system)</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h03m42s">man, when that thing kicks in, it's all systems are go for you. You know...</a>
00:03:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h03m45s">The gas is pushed down to the... or the pedal is pushed down to the metal and the breaks are on</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h03m50s">You're using future resources that you could be storing for future time right now in the present to ready yourself for emergency.</a>
00:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h03m58s">There's nothing simple or trivial at all about the idea of being called to move forthrightly forward</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h04m04s">into the strange and unknown.</a>
00:04:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h04m06s">And there's real adventure that's associated with that. Right?</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h04m09s">So that's an exciting thing, which is part of the reason why people travel.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h04m13s">And then also to see yourself as the sort of creature that can do that - is willing to do that on a habitual basis</a>
00:04:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h04m19s">is also the right kind of tonic for - I hate this word - for your self-esteem.</a>
00:04:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h04m25s">You know. Because the self-esteem has nothing to do with feeling good about yourself.</a>
00:04:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h04m28s">As I already mentioned.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h04m30s">There isn't necessarily a reason why apriori you should just feel good about yourself. But</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqUj42vefg0#t=00h04m35s">if you can view yourself acting in a courageous and forthright manner</a>
