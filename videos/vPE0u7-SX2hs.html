00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h00m02s">Well, let's step one step backwards.</a>
00:00:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h00m05s">The first question might be: Why should you even bother improving yourself?</a>
00:00:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h00m09s">And I think  the answer to that is something like</a>
00:00:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h00m11s">so you don't suffer anymore stupidly than you have to.</a>
00:00:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h00m15s">And maybe so others don't have to either. It's something like that.</a>
00:00:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h00m18s">You know, like, there is a real adjunction at the bottom of it.</a>
00:00:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h00m20s">It's not some casual self-help doctrine,</a>
00:00:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h00m22s">it's that if you don't organize yourself properly: you'll pay for it!</a>
00:00:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h00m27s">And in a big way. And so will the people around you.</a>
00:00:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h00m31s">And you can say: 'Well, I don't care about that!'</a>
00:00:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h00m33s">but that's actually not true, you actually DO care about that.</a>
00:00:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h00m35s">Because if you're in pain you will care about it.</a>
00:00:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h00m38s">And so you DO care about it even if it's just that negative way, you know.</a>
00:00:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h00m43s">It's very rare that you can find someone who is in excruciating pain who would ever say</a>

00:00:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h00m51s">This sort of pain is one of those things that brings the idea that it would be better</a>
00:00:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h00m56s">if it didn't exist along with it.</a>
00:00:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h00m58s">It's incontrovertible.</a>
00:00:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h01m00s">So you get your act together so that there isn't any more stupid pain around you that necessary.</a>
00:01:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h01m06s">So then the question might be: how would you go about getting your act together?</a>
00:01:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h01m09s">And the answer to that -</a>
00:01:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h01m10s">- and this is a phenomenological idea, too -</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h01m12s">it's something like: Look around for something that bothers you</a>
00:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h01m17s">and see if you can fix it.</a>
00:01:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h01m19s">So now you think, well...</a>
00:01:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h01m22s">Let's say you go into...</a>
00:01:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h01m24s">You can do this in a room, it's quite fun to do it.</a>
00:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h01m27s">Just when you're sitting in a room - maybe your bedroom -</a>
00:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h01m29s">you can sit there and just sort of meditate on it and think:</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h01m32s">'Okay, if I wanted to spend ten minutes making this room better,</a>
00:01:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h01m37s">what would I have to do?'</a>
00:01:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h01m38s">And you have to ask yourself that. It's not a command, it's like a genuine question.</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h01m42s">And things will pop out in the room like</a>
00:01:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h01m45s">there's a stack of papers over there that's kind of bugging you</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h01m47s">and you know that maybe a little order there would be a good thing.</a>
00:01:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h01m52s">There's some rubbish behind your computer monitor that you haven't attended to for like six months.</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h01m57s">The room would be slightly better if it was a little less dusty and the cables weren't all tangled up the same way.</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h02m03s">If you allow yourself just to consider the expanse in which you exist at that moment</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h02m11s">there will be all sorts of things that pop out in it that you could just fix.</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h02m15s">And you know I might say well, if you were coming to see me for psychotherapy</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h02m19s">the easiest thing for us to do first would just be to get you to organize your room</a>
00:02:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h02m24s">You think: 'Well, is that psychotherapy?'</a>
00:02:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h02m26s">And the answer is: it depends on how you conceive the limits of your being.</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h02m32s">And I would say: start where you can start!</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h02m35s">You know, if something announces itself to you</a>
00:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h02m39s">- which is a strange way of thinking about it -</a>
00:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h02m40s">as 'in need of repair' that you COULD repair</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h02m44s">then, hey! Fix it!</a>
00:02:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h02m46s">You fix a hundred things like that, your life will be a lot different.</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h02m51s">Now, I often tell people too: fix the things you repeat every day.</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h02m55s">Because people tend to think of those as trivial.</a>
00:02:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h02m58s">You get up, you brush your teeth, you have your breakfast...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h03m01s">You have your routines that you go through every day.</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h03m04s">Those probably constitute fifty percent of your life!</a>
00:03:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h03m08s">And people think: 'They are mundane, I don't need to pay attention to them.'</a>
00:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h03m11s">No, no, that's exactly wrong.</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h03m13s">The things you do every day: those are the most important things you do.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h03m17s">Hands down, all you have to do is do the arithmetic.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h03m20s">You figured out right away.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h03m22s">So, a hundred adjustments to your broader domain of being</a>
00:03:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h03m27s">and there's a lot less rubbish around a lot fewer traps for you to step into.</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h03m34s">And so that's in keeping with Jung's idea about erasing the this...</a>
00:03:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h03m39s">Once you got your mind and your emotions together and once you're acting that out,</a>
00:03:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h03m44s">then you can extend what you are willing to consider your self</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h03m49s">and start fixing up the things that are part of your broader extend.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h03m54s">Now, sometimes you don't know how to do that.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h03m55s">Imagine you are walking down blur street and</a>
00:03:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h03m58s">there is this guy who is alcoholic and schizophrenic and has been on the streets for ten years.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h04m55s">Go back to where you live and sit down and think: 'Okay,</a>
00:04:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h04m58s">I'm gonna make this place better for half an hour - what should I do?'</a>
00:04:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h05m02s">You have to ASK and things will just pop up like mad</a>
00:05:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h05m07s">and it's partly because your mind is a very strange thing and as soon as you give it an aim</a>
00:05:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h05m12s">- a genuine aim - it'll reconfigure the world in keeping with that aim.</a>
00:05:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h05m16s">That's actually how you see to begin with.</a>
00:05:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h05m18s">So if you set it a task... You have to be genuine about it</a>
00:05:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h05m22s">which is why you have to bring your thoughts and emotions together</a>
00:05:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h05m26s">and then you have to get them in your body so you're acting consistently.</a>
00:05:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h05m29s">You have to be genuine about the aim</a>
00:05:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h05m31s">but once you aim the world will reconfigure itself around that aim, which is very strange.</a>
00:05:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h05m38s">It's technically true!</a>
00:05:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h05m42s">The best example of that</a>
00:05:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h05m44s">- you have all seen this video where you watch the basketballs being tossed back and forth</a>
00:05:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h05m50s">between members of the white team versus the black team</a>
00:05:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h05m53s">and while you are doing that a gorilla walks up into the middle of the video and you don't see it.</a>
00:05:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h05m58s">If you thought about that experiment for about five years, that would be about the right amount of time</a>
00:05:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h06m03s">to spend thinking about it.</a>
00:06:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h06m04s">Because what it shows you is that you see what you aim at.</a>
00:06:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h06m08s">And that - man! - if you can get one thing through your head as a consequence of even being in university</a>
00:06:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h06m13s">THAT would be a good one: You see what you aim at.</a>
00:06:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h06m16s">And so, because one inference you might draw from that is: Be careful what you aim at!</a>
00:06:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h06m23s">Right? What you aim at determines the way the world manifests itself to you</a>
00:06:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h06m28s">So if the world is manifesting itself in a very negative way</a>
00:06:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h06m33s">one thing to ask is: Are you aiming at the right thing?</a>
00:06:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h06m36s">You know I'm not trying to reduce everybody's problems to an improper aim.</a>
00:06:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h06m41s">People get cut off at the knees for all sorts of reasons.</a>
00:06:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h06m44s">They get sick, they have accidents.</a>
00:06:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h06m46s">There's a random element to being, that's for sure, but -</a>
00:06:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h06m49s">You don't want to take anything, even that particular phrase, too far</a>
00:06:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h06m53s">You want to bind it with the fact that random things do happen to people.</a>
00:06:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0u7-SX2hs#t=00h06m57s">But it's still a great thing to ask.</a>
