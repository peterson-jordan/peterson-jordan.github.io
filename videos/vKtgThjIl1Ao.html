00:09:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h09m44s">He said: the reason that hell is characterized
by its structure is not so much because of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h09m48s">its nature precisely, it’s because of its

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h09m53s">So the farther you are away, say, from what
constitutes the good, the more suffering is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h10m09s">the notion of hell per se because how in the

and we say something like this:</a>
00:10:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h10m31s">OK, we already know that part of the reason

00:10:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h10m38s">It’s a tool box, say.</a>
00:10:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h10m41s">We’re playing a game, we share the rules,
that’s fine, we can cooperate with one another.</a>
00:10:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h10m44s">It could be other than it is but it’s the
way it is and it works for us, that’s fine.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h10m49s">There’s nothing absolute about it except
that a structure like that is necessary.</a>
00:10:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h10m53s">Now whenever there’s a threat to that shared
view of the world, well then we’re afraid</a>
00:10:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h10m58s">and for good reason and it’s not surprising
under those circumstances that we fight to</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h25m16s">If you’re walking away from a domain that’s
likely to expand into something that’s completely</a>
00:25:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h25m25s">undifferentiable from hell, and it’s no
wonder you walk away from that, but the fact</a>
00:25:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h25m31s">that you walk away from it makes it much more
likely that it’s going to happen</a>
00:25:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h25m36s">So then I think, to end this, something like
this.</a>
00:25:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h25m41s">We look for economic reasons to explain great
terrible acts, right?</a>
00:25:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h25m46s">We look for social reasons, we look for political
reasons but we have Nietzsche’s observation,</a>
00:25:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h25m51s">which is something like this:
I don’t care whether or not your life’s</a>
00:25:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h25m55s">been characterized by suffering and deprivation.</a>
00:25:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h25m57s">The mere fact of suffering and deprivation
does not allow you to draw a particular conclusion.</a>
00:25:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h26m02s">You can’t say that there’s a causal path
between economic deprivation, say, and the</a>
00:26:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h26m06s">rise of a totalitarian state because any event
is susceptible to multiple interpretations.</a>
00:26:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h26m10s">Well, how do these states come about?</a>
00:26:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h26m12s">Well, I think: well, we look for political
and economic and social reasons because that’s</a>
00:26:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h26m18s">the easiest place top look, right?</a>
00:26:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h26m20s">If you ratchet up the level of description
to social forces that are beyond your control,</a>
00:26:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h26m24s">then you never have to worry about what it
is that you’re doing or not doing that’s</a>
00:26:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h26m28s">actually causing this sort of thing.</a>
00:26:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h26m29s">But I think if you look at the historical
record, especially if you look at it from</a>
00:26:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h26m33s">a mythological perspective, the story is basically
clear and it goes something like this:</a>
00:26:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h26m39s">Every time you make a mistake that you know
is a mistake and you don’t fix it, the world</a>
00:26:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h26m44s">moves more towards that.</a>
00:26:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h26m46s">And it might be trivial, maybe, but it might
not be.</a>
00:26:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h26m50s">So you look at Adolf Eichmann, for example,
and he’s a little bureaucrat who planned</a>
00:26:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h26m53s">the Final Solution and you find out he’s
just a little ratty guy, right?</a>
00:26:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h26m58s">You see him in a bar, you don’t even notice
him, he’s a negligible nobody.</a>
00:26:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h27m02s">But he’s the guy who planned the Final Solution.</a>
00:27:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h27m06s">He was a normal person, I mean maybe even
slightly less than normal, right?</a>
00:27:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h27m11s">He is no monster, he wasn’t the sort of
person you’d remark on if you saw him.</a>
00:27:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h27m16s">Precisely the opposite: invisible, quiet,
unassuming, presuming no doubt, at least until</a>
00:27:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgThjIl1Ao#t=00h27m22s">he was arrested, that he was just doing what
he was told and that was just fine.</a>
