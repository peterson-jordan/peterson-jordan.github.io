They know. It's like "This is what I want</a>

of their levels of agreeableness by the group,</a>
00:00:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h00m53s">if you go out and you look at the extremes,
they are very different.</a>
00:00:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h00m55s">So all of the most agreeable people are women,
 and all of the most</a>
00:00:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h00m59s">disagreeable people are men.</a>
00:00:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h01m00s">And the thing is the extremes</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h01m05s">And so one of the ways that's reflected
in society, by the way, is</a>
00:01:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h01m08s">there's way more men in prisson</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h01m13s">is to be low in agreeableness. It makes you callous.</a>
00:01:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h01m17s">Now you may think "Well, what's the opposite of compassion and politeness?"</a>
00:01:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h01m20s">And the answer to that is,</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h01m22s">I think it's best sort of conceptualized as a-</a>
00:01:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h01m25s">as a trading game.</a>
00:01:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h01m27s">So let's say that</a>
00:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h01m28s">we're going to play repeated trading games.
And if you're</a>
00:01:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h01m32s">very agreeable, then you're gonna bargain</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h01m35s">harder on my behalf, than you're gonna bargain on your own behalf.</a>
00:01:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h01m38s">Whereas if you're disagreable,
you're gonna do the reverse. You're gonna think</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h01m41s">"I'm in this trading game for me,

Where an agreeable person is gonna say "No, no.</a>

00:01:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h01m53s">One of the things you have
to be carefull of if you're agreeable,</a>
00:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h01m56s">is not to be exploited.</a>
00:01:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h01m57s">Because you'll line up to be exploited.</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h02m00s">And I think the reason for that is because</a>
00:02:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h02m01s">you're wired to be exploited by infants.</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h02m05s">And so, that just doesn't work
too well in the actual world.</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h02m08s">And one of the things, one of the things
that happens very often in psychotherapy</a>
00:02:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h02m11s">you know, people come to psychotherapy
for multiple reasons,</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h02m14s">but one of them is they often come
because they're too agreeable.</a>
00:02:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h02m17s">And so what they get is
so called 'Assertiveness Training'.</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h02m20s">Although it's not exactly assertiveness
that's being trained.</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h02m23s">What it is is the ability to learn how to
negotiate on your own behalf.</a>
00:02:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h02m27s">And one of the things I tell agreeable people, specially if they´re conscientious, is</a>
00:02:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h02m31s">Say what you think, tell the truth about what you think.</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h02m34s">There's gonna be things you think
that you think are nasty and harsh.</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h02m38s">And they probably are nasty and harsh,
but they're also probably true.</a>
00:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h02m42s">And you need to bring those up to the forefront
and deliver the message.</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h02m45s">And it's not straight-forward at all
because agreeable people</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h09m22s">or walk yourself through the right exercises, you can switch some of these other things on as well.</a>
00:09:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h09m27s">But it takes work, and dedication and discipline, too.</a>
00:09:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h09m30s">I would say generally speaking, if you want
to adapt yourself properly to life,</a>
00:09:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h09m33s">you should find a niche in the environment that corresponds with your temperament, right.</a>
00:09:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h09m37s">You shouldn't work at cross-purposes
to your temperament,</a>
00:09:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h09m40s">because it's just too damn difficult.</a>
00:09:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h09m42s">But having done that, then you should work on</a>
00:09:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h09m45s">developing the skills and viewpoints</a>
00:09:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h09m48s">that exist in the space opposite to your personality.</a>
00:09:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h09m51s">Because that's where you're
fundamentally underdeveloped.</a>
00:09:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h09m54s">Now, well, I think you can extend out your temperamental capability</a>
00:09:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h09m57s">across a wider range.</a>
00:09:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h09m59s">And to me that's roughly equivalent as
bringing a richer tool kit to each situation.</a>
00:09:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h10m04s">You know, so if you're hyper-extroverted, you should probably learn to shut up in parties now and then</a>
00:10:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h10m08s">and listen just to see what's going on, to
see if you can manage it, you know?</a>
00:10:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h10m12s">And if you're introverted, well,</a>
00:10:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h10m13s">then you should learn how to
speak in public, and to learn</a>
00:10:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h10m16s">how to go to parties without hiding in the corner</a>
00:10:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h10m18s">and saying nothing to anyone, you know?</a>
00:10:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h10m20s">And if you're agreeable, then you need to learn how to be disagreeable, so people can't push you around.</a>
00:10:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h10m25s">And if you're disagreeable, you need to learn how to be agreeable, so you're not an evil son of a b-</a>
00:10:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h10m30s">So, and the same thing applies even in the conscientious domain</a>
00:10:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h10m33s">It's like if you're too conscientious</a>
00:10:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h10m35s">you need to learn to relax and let go a little bit.</a>
00:10:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h10m39s">And if you're unconscientious it's time like</a>
00:10:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h10m42s">get out the Google Calendar, man,
and start scheduling your day, right?</a>
00:10:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h10m46s">And beat yourself on the back of the head with a stick until you're disciplined enough</a>
00:10:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h10m49s">so that you can actually stick to
something for some length of time.</a>
00:10:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h10m52s">And not living in absolute squalor,</a>
00:10:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h10m54s">which is something that would characterize someone who's very disorderly,</a>
00:10:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h10m57s">for example, 'cause they just, they don't notice.</a>
00:10:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h11m01s">It doesn't bother them, disorder.
It's like-</a>
00:11:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h11m04s">Maybe they can see it, but it doesn't have
any emotional valance.</a>
00:11:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h11m07s">so it doesn't have any motivational significance.</a>
00:11:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h11m10s">Now, so, the other thing you might wanna think
about too if you're choosing a partner is</a>
00:11:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h11m14s">try not to choose someone who's too distant from you</a>
00:11:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h11m17s">on the temperamental variables.</a>
00:11:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h11m19s">Because you're gonna have a hard time
bridging the gap, you know?</a>
00:11:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h11m22s">It's hard for an introverted person and
an extroverted person to coexist.</a>
00:11:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h11m26s">And it's really hard for an orderly person
and a disorderly person to coexist</a>
00:11:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h11m30s">'cause they will drive each other nuts.</a>
00:11:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h11m32s">"Why don't you pick up?"
"Why are you so obsessed by it?"</a>
00:11:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h11m35s">That's the basic argument, you know?</a>
00:11:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h11m37s">So, it's useful to know about your
temperament so that you</a>
00:11:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h11m40s">can negotiate a space with your partner,
and the other way as well.</a>
00:11:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h11m43s">And I don't think you should try to find
someone who's exactly the same as you.</a>
00:11:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h11m46s">Because then you don't have the benefits
of the alternative viewpoint.</a>
00:11:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h11m51s">But you gotta watch it, because you may hit irreconcilable differences of various sorts.</a>
00:11:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h11m56s">And I've seen that most particularly
among couples who are</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h11m59s">high and low in openness, that's a rough one.</a>
00:11:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di2FM8WZI5E#t=00h12m02s">And also high and low in conscientiousness,
that's another rough one.</a>
