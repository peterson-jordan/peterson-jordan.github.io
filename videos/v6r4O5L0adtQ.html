<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r4O5L0adtQ#t=00h00m21s">Because I've seen a lot of really terrible photographs, because I've done so much investigation into totalitarianism.</a>

That's what I would say - that's enlightening.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r4O5L0adtQ#t=00h01m38s">You know, because one of the things about enlightenment, is that...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r4O5L0adtQ#t=00h01m43s">...you get enlightened by doing things, that are necessary,</a>

00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r4O5L0adtQ#t=00h02m03s">It's a hell of a thing to swallow.</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r4O5L0adtQ#t=00h02m05s">You know, in a very well-structured society like ours, where we're so peaceful...</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r4O5L0adtQ#t=00h02m13s">Well, because we have the heat, and it always works,
and we have electricity, and it always works.</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r4O5L0adtQ#t=00h02m18s">And we have plumbing, which is a bloody miracle, and it always works!</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r4O5L0adtQ#t=00h02m25s">One of the things, that this imagination process has done for me is,</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r4O5L0adtQ#t=00h02m29s">keep me alert... to the absolute miracle,
that my life is every day.</a>
00:02:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r4O5L0adtQ#t=00h02m37s">It's horribly cold out there, you can't grow any food,
you die if you're out there for 24 hours.</a>
00:02:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r4O5L0adtQ#t=00h02m45s">If any of this infrastructure was unreliable for any length of time, we would be in serious trouble.</a>
00:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r4O5L0adtQ#t=00h02m51s">And it's never unreliable!</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r4O5L0adtQ#t=00h02m54s">It's so unlikely!</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r4O5L0adtQ#t=00h02m56s">And so, here we are, with all this reliable infrastructure.</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r4O5L0adtQ#t=00h03m00s">And because of that, we don't really have to compete with each other much.</a>
00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r4O5L0adtQ#t=00h03m04s">I mean, some.</a>
00:03:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r4O5L0adtQ#t=00h03m05s">You don't compete for food,
you don't compete for shelter.</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r4O5L0adtQ#t=00h03m08s">Or some people do,
but not very many.</a>
00:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r4O5L0adtQ#t=00h03m10s">So, it's really easy to think of yourself as good, because...</a>
00:03:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r4O5L0adtQ#t=00h03m16s">You're not doing anything nasty to anyone.</a>
00:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r4O5L0adtQ#t=00h03m19s">But, y'know, a cynic might say "well, that's just
because you don't have any reason to!"</a>
00:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r4O5L0adtQ#t=00h03m25s">But, those reasons have arisen many times in the past, and...</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r4O5L0adtQ#t=00h03m31s">In fact, they're the norm, not the exception.
W-we're the exception.</a>
00:03:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r4O5L0adtQ#t=00h03m34s">This insanely functional society,
that we somehow managed to generate, is...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r4O5L0adtQ#t=00h03m43s">It's incomprehensible to me, that it exists.</a>
