<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWgVpmo1e0#t=00h09m30s">decided to settle on surgery.

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWgVpmo1e0#t=00h09m44s">So I asked my doctor to increase

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWgVpmo1e0#t=00h10m20s">stopped taking them entirely and
tried ketamine, which is a</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWgVpmo1e0#t=00h10m28s">good ideas as it turned out. So</a>
00:10:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWgVpmo1e0#t=00h10m35s">I had to stop taking

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWgVpmo1e0#t=00h10m40s">In like the ketamine, oh, yeah.
Then I didn't go then I stayed</a>

what I knew about</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWgVpmo1e0#t=00h32m39s">should people take it? Well, and
then that's the next question is</a>
00:32:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWgVpmo1e0#t=00h32m42s">why should people take anything

00:33:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWgVpmo1e0#t=00h33m04s">I would say is, in my lectures

00:33:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWgVpmo1e0#t=00h33m18s">included myself in the

wasn't like I was when I was 17</a>
00:36:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWgVpmo1e0#t=00h36m20s">and had my ankle and hip done. I

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWgVpmo1e0#t=00h36m31s">I'm like, lots of people aren't

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWgVpmo1e0#t=00h36m40s">Yeah, and physical withdrawals
means your body gets used to the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWgVpmo1e0#t=00h36m52s">Yeah. So it's actually difficult

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWgVpmo1e0#t=00h37m15s">right. And so it took us five

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWgVpmo1e0#t=00h38m00s">That would have been terrible.

00:38:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWgVpmo1e0#t=00h38m04s">we get locked everywhere. And
