<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h01m23s">With their thinking so that they can come up with a plan to approach the world in a more confident way</a>
00:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h01m29s">So for example someone might come to me and say I'm being bullied badly at work, and so then I'll say well</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h01m35s">What are your options?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h01m36s">You have to put up with it. Well, we'll we'll figure that out because maybe you do maybe you don't have options</a>
00:01:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h01m41s">But here's how to find out get your damn CV together</a>
00:01:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h01m45s">So it's pristine right it's it's ready to go</a>

00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h01m54s">Job start thinking about what it would mean to have a different job</a>
00:01:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h01m58s">Start thinking about what it would mean to have a better job even because maybe your fear is just making you stuck here</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h02m04s">But I can tell you one thing if someone's picking on you at work, and you don't have options you lose</a>
00:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h02m10s">So you get the person to start building a strategy? It's like okay if you're going to tell this person</a>
00:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h02m15s">to stop</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h02m17s">you have to know how to make them stop and one and the one thing you need for sure is an option and if you</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h02m22s">Can't if you don't have an option then maybe we start thinking about the fact that you need some more training or something like that</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h02m28s">Because you cannot negotiate if you don't have any power</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h02m32s">So because while especially if you're dealing with someone who's really out to get you or really?</a>
00:02:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h02m37s">disagreeable</a>
00:02:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h02m38s">If you don't have a leg to stand on they'll just push you over and maybe they'll jump on YouTube because that's what they're like</a>
00:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h02m43s">and they enjoy it anyway, so it's no joke so</a>
00:02:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h02m47s">You put your options behind you and then you start to think about strategy?</a>
00:02:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h02m51s">So I tell people look if you're being harassed at work. You documented every time it happens, and you write it down</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h02m56s">So you've got like 20 stories about it, and it's fully documented and then you go confront the person at some point</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h03m02s">but with at least three pieces of evidence</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h03m04s">And you have some sense of what you tell them about what will happen if they don't stop</a>
00:03:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h03m10s">So you have to figure out? Well if they don't stop what are going to do about it?</a>
00:03:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h03m14s">Leave not if you can't leave so you have to be able to what does it wield a big stick and speak Softly</a>
00:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h03m22s">But you see that way, it's that's how you take your aggression. Which is an absolutely necessary part of your pSyChe and</a>
00:03:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h03m29s">manifest it up into a</a>
00:03:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h03m31s">Sophisticated means of dealing with the world you don't just suppress it you say well</a>
00:03:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h03m35s">I should be able to put up with it or I wish I wasn't so angry or something's like forget that that's</a>
00:03:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h03m41s">All it'll happen is your blood pressure will stay high and you'll die of a heart attack because anger for example is a very toxic</a>
00:03:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h03m47s">Emotion and it does cause heart damage over time</a>
00:03:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h03m50s">it's the only emotion that we really know that's being linked to things like cardiovascular risk and anger is is toxic because</a>
00:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h03m57s">It's like you're driving a car you you're stepping on the gas and pushing on the brake at the same time because anger</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h04m03s">Tells you to run away</a>
00:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h04m04s">and to attack at the same time because you don't know what's going to happen and so it it really amps up the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h04m11s">physiological demand on your body and so if you</a>
00:04:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h04m14s">including your heart and your musculature, so if you stay like that for like ten years you know you're going to aged 20 years and</a>
00:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-trgmm6jOE#t=00h04m22s">That's a bad plan</a>
