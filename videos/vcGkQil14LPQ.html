					<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h00m06s">Dr. Petersen, I mentioned those notions of responsibility, virtue and respect.</a>
00:00:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h00m12s">I think you spoke in detail about what you think students should not do</a>
00:00:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h00m17s">In such matters as iprotest and some kinds of political activities.</a>
00:00:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h00m20s">What advice would you like to give to students?</a>
00:00:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h00m24s">How can students make the change they want?</a>
00:00:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h00m29s">Of course. Read great books.</a>
00:00:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h00m31s">Oh really. You have four years that have been allocated from your life by society.</a>
00:00:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h00m37s">That gave you an identity worthy of pride. In addition to freedom.</a>
00:00:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h00m42s">And you will never get this again.</a>
00:00:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h00m46s">You have an identity that deserves respect. A university student and complete freedom attached to it.</a>
00:00:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h00m52s">And you have these giant libraries filled with the writing of very intelligent people.</a>
00:00:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h00m59s">And you know you can go to it and learn all these things.</a>
00:00:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h01m03s">And you may ask why you should learn it?</a>
00:01:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h01m05s">Learn it to get a job? Learn it to get high grades? You learn to get a university degree?</a>
00:01:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h01m10s">All this is nonsense!</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h01m12s">The reason you come to university to learn is that</a>
00:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h01m17s">Nothing is stronger than an intelligent person capable of thinking and expression. It's strength!</a>
00:01:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h01m21s">And I mean strength at its best. It's control, influence, respect and competition.</a>
00:01:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h01m27s">So you come to the university to strengthen your best skills.</a>
00:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h01m30s">And is to be strong talk.</a>
00:01:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h01m33s">Because if you have the ability to formulate your arguments, you are a winner in everything!</a>
00:01:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h01m39s">And because when you win in everything, everyone around you also wins.</a>
00:01:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h01m45s">Because converting yourself to something like a beacon means that you will spend the whole world.</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h01m55s">It is of course the best thing you can do.</a>
00:01:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h01m59s">But you should assume that you are coming to the university in order to get a job</a>
00:01:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h02m02s">Which is okay because it is much better than being without a job spending your time on video games.</a>
00:02:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h02m09s">I'm not against video games, by the way.</a>
00:02:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h02m17s">But it is not reason enough to exist in this world.</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h02m21s">This is what universities should call out for.</a>
00:02:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h02m24s">I know what Harvard students are like. I have been teaching here for five years.</a>
00:02:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h02m28s">You are so amazing! You are amazing.</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h02m31s">All of you can be the best people in the world.</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h02m35s">You are transforming yourselves into something prominent, meaningful, with historical roots and wise with knowledge.</a>
00:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h02m41s">You can do whatever you want. Which I hope is for good.</a>
00:02:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h02m45s">Because if you have a mind, all you want will be for good.</a>
00:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h02m49s">Because nothing has meaning and deserves attention and is also useful in facing life's misfortunes</a>
00:02:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h02m55s">More than confronting you with all your soul for good.</a>
00:02:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h03m00s">Unfortunately, universities have neglected this matter.</a>
00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h03m02s">This is why you see everyone disavow humanity. And they must because humanity has been corrupted.</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h03m07s">This is because we no longer teach the students these things. It is very clear.</a>
00:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h03m11s">Learn to think. Learn to talk. Learn to read.</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h03m16s">It makes you very powerful.</a>
00:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h03m21s">I don’t know why the students are not told this. It is not so difficult.</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h03m27s">Everyone wants to hear about this. "Can I really do this?"</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h03m31s">Yes, you can do it.</a>
00:03:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h03m34s">The entire community around you has struggled for thousands of years</a>
00:03:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h03m38s">In order to provide each of you with this wonderful opportunity that you have before your graduation and at your graduation.</a>
00:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h03m45s">Everyone is praying that you come here and see everything you can see.</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h03m51s">This is what you should do instead of brandishing signs saying that you are wronged.</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h03m58s">You see Yale students complaining that they are wronged.</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h04m02s">It makes me very anxious.</a>
00:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h04m05s">For example, "We are against the ruling class."</a>
00:04:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h04m07s">No, you are the children of the ruling class. You are still young.</a>
00:04:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h04m19s">The only reason why you are not rich is because you are still young.</a>
00:04:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h04m23s">If you look at the 1% of people with influence, you will see that most of them are very old.</a>
00:04:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h04m30s">Why? Because when you get old and reasonably successful you are exchanging your youth for wealth in the future.</a>
00:04:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h04m37s">But you will still be old in the end.</a>
00:04:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h04m39s">Are you going to barter? Are you exchanging your youth for this?</a>
00:04:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h04m44s">If you remove age from the economic equation, things are completely different.</a>
00:04:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h04m47s">Older people of course have more money. They have kept collecting it all their lives.</a>
00:04:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h04m51s">Is this unfair?</a>
00:04:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h04m54s">Of course it is fair unless you want to spend your life in complete poverty when you are in your seventieth year.</a>
00:04:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h04m59s">And you don't want this.</a>
00:04:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h05m02s">So I do not understand what happens to universities. I can't believe you are not told the first day you come</a>
00:05:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h05m10s">"You are on a heroic mission here. You have to take your capabilities to unimaginable levels in order to highlight yourselves."</a>
00:05:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h05m17s">"You will get out of here and no one can stop you."</a>
00:05:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h05m20s">"You will be able to do whatever you want."</a>
00:05:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h05m22s">That is why you are here. Instead, you are taught that the world is a place full of injustice and persecution, and that you are a victim.</a>
00:05:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h05m30s">And there is nothing you can do about it. Except for the re-dismantling of society ruled by men.</a>
00:05:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h05m36s">It is very pitiful. On universities, you feel ashamed that this is what students are being taught.</a>
00:05:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h05m43s">I am ashamed of it.</a>
00:05:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h05m45s">I have asked many parents about their reasons for making their children go to vocational colleges.</a>
00:05:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h05m50s">Because at least they are learning something useful. Something to say is too bad for someone like me.</a>
00:05:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h05m57s">Because I believe that getting the best education possible is the best thing for you and the community.</a>
00:05:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h06m04s">Why did the universities forget this?</a>
00:06:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h06m08s">It is postmodernism, modern Marxism, and a philosophy of resentment of everything and victimization.</a>
00:06:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkQil14LPQ#t=00h06m16s">Oh my God it's very pitiful.</a>
