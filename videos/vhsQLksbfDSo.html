00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h00m03s">because unfortunately, it's often the bully that gets the 
most respect in the schoolyard and even in the workplace.</a>
00:00:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h00m08s">But Jordan Peterson is an exemplar of a different way</a>
00:00:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h00m12s">to generate massive amounts of respect so in this video,</a>
00:00:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h00m15s">we're going to explore three main things that he does 
that force people to respect you without being a bully.</a>
00:00:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h00m21s">...but you can't force me to respect you; it's just not possible.</a>
00:00:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h00m24s">Okay, maybe not forced.</a>
00:00:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h00m25s">But perhaps make people much more likely to respect you so let's dive into it.</a>
00:00:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h00m30s">The first thing that Dr. Peterson does is called "pacing your reality."</a>
00:00:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h00m35s">So even when he doesn't share your beliefs, he shows that he 
can understand why you might think the things that you do.</a>
00:00:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h00m41s">For instance, Jordan is religious but listen to how he speaks about atheism.</a>
00:00:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h00m45s">There's a good case to be made for atheism.</a>
00:00:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h00m48s">I mean let's make no bones about it</a>
00:00:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h00m51s">because you could say in some sense, there's been 300-400 years</a>
00:00:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h00m55s">of brilliant scientists who've been doing nothing but laying the foundation for</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h00m59s">an objective empirical atheism.</a>
00:00:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h01m03s">Jordan grants that the side that he does not 
agree with has really strong points in his favor.</a>
00:01:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h01m08s">And this might sound counterproductive if you're trying to persuade 
someone but it actually makes people more open to changing their mind</a>
00:01:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h01m14s">because in any discussion, the absolute hardest thing to do</a>
00:01:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h01m18s">is to admit that you might be wrong and risk appearing dumb.</a>
00:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h01m22s">That's why sometimes saying things like, "Hey, you raise a great point,"</a>
00:01:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h01m25s">or "I totally see why you see things that way," is so 
important if you find yourself in a heated argument.</a>
00:01:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h01m30s">It lets the other person not feel dumb if they wind up changing their mind.</a>
00:01:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h01m35s">This is how Dr. Peterson can get people to open up 
to his views without having to push them around.</a>
00:01:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h01m41s">You can contrast that with the standard political discussion where two sides 
basically just yell their points of view at one another like in this clip.</a>
00:01:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h01m47s">If you work hard, if you get educated,</a>
00:01:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h01m51s">if you're an honest person — you can make it in America.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h01m54s">If you live in a neighborhood where people are poverty is endemic,</a>
00:01:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h01m58s">it's harder to work hard, it's harder to get an education— [Talks at the same time]</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h02m04s">No one changes their mind from a discussion like this so</a>
00:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h02m07s">even though it might be tempting to quote-unquote win an argument</a>
00:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h02m10s">by making really incisive points that make the other person look dumb, you have to</a>
00:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h02m13s">recognize that it actually makes them less likely to change their behavior</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h02m17s">if you don't also validate something about their position.</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h02m21s">Now, interestingly, Jordan peppers in many 
instances of mini-pacings into his normal speech.</a>
00:02:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h02m26s">For instance he mentions what you might be 
thinking while he's saying things. Just watch.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h02m31s">To those who have everything, more will be given; and 
from those who have nothing, everything will be taken.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h02m36s">It's really a vicious statement but what it means is</a>

00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h03m03s">Jordan will even raise a hypothetical question 
that you might have and then answer it.</a>
00:03:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h03m07s">...and the idea is that if you can do that you will transcend the tragedy</a>
00:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h03m11s">and it's like, "Well, could that be true?"</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h03m14s">Well, most people admire tough competent 
people so you know it's at least a little bit true.</a>
00:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h03m19s">What's especially fascinating is that once Dr. Peterson 
has completely reversed her initial position,</a>
00:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h03m24s">he's extra careful to not make you feel stupid about it.</a>
00:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h03m28s">The other person needs to be able to save face so 
he mentions one more time that he's not attacking.</a>
00:03:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h03m33s">I mean I get your point and I'm not trying to 
denigrate it in any sense; there's a complex issue here.</a>
00:03:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h03m38s">That's partially why so many people have had their minds changed by Dr. Peterson.</a>
00:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h03m42s">He's not trying to make them feel dumb; he's trying to help them, to educate them.</a>
00:03:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h03m46s">Contrast that with the quote-unquote "own" compilations on YouTube</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h03m50s">where one person tries to make the opposing side and 
the opposing argument seem as stupid as possible.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h04m24s">It can be tempting to laugh when your side 
gets one-up on someone from the other side</a>
00:04:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h04m28s">but when you make people feel stupid, nobody actually changes their mind</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h05m36s">It's a matter of facing the thing you least want to face</a>
00:05:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h05m39s">and there's this old story in King Arthur where 
the knights go off to look for the Holy Grail.</a>
00:05:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h05m46s">That's five different topics all in the span of just a few minutes</a>
00:05:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h05m49s">and you'll notice that they're all of interest to the listener.</a>
00:05:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h05m52s">First, you have that interesting fact about martial arts and then</a>
00:05:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h05m55s">he takes it to a larger historical context which everyone kind of understands</a>
00:05:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h05m58s">and then most importantly, he shows you how it applies to your life.</a>
00:05:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h06m02s">Two main points here — first is that winding nature of his speech</a>
00:06:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h06m06s">which keeps people on their toes and interested.</a>
00:06:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h06m09s">Now, you may have experienced someone who does this poorly</a>
00:06:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h06m12s">talking about every random thing that comes into 
their mind and completely losing your attention.</a>
00:06:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h06m16s">Peterson's approach works because he is constantly 
relating everything back to you — the listener.</a>
00:06:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h06m22s">Now, this focus on making things relevant to you is also the reason</a>
00:06:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h06m25s">that he switches to the second person in so many of his stories.</a>
00:06:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h06m29s">...you don't identify with either of those; you know that they're both necessary,</a>
00:06:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h06m32s">you know that you have to live with both of them, but you identify with</a>
00:06:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h06m37s">the capacity to continually transcend what you are.</a>
00:06:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h06m40s">So far, these are pretty common charisma traits</a>
00:06:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h06m43s">and you might have seen these before in some of our other breakdowns.</a>
00:06:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h06m45s">But there is one that is at least on our channel completely unique to 
Jordan and it's kind of his calling card — that is his use of archetypes.</a>
00:06:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h06m54s">The basic idea of an archetype is that it's an idea that resonates across</a>
00:06:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h06m58s">a wide swath of humanity despite differing conditions.</a>
00:06:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h07m02s">It's kind of like a foundational human story</a>
00:07:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h07m05s">so it's something that we intuitively understand, remember, and move towards.</a>
00:07:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h07m09s">Archetypes are often encapsulated in fairy tales and some of the most popular</a>
00:07:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h07m13s">stories of our age which is why you'll hear Petersen reference them all the time.</a>
00:07:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h07m17s">...that's the witch in Hansel and Gretel who fattens up the kids and eats them.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h07m40s">The point of using archetypal stories aside from being a fun way to reference</a>
00:07:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h07m43s">Disney movies is that they connect with people on a deep level.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h07m46s">They intuitively feel true and if you could relate a point 
that you're trying to make to an archetypal story,</a>
00:07:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h07m52s">you are going to be more persuasive.</a>
00:07:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h07m54s">That's actually how Peterson is able to take the 
unappealing advice of clean up your own room</a>
00:07:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h07m59s">and make it into a piece of advice that probably thousands of people have applied.</a>
00:07:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h08m03s">Now for those of you unfamiliar with his work, cleaning up your room</a>
00:08:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h08m06s">is meant literally but also to say that you need to clean up your own mess</a>
00:08:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h08m10s">before you go telling other people all the things that they need to fix for you.</a>
00:08:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h08m14s">It's really not appealing advice on the face of it which is why</a>
00:08:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h08m17s">so many of us ignored our mothers when they told us to do it.</a>
00:08:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h08m21s">But here is how Peterson leads into this advice.</a>
00:08:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h08m23s">You probably have all watched Pinocchio and Pinocchio is about how...</a>
00:08:23</p>

00:08:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h08m30s">beyond his comprehension but it's the situation of the undeveloped individual.</a>
00:08:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h08m34s">...Geppetto who's a benevolent father — so a benevolent symbol,</a>
00:08:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h08m39s">a symbol of benevolent culture, makes a puppet his son and then wishes on a star.</a>
00:08:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h08m44s">Now a star is something that glitters up in the sky 
and it's and it's associated with the transcend—</a>
00:08:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h08m49s">I can't grab all of this in one clip and that's kind of the point.</a>
00:08:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h08m52s">If Peterson had just told people, "Focus on yourself. First, 
clean up your room before you tell other people how to live,"</a>
00:08:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h08m57s">well, he'd have been about as effective as a motivational poster.</a>
00:08:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h09m01s">But in couching this advice inside of an archetypal story,</a>
00:09:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h09m04s">he makes it truly connect and actually changes people's lives.</a>
00:09:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h09m08s">That's why I think the ability to tell a good 
story is the most underrated charismatic trait.</a>
00:09:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h09m13s">If you can build the story in an archetypal structure, that's even better.</a>
00:09:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h09m17s">Now this is a big topic and one that I spend probably over an hour on</a>
00:09:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h09m21s">in Charisma University course but for now, I'm just going to link to a few storytelling</a>
00:09:21</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h09m28s">I do want to touch on one more point though.</a>
00:09:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h09m30s">And that's that Peterson can win respect without 
being a bully because he encourages dialogue.</a>
00:09:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h09m36s">Now one of the first clips that put him on the map and his most viewed to this date</a>

who do engage him without screaming.</a>

00:10:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h10m16s">if you want people to respect you and you don't want to do it in a domineering way,</a>
00:10:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h10m20s">you have to consider the other person, you consider their reality</a>
00:10:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsQLksbfDSo#t=00h10m24s">and you pace it in your speech; you consider their attention span</a>
