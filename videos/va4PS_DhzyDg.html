like that idea well here here's an</a>
00:08:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h08m49s">example so about twenty years ago I
would say there was a newspaper headline</a>
00:08:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h08m54s">in one accounted his major newspapers
and it was the Minister of Foreign</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h08m59s">Affairs at that time Lloyd Axworthy and
he was talking about what had happened</a>
00:08:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h09m02s">with Milosevic and in the former Soviet
Union in Yugoslavia and the atrocities</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h09m08s">that were being committed and he said
that he that he was caught unawares by</a>
00:09:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h09m12s">that because he didn't have the
imagination for that kind of evil and I</a>
00:09:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h09m17s">thought well you know you think that
what you're doing is signaling your</a>
00:09:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h09m21s">virtue by making a statement like that
but from my perspective all you're doing</a>
00:09:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h09m26s">is stating your cowardice and your
historical ignorance because if you're</a>
00:09:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h09m30s">gonna be Minister of Foreign Affairs you
bloody well better have imagination for</a>
00:09:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h09m33s">that kind of evil because if you don't
then anyone who does wins they beat you</a>
00:09:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h09m38s">and so you you know and again in the
Harry Potter stories you see he's</a>
00:09:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h09m43s">touched by evil right he actually has a
soul fragment that's embedded within him</a>
00:09:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h09m48s">that's as black as anything can possibly
be that's why he could talk to snakes</a>
00:09:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h09m53s">but without that he wouldn't be able to
have any victory and that's exactly</a>
00:09:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h09m57s">right psychologically unless you can
think the way that an evil person thinks</a>
00:09:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h10m02s">then you're defenseless against them

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h10m06s">imagine and then they win and so the
best man I've met I was interesting even</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h10m10s">when I was in junior high in high school

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h10m22s">I was like you know they're not doing
that anymore</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h10m26s">one of my friends got kicked out when he
sort of challenged the gym teacher you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h11m12s">you know you also see that like one of
the central mmm female stories let's say</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h13m40s">that's what I'm gonna do and my point in
giving this speech was he was a guy that</a>
00:13:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h13m44s">had learned how to fight he was a guy
that had been in combat and now there</a>
00:13:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h13m47s">was one more step to take which was okay

00:13:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h13m55s">dichotomy that that you talk about it
fits perfectly into the way I figured</a>
00:13:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h14m00s">out as a guy that went to high school
and joined the military it's kind of its</a>
00:14:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h14m06s">kind of raising but it reinforces what
you always say which is that there's</a>
00:14:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h14m09s">there's deeper meaning there's a reason
why I'm thinking that and the reason is</a>
00:14:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h14m13s">because I've because of the things that
you talk about the way these things are</a>
00:14:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h14m17s">overlaid throughout history for human
beings to have gotten to this point yeah</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h14m20s">well you acted it out you know which is
what you're supposed to do and it's also</a>
00:14:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h14m24s">it's better to act it out and to
understand it you know that's that's</a>
00:14:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h14m28s">best it's better it's better to

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h14m32s">not understand it at all but the best is
to act it out and understand it because</a>
00:14:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h14m37s">then you can you know then then the way
that you represent the world and</a>
00:14:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h14m40s">yourself is in accordance with the way
that you act and that's that's that's</a>
00:14:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h14m44s">optimized yeah and it's it's something
that I was kind of acting out again no</a>
00:14:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h14m49s">no real guys like my guidelines were
like I was raised in the SEAL Teams yeah</a>
00:14:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h14m53s">that was sort of my guidelines it and
here's a good example when I first got</a>
00:14:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h14m56s">in the SEAL Teams there's no war going
on so what did what did a good seal do</a>
00:14:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h15m00s">you know you did you went out and drank
and gotten bar fights mm-hmm that's what</a>
00:15:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h15m03s">a good seal did so you know what I did
went out drank gotten bar fights that's</a>
00:15:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h15m06s">what okay that's what I'm supposed to do
it took me a while to figure out no</a>
00:15:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h15m09s">there's actually something more than
that like we're actually supposed to be</a>
00:15:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h15m12s">preparing for war and and and so now
like you said I I definitely acted</a>
00:15:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h15m19s">things out and sort of was on a decent
path but as I got older and more mature</a>
00:15:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h15m23s">and to this day as I can look around and
actually overlay the understanding on</a>
00:15:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h15m28s">the way I've carried out my
is very it's very helpful to me and it's</a>
00:15:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h15m33s">also helps me explain it to other people
that see the path at home and go they</a>
00:15:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h15m37s">they like that path they would like to
join me on that path and I get guys that</a>
00:15:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h15m42s">you know when I was in I I you know I
kinda look like a serial killer for all</a>
00:15:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h15m47s">practical purposes I'm that's the way I
come across right nobody was not creepy</a>
00:15:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h15m52s">enough there's there's guys that would
you know guys that would work for me or</a>
00:15:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h15m59s">guys that would be around me and they'd
see me and they'd kind of latch on to</a>
00:15:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h16m02s">the fact that I was tough and aggressive
and and and some of those guys they</a>
00:16:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h16m06s">wouldn't catch the other part which was
that I was politically savvy and I was</a>
00:16:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h16m10s">working and I was maneuvering and I was
you know figuring things out and talking</a>
00:16:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h16m15s">to my boss in such a way that we could
get where we needed to be and I was</a>
00:16:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h16m18s">doing that whole other side and so I get
these guys that would end up not doing</a>
00:16:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h16m22s">as well as they should do because they
were just a jock was just ultra</a>
00:16:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h16m26s">aggressive and he gets after it and so
that's what I'm gonna do and I'll be in</a>
00:16:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h16m29s">the same place the guys that would do
well the guys that said oh yeah jock was</a>
00:16:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h16m32s">awesome and he's aggressive and he gets
after he's also working and he's also</a>
00:16:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h16m36s">maneuvering he's also massaging the egos
of the people around him so make sure</a>
00:16:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h16m40s">that they get in positioned in the right
spot where they can go to warp off in</a>
00:16:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h16m44s">the right way and and so as I've gotten
older I've been able to tell people that</a>
00:16:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h16m49s">more clearly like hey it's not just
about that side of the ultra-aggressive</a>
00:16:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h16m53s">but you got to be aggressive you got to
be willing to fight you got to be</a>
00:16:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h16m56s">willing to kill and you got to be
willing to die at the same time you got</a>
00:16:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h16m59s">to be able to tamper and temper all
those things in such a way that they can</a>
00:16:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h17m04s">be controlled and disciplined well I
also think that that's part of what</a>
00:17:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h17m07s">makes a world peaceful in the final
analysis because if you're around people</a>
00:17:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h17m12s">who are dangerous but disciplined then
everyone watches their step and that's</a>
00:17:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h17m18s">exactly what should happen everybody
should watch their step and if you do if</a>
00:17:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h17m23s">there's no reason for that then well
there's no there's no sanction for for</a>
00:17:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg#t=00h17m28s">poor behavior for example</a>
