<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h02m35s">Remaining in the zone of making music. So the music</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h02m52s">Nothing's new. Is it making this form of music and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h02m56s">Doing it in a hyper productive and powerful</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h02m59s">Fashion. Ok, so let's start with hyper productive</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h03m03s">So because you said you had twin</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h03m06s">Ambitions and so what's the hyper productive element? Well I've released. Is it five albums this year so far?</a>
00:03:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h03m15s">This year so far. We're in March. It's much</a>
00:03:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h03m20s">You mean since the beginning of 2019 indeed. Oh, yeah, ok</a>
00:03:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h03m25s">well that that seems to qualify as hyper productive, especially if this also happens to be a difficult endeavor it is it is but</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h03m33s">Here's the thing. I noticed I used to be a music journalist</a>
00:03:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h03m37s">and there's this phenomenon where in band's first albums are amazing and</a>
00:03:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h03m44s">Then their second albums are often not amazing</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h03m48s">Bunch of reasons for this but I figured the main thing is a band will be locked in a garage</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h03m54s">Playing together every day for years and years and years</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h03m58s">Writing songs together and so on and so forth and their first album will be the sum of that</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h04m02s">they'll have essentially been in a kind of flow and the first album will be the fruits of that flow and</a>
00:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h04m08s">Then the record company usually sends them on tour for a couple of years</a>
00:04:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h04m12s">at which point they fall out of that flow of writing songs all the time and</a>
00:04:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h04m16s">When they go back into the studio</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h04m19s">They've sort of fallen out of that zone</a>
00:04:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h04m22s">So I wondered to myself what would happen if one got in the zone and then refused to leave</a>
00:04:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h04m27s">Who if one just got in the state of just constantly?</a>
00:04:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h04m32s">creating with a very specific sort of mission and purpose and</a>
00:04:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h04m36s">And found a foundational sort of meaning behind it. So one doesn't get discouraged or whatever and</a>
00:04:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h04m43s">just kept doing that what would happen and I've been doing that since the February and</a>
00:04:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h04m49s">The results have been beyond what I could have</a>
00:04:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h04m53s">hoped for</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h04m54s">hmm and</a>
00:04:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h04m55s">Okay, the results being beyond what you could have hoped for along. What dimensions what's</a>
00:04:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h05m01s">What's changed for you over the last couple of years like what's this?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h05m13s">And well, let's also say personally</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h05m43s">however, previously if you kind of look at my catalog, you know, there would be many many years between releases and</a>
00:05:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h05m50s">The old model of the music industry, which I was I was sort of trapped in</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h06m11s">it's all about getting pressed and all these sorts of things and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSB7EL8VTmU#t=00h06m22s">and then I would go to sort of put it out and I wouldn't have all the resources that I</a>
