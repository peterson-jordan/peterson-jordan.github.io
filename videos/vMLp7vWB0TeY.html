<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h02m13s">You should do some thinking about what it is that you're talking about</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h02m55s">so I'm going to try to distinguish evil from tragedy by making some reference to the essential existential condition of human beings</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h03m30s">basis with the infinite and I believe that that fact is the reason why religious experience is essentially...</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h03m39s">And belief is essentially endemic to mankind, it's a human universal</a>
00:03:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h03m42s">and it's not because people believe, it's because</a>
00:03:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h03m46s">human existence as such consists of a confrontation between the finite and the infinite</a>
00:03:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h03m50s">and religious systems merely take that into account</a>
00:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h03m54s">Now our finitude in the face of the infinite has some inevitable consequences</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h03m59s">and I would say those consequences</a>
00:03:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h04m01s">are essentially the existential conditions of life. The first of those consequences is that</a>
00:04:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h04m06s">the finite is always overwhelmed by the infinite, it has to be because it can't encapsulate it and so what that means is that it's</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h04m14s">that suffering is central to the nature of human existence</a>
00:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h04m17s">and suffering exists as a consequence of the consequences of our limitations</a>
00:04:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h04m23s">I mean every single person who's alive is going to die</a>
00:04:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h04m27s">And every single person who's alive is going to deal with serious physical illness and mental distress</a>
00:04:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h04m33s">If they don't suffer, if they aren't suffering it directly, immediately, right now on their own</a>
00:04:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h04m37s">It's almost inevitably the case that every single person who walks the Earth</a>
00:04:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h04m41s">is confronting the bare bones of reality at that level in the guise of an afflicted family member</a>
00:04:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h04m48s">And so the fact of our finitude is again, no academic issue.</a>
00:04:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h04m53s">It's essential to the nature of our being and we're forced to deal with it on an ongoing basis</a>
00:04:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h04m58s">So I would say insufficiency is built into human experience and there are existential consequences to that</a>
00:04:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h05m06s">Now I read something a long time ago, and I don't remember who wrote it, but it was written about</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h38m59s">And every...  that's the case for every single person. You know, Solzhenitsyn said, drawing on his eastern orthodox christian background:</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h39m22s">The fact that it's here at all is hard to believe, the nature of it's hard to believe</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h39m26s">Everything that human beings does is so</a>
00:39:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h39m28s">ridiculous and remarkable that it's like it's a consistently and constantly unfolding miracle. The idea that each of you might be</a>
00:39:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h39m35s">a center of the cosmos, in that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h39m39s">infinite admixture of ridiculousness and absurdities, is hardly more than one more ridiculous thing to swallow</a>
00:39:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h39m48s">Well I'll summarize, I guess</a>
00:39:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h39m50s">I said that tragedy is a precondition for being</a>
00:39:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h39m55s">Being is the interplay between the finite and the infinite. And in that interplay there's tragedy. And there's no way out of that</a>
00:39:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h40m01s">Evil is something different</a>
00:40:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h40m04s">Evil is the conscious attempt to make the conditions of existence more pathological than they have to be. And it's motivated by conscious intent</a>
00:40:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h40m12s">The motivations arise because people pay a terrible price for their self conscious awareness</a>
00:40:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h40m17s">And that awareness is their awareness of their vulnerability. And that is a terrible thing to be aware of</a>
00:40:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h40m27s">That vulnerability can be confronted forthrightly, accepted, and the appropriate decisions made. Alternatively people can retreat into their own</a>
00:40:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h40m36s">rationalistic arrogance and attempt to deceive themselves and everyone else about the nature of their own existence and about the nature of reality</a>
00:40:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h40m44s">That Pathway leads to nothing but destruction</a>
00:40:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h40m49s">I think that there's good reason to assume that it's too late in the...</a>
00:40:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h40m53s">in our developmental course as a species for that path to be acceptable anymore</a>
00:40:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h40m57s">because we're too powerful, and if too many people stay on that path, we're going to do ourselves in</a>
00:40:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h41m03s">So I would say as we've become more technologically powerful, an increasing moral burden is being placed on each of us</a>
00:41:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h41m11s">It matters, to the destiny of the cosmos, whether or not you get your moral act straight</a>
00:41:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h41m18s">And I don't mean that in a trivial way</a>
00:41:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h41m21s">I believe that that's as close to an empirical fact as anything that can be demonstrated</a>
00:41:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h41m24s">And I also believe that's as terrifying a thing to consider as anything you could possibly imagine. And maybe it's too much to ask of people</a>
00:41:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h41m31s">But you know our great religious traditions do</a>
00:41:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h41m34s">continually remind us that inside every human being there's a spark of divinity. And that idea is a precondition</a>
00:41:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h41m40s">for our entire system of law</a>
00:41:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h41m44s">There's always the possibility that it's true</a>
00:41:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h41m46s">And if it's true it means that there is an infinite avenue of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h41m52s">potential that lays open to every single person. And that the ability</a>
00:41:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h41m57s">to transform the terrible conditions of reality into something, not only acceptable</a>
00:41:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLp7vWB0TeY#t=00h42m02s">but worthy of celebration, actually lies within our grasp</a>
