the fox and the cat,</a>
00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h00m06s">I think this one's based on
one of the Marx Brothers actually,</a>
00:00:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h00m08s">Harpo Marx,
who I believe never said anything,</a>
00:00:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h00m11s">But, be that as it may,
they're these ne'er-do-well characters,</a>
00:00:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h00m15s">the fox in particular.</a>
00:00:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h00m16s">Now, a fox is a standard trickster animal,</a>
00:00:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h00m22s">it's a classic animal,</a>
00:00:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h00m23s">maybe because it's good at hiding
and it's good at hunting,</a>
00:00:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h00m27s">I don't know exactly why,
and coyotes are like that too</a>
00:00:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h00m31s">They're classic trickster animals.</a>
00:00:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h00m34s">He's like Wile E. Coyote in fact,
the Warner Brothers character</a>
00:00:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h00m39s">whose genius at large and
whose arrogance continually get him walloped,</a>
00:00:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h00m45s">this character has a lot of features like that,
but he feigns being an English gentleman,</a>
00:00:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h00m51s">of, like, the 1890s,
and he pretends to be educated,</a>
00:00:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h00m54s">and he has that high-blown way of talking,
and he's a fraud through and through,</a>
00:00:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h00m59s">he's got this sidekick,
who is barely there at all,</a>
00:00:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h01m06s">and he doesn't treat him that well,
but he's got someone to lord it over,</a>
00:01:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h01m11s">so that keeps
his dominance-hierarchy thing going well,</a>
00:01:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h01m13s">the fact that he's a second-rate companion,
he never really notices that.</a>
00:01:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h01m19s">although he'll treat him contemptuously
whenever he gets the chance.</a>
00:01:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h01m21s">So anyways,
they're walking down the street,</a>
00:01:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h01m24s">and the fox is bragging away about
some crooked thing that he's done,</a>
00:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h01m28s">how he pulled the wool
over someone's eyes.</a>
00:01:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h01m31s">He confuses that with wisdom and intelligence,
and one of the things that you see:</a>
00:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h01m36s">this is worth knowing too, because...</a>
00:01:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h01m38s">...if you're preyed upon by a psychopath,</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h01m41s">which you will be to some degree
at some point in your life,</a>
00:01:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h01m44s">the psychopath, who will be narcissistic,
will presume that you're stupid,</a>
00:01:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h01m49s">and that you deserve to be taken advantage of,
because you're naïve and stupid,</a>
00:01:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h01m53s">so it's actually a good thing
that he's doing it.</a>
00:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h01m57s">His proof-and I'm saying "he"
because there are more male psychopaths-</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h02m04s">the proof that you're stupid and naïve
is that he can take advantage of you.</a>
00:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h02m08s">If you were wiser,
you'd know his tricks,</a>
00:02:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h02m11s">and it wouldn't be morally necessary</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h02m14s">to show you just
who knows what about what.</a>
00:02:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h02m18s">And so the psychopath will use
his ability to fool you</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h02m23s">as proof of his own grandiose omnipotence,
omniscience and narcissism.</a>
00:02:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h02m29s">And the problem with that
is that you can be fooled by a psychopath.</a>
00:02:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h02m33s">Virtually anybody can.</a>
00:02:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h02m35s">So that Robert Hare, for example,
who studied psychopaths for a long time,</a>
00:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h02m39s">and interviewed a lot of them,</a>
00:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h02m40s">like hundreds of them,</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h02m42s">and videotaped
many of the interviews,</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h02m44s">he said when he talked to the psychopath
he always believed what they said,</a>
00:02:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h02m47s">and then he'd watch the video after
and see where the conversation went off the rails,</a>
00:02:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h02m52s">but the proclivity to be polite
in a conversation is very strong,</a>
00:02:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h02m59s">and if you're polite, you don't object to how
the person unfolds their strategy,</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h03m05s">and psychopaths are pretty good at figuring out
how to manipulate people</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h03m11s">the probability that you will be immune to that
is extraordinarily low.</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h03m15s">Go watch Paul Bernardo being interviewed
by policemen on YouTube.</a>
00:03:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h03m19s">That's bloody...
that's enlightening, man.</a>
00:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h03m22s">Paul Bernardo, he's like the CEO
of a meeting in that video.</a>
00:03:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h03m26s">He gives the cops hell,
he gives the lawyers hell,</a>
00:03:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h03m28s">he protests his innocence,</a>
00:03:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h03m30s">he basically tells them
that they're rude and untrustworthy,</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h03m34s">because they don't trust him
because of a few little things seventeen years ago.</a>
00:03:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h03m38s">And he gets away with it!
"A few little things", right,</a>
00:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h03m40s">I mean, he killed a bunch of people,
including the sister of his then-girlfriend,</a>
00:03:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h03m46s">he was a repeat sexual offender and murderer,
but he basically goes:</a>
00:03:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h03m49s">"Well, you know, that's a long time ago!
We're past that, aren't we?</a>
00:03:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h03m55s">I mean, I'm having a discussion with you,
I'm trying to help you solve the crimes,</a>
00:03:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h03m58s">which, by the way, I committed,
but we won't bring that up,</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h04m01s">and you're accusing me of being a liar!
You're not playing fair, what's up with you?"</a>
00:04:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h04m07s">And then when they answer,
he just looks at his fingernails,</a>
00:04:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h04m10s">that's a lovely little manipulative thing,
because it basically means:</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h04m13s">"whatever happens to be under my fingernail
at the moment is much higher priority</a>
00:04:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h04m17s">than listening to your foolish story".
And you watch,</a>
00:04:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h04m20s">you'll see people do that to you,
and you get an insight into what they're up to.</a>
00:04:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h04m24s">He's very good at that.
Or he looks outside,</a>
00:04:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h04m27s">or he looks at his hands,
or he looks out the window,</a>
00:04:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h04m30s">immediately dismissive
in his non-verbal behaviour.</a>
00:04:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h04m33s">It's brilliant.</a>
00:04:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h04m34s">The courts were forced to release that,
by the way,</a>
00:04:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h04m38s">look it up,
Paul Bernardo on YouTube,</a>
00:04:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h04m42s">it's just mind-boggling.
He's so good at what he does.</a>
00:04:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h04m45s">And he's good-looking,
and he's charismatic,</a>
00:04:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h04m48s">he can really pull it off.</a>
00:04:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h04m50s">You can't tell
what's happening with the cops and the lawyers,</a>
00:04:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h04m52s">whether they're letting him play his routine

00:04:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h04m56s">or if actually
he's setting them back on his heels,</a>
00:04:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h04m58s">and I suspect
it's a bit of both,</a>
00:04:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h05m02s">but it's a masterful performance.</a>
00:05:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h05m03s">If you didn't know

00:05:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h05m05s">and you were watching it

00:05:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djEKllJJukk#t=00h05m07s">you'd think
