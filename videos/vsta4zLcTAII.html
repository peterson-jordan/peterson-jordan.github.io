00:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h01m25s">the things that I do methodologically to protect

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h01m31s">So there is this idea in psychology called
the multimethod-multitrait method of construct</a>
00:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h01m39s">validation, which is, you know, a God-awful
agglomeration of jargon. But it actually means</a>
00:01:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h01m46s">something. And it was the construction of
two psychologists back in the late 1950s,</a>
00:01:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h01m53s">Cronbach and Meehl, who were interested in
what psychologists meant when they said something</a>
00:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h01m58s">existed. Like say, anger. Is that a real thing?
Well what do you mean, ‘thing’? What is</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h02m05s">it that you’re talking about? What is anger,
exactly? I don’t mean as ‘anger’, but</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h02m09s">as an idea. What sort of idea is the idea
of anger or the idea of anxiety or the idea</a>
00:02:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h02m15s">of sadness? Or the idea of self-esteem or
self-competence or any of these things that</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h02m20s">psychologists talk about as if they’re realities.
Well, some realities are very tangible, right,</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h02m27s">and it’s somewhat easy to come to agreement
about the contours of their existence, and</a>
00:02:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h02m33s">the borders, but other things are way more
difficult than that. And so their idea was</a>
00:02:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h02m39s">that if something actually existed, you should
be able to measure it multiple ways, using</a>
00:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h02m44s">multiple techniques, and still get the same
answer. And so, your senses do that. You have</a>
00:02:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h02m51s">five of them. And the reason you have five,
apparently, is because evolution has determined</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h02m55s">that if you only had four you’d die more
often. So it seems as if you have five separate</a>
00:02:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h03m00s">sources of information that all lead to the
same conclusion. You can be relatively certain</a>
00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h03m07s">that the conclusion’s that reached is real.
Well, the multimethod-multitrait method is</a>
00:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h03m14s">an application of that idea to construct validation,
which is like… you could think of anger</a>
00:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h03m20s">as an idea, as a construct, it’s a terminological
issue. You just define it as a construct,</a>
00:03:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h03m26s">a psychological construct. How do you know
if they’re real? Well the idea is it’s</a>
00:03:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h03m31s">very complicated. You have to measure them
in multiple ways. All the ways you measure</a>
00:03:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h03m35s">them have to give the same reading. Then you
have to show that that idea is the same in</a>
00:03:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h03m42s">certain ways as other ideas that it’s related
to and different from other ideas that it’s</a>
00:03:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h03m47s">not related. So let me give an example. There’s
a construct: ‘neuroticism’. And you might</a>
00:03:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h03m54s">say, well there’s another construct: ‘depression’.
Well then you might say, “well are those</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h04m00s">separate or are they the same?” Well that’s
a tough one, because in many, many ways they’re</a>
00:04:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h04m07s">the same. Are they different in any important
ways? Well, the way you do that technically</a>
00:04:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h04m13s">is you would measure neuroticism however you
were going to measure it. Maybe I’d have</a>
00:04:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h04m18s">you tell me how neurotic you were using a
questionnaire, and then I’d have your friend</a>
00:04:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h04m22s">tell me and maybe your parent, so we’ve
got a pretty good triangulation on your neuroticism.</a>
00:04:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h04m27s">Then I have them do the same thing, all those
people do the same thing with regards to your</a>
00:04:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h04m32s">levels of depression and anxiety. Then I’d
use both those measures to predict something</a>
00:04:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h04m38s">else, like how well your life goes in terms
of career over the next ten years. And if</a>
00:04:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h04m47s">neuroticism predicted and depression predicted,
so they were correlated, then I’d think</a>
00:04:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h04m51s">well there’s some relationship. Then I’d
look at them at the same time. If I predict</a>
00:04:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h04m56s">with neuroticism and then I add depression
to the mix, does that give me more predictive</a>
00:04:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h05m03s">power. It’s sort of like does A = C or does
A + B = C? That’s all you’re asking in</a>
00:05:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h05m10s">a regression equation, roughly speaking. Well
if A = C is just as good as A + B = C, especially</a>
00:05:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h05m18s">if the two things are also correlated (depression/anxiety
and neuroticism are going to be very highly</a>
00:05:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h05m24s">correlated, like 0.7, something like that),
you might say well those are the same things.</a>
00:05:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h05m29s">Just because they have different names, it’s
not helped. And part of it is, it’s a pragmatic</a>
00:05:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h05m35s">conceptualisation of reality, it’s like,
is this categorisation structure good for</a>
00:05:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h05m41s">something?
Okay, so anyways, I’ll unpack all that and</a>
00:05:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h05m45s">say, well part of my rules for determining
whether these things were useful or not was</a>
00:05:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h05m50s">to see if the ideas apply across multiple
levels of analysis. So that’s why I told</a>
00:05:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h05m55s">you about the conceptual, so that’s sort
of the cognitive psychology, and then the</a>
00:05:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h05m59s">neuropsychological, so there’s some input
of brain research. And then the narrative</a>
00:05:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h06m07s">or mythological, and then the cross-cultural
and think well those all stack up in a certain</a>
00:06:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h06m12s">way so that if you look between all of them
you can see a pattern. And it seems to me</a>
00:06:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h06m17s">increasingly unlikely that that pattern would
be there across all of those levels at the</a>
00:06:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h06m23s">same time. Now you could say well, you know
that depends on how good you are at weaving</a>
00:06:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h06m29s">a story. But at some point, encapsulating
that many phenomena and weaving a coherent</a>
00:06:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h06m38s">story out of them if such a thing doesn’t
exist, it seems to me to become cognitively</a>
00:06:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h06m44s">impossible. You just can’t do it unless
there’s actually something there. And of</a>
00:06:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h06m50s">course everything I tell you also is a simplification.
It has to be. Because you could spend your</a>
00:06:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h06m55s">whole life investigating any of the things
we’re talking about and so what I’m hoping</a>
00:06:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h06m59s">is I’ve extracted out the central issues
of these multiple levels of analysis and put</a>
00:06:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h07m06s">together, each of them support all the others.
Anyways, who knows? You know, I don’t know,</a>
00:07:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h07m15s">but so far so good. Okay so this is a cool
representation, I really like this one. This</a>
00:07:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h07m21s">is called The Open Virgin. And it’s a 14th
or 13th century sculpture, if I remember correctly.</a>
00:07:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h07m27s">It’s made out of wood. And these things

that had different exemplars. You could find</a>
00:07:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h07m39s">different ones of them online. This is brilliant,
this bloody thing, as far as I’m concerned.</a>
00:07:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h07m44s">So let me show you this figure again. So basically
what you have here, in this figure, this is</a>
00:07:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h07m52s">a world conception. And the world conception
is roughly: there’s an individual, positive</a>
00:07:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h07m58s">and negative, he or she is in a cultural sphere
that’s positive or negative, that’s embedded</a>
00:07:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h08m05s">in the world outside of culture, that’s
positive and negative, and all of it comes</a>
00:08:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h08m09s">from potential. That’s the idea.
Now, this map shows all of the positives and</a>
00:08:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h08m18s">negatives in relationship to one another,
and you see it’s not perfectly symmetrical</a>
00:08:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h08m22s">and the reason for that is, as far as I can
tell, the adversarial element of the individual</a>
00:08:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h08m27s">is the thing that generates the tyrannical
element of culture. And that’s the thing</a>
00:08:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h08m32s">that gets in your way of establishing a creative
relationship with what you don’t know. Well,</a>
00:08:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h08m41s">anyways. Here is a manifestation of that,
I believe. And I like this manifestation because…</a>
00:08:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h08m51s">like, it’s obviously Christian, but not
exactly. It’s more mythological than Christian.</a>
00:08:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h08m58s">And the reason for that, well, is quite obvious.
So the superordinate figure is Mary, the feminine.</a>
00:08:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h09m08s">Now you think, well it’s amazing the person
who carved this didn’t get burnt up at the</a>

but it’s just an indication of how the mythology</a>
00:09:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h09m18s">can change the causal relationship between
these different elements.</a>
00:09:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h09m22s">So you have Mary there, she’s the ultimate
in femininity, the ultimate feminine deity,</a>
00:09:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h09m29s">but only the positive side. And then within
her, so it’s like Nature opens itself up,</a>
00:09:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h09m37s">benevolent Nature opens itself up, and what
you see inside is culture, that’s God the</a>

in this case is the crucified Christ, which</a>
00:09:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h09m50s">is a wonderful conceptualisation as far as
I’m concerned, because of course that is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h09m54s">what life does to people, that’s why that’s
such a powerful symbol. It’s like, you know,</a>
00:09:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h10m00s">Christ is the person who has to face the reality

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h10m21s">in principle, transcends them. Well it’s

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h10m24s">otherwise, well what’s going to happen?
You’re done if you don’t do that. And</a>
00:10:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h10m29s">it’s even worse, it’s not only that you

So you know, if you’re suffering and you</a>
00:10:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h10m48s">can’t cope with it, generally speaking what
happens is that it embitters you. And once</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h11m01s">that can just get completely out of hand.
Now that’s a quick trip to the worst suburb</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h11m07s">of the Underworld, that’s for sure. So you
know, it’s not only that if you don’t</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h11m24s">to make everything even more tragic than it
has to be. And so I think that’s why in</a>
00:11:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h11m30s">medieval Christian conceptualisations in particular,
the idea of hell, the idea that you were destined</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h11m38s">to hell was worse than the idea of dying.
And it’s a strange idea, you know, because</a>
00:11:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h11m43s">you think (this is what the terror management

00:11:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h12m05s">difficult to understand that there are some

00:12:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h12m25s">Okay so that’s pretty interesting. So you’ve
got the superordinate feminine figure here,</a>
00:12:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h12m30s">which is not what you would expect from a

00:12:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h12m38s">would also be a valid representation. Because
you can think of the mother as something that’s</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h12m45s">protected by the culture. And supporting the
individual, because that’s basically what</a>
00:12:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h12m50s">this representation shows. But then you see
on the open sides, I really like this, I think</a>
00:12:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h12m56s">it’s so cool, is that you’ve got all these
people who aren’t archetypal figures, they’re</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h13m01s">in a little crowd. And they’re gazing at
the central figure. And of course that’s</a>
00:13:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h13m06s">exactly what’s happened in Christianity
for two thousand years, right, insofar as</a>
00:13:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h13m09s">it has spread, is that for two thousand years
people have been looking at that image, which</a>
00:13:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h13m14s">is the crucifixion, transfixed by it. Well
why? Well, you know, for reasons that we don’t</a>
00:13:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h13m23s">understand. When everybody woke up in the
late 1800s and said, “why were we looking</a>
00:13:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h13m29s">at that for the last two thousand years?”
the first answer was “well we really don’t</a>
00:13:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h13m34s">have the foggiest idea”. It was just one
of the things that we did, roughly speaking.</a>
00:13:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h13m39s">It encapsulated people within the belief system.
So that’s another good example, anyway,</a>
00:13:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h13m45s">of how this archetypal imagery can manifest
itself, say spontaneously, in the imagination</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h13m50s">of an artist. And the thing is, that’s a
sacred image. And it is an actuality, that’s</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h13m57s">what it is. What it shows is, well there’s
a superordinate, transcendent, natural order</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h14m04s">that has a beneficial element that we associate
with femininity, and inside that there’s</a>
00:14:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h14m09s">a supportive culture that’s properly nested
if things are organised properly. And it’s</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h14m14s">both of those things that provide support
for the suffering individuals. It’s like</a>
00:14:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h14m19s">yeah, that’s pretty much got it. Now that
doesn’t exhaust the meaning of this particular</a>
00:14:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h14m26s">representation, there’s a lot more to it
than that, but just that is not so bad.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h23m25s">you know, you should be at least appropriately

00:23:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h23m47s">there are myths that describe that quite directly.

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h25m58s">that is that if you don’t know how to live
then things fall apart. And that’s not good.</a>
00:25:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h26m04s">And they can really fall apart, you know,
and part of the reason I think that this became</a>
00:26:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h26m09s">so much of an obsession for me is that I believe
that we don’t have a lottery of… we are</a>

the consequence of our blindness is reaching</a>
00:26:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h26m29s">uncontrollable proportions. If you’re weak
and stupid, well you know, there’s only</a>
00:26:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h26m33s">so much damage you can do. But we’re not
weak, not at all. We have unbelievable power</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h26m40s">at our disposal now, and a lot of weird things
are going to come down the pipes in the next</a>

The more people that have their act together,</a>
00:26:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h26m52s">the better. Because then things will be tilted
towards everything lining up in a positive</a>
00:26:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h27m00s">direction rather than being tilted in the
other direction. And that’s important. And</a>
00:27:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h27m05s">I think people can make a very powerful individual
contribution to that, wherever you happen</a>
00:27:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h27m10s">to be. You know, all of these myths always
say the same thing. They say that the future</a>

And I think that’s literally true. So then</a>
00:27:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h27m31s">you might think, well you better put yourself
in a position where you make wise choices,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta4zLcTAII#t=00h27m35s">because if you don’t… we’ve already
