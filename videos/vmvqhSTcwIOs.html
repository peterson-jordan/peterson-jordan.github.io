<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h00m17s">Rogers is one of those optimists you really have to contend with.</a>

00:00:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h00m22s">he believed, and I think this is a classical Protestants believe this as well... that what evil was, was basically the absence of good</a>
00:00:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h00m31s">and that people had a strong</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h00m41s">the preconditions for the emergence of that good. And he believed that.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h00m46s">The preconditions were</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h01m07s">Here's the Rogerian theory with regards to therapeutic endeavor</a>
00:01:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h01m14s">Now the first thing is, and this seems critical,</a>
00:01:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h01m17s">and I think Rogers was right about this, that the client has to want to change.</a>
00:01:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h01m23s">And this is this is a funny thing about therapy because my observation has been that</a>
00:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h01m29s">It's not something you can impose on people</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h01m32s">Unless they've decided that things could be better and that alterations in in in something they're doing might make it better</a>
00:01:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h01m40s">It's a non-starter, and so I've had clients who were court-ordered to attend therapy</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h01m45s">and that's just complete waste of time especially if they're more on the psychopathic end of things because you just</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h01m52s">If they don't want to change they're not going to learn. This is actually another criterion principle and</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h01m57s">Because Rogers had an educational philosophy as well and the educational philosophy was</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h02m03s">students will not learn things that are not relevant to them</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h02m06s">and so one of the teachers duties was to make the material at hand relevant because that would</a>
00:02:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h02m14s">Help the student</a>
00:02:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h02m16s">Remember it why I remembered if it's not relevance one of the things I tried to do in my lectures</a>
00:02:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h02m20s">I try to tell people</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h02m21s">when I'm lecturing why they should know this and the</a>
00:02:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h02m24s">Fundamental answer always if you push it down far enough is that if you know this</a>
00:02:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h02m29s">Your life will go better and so will the life of people around you</a>
00:02:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h02m32s">so you should listen because then there's some things that are sharp and pointy that you won't run into while you're wandering around in the</a>
00:02:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h02m39s">fog</a>
00:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h02m40s">So and that's the fundamental issue. It's necessary to know these things and so</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h02m45s">if you're dealing with someone who hasn't decided that there's something wrong and that they have something to do about it then that maybe they</a>
00:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h02m51s">Could change and that would make things better</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h02m54s">you're not going anywhere and</a>
00:02:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h02m56s">Rogers would also say that's actually precondition for a relationship period</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h03m01s">because he didn't really make much of a distinction between a therapeutic relationship and a</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h03m06s">genuine relationship because he thought that genuine relationships were therapeutic and so one of the</a>
00:03:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h03m12s">Principles that you can extract from that is that if you're in a relationship?</a>
00:03:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h03m18s">One useful</a>
00:03:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h03m19s">Proposition is that well you're pretty perfect</a>
00:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h03m22s">But you're probably not quite as perfect as you could be and so it's possible that your partner</a>
00:03:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h03m27s">No matter how deeply flawed they are might now, and then have something to say to you</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h03m32s">That would if you incorporate it would bring you to an even higher state of profession right and so</a>
00:03:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h03m38s">That's that means you have to listen and it's worse than that and this again is a Rogerian</a>
00:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h03m45s">Observation you might have to help them criticize you because maybe they're not very good at it</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h03m51s">You know and so there's something there trying to tell you in there's stumbling way, and it's it's an actual thing</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h03m58s">But they can't articulate it and so it'd be easy for you</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h04m01s">Just to especially if you're trying to use languages to mentally and to get away with it just to well you could even make fun</a>
00:04:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h04m07s">of the way, they're</a>
00:04:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h04m09s">Poorly articulating the problem, that's a really good one because then you can convince them not to do such things in the future</a>
00:04:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h04m15s">but if you take the other stance which is</a>
00:04:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h04m17s">Well, I've got some things to learn and you've got some things to learn and you've got some things to teach me and I've got</a>
00:04:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h04m22s">Some things to teach you and god only knows when that's happen</a>
00:04:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h04m25s">But it might happen so the object of the conversation is for each person help the other person make their point</a>
00:04:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h04m32s">You know and that's a lot different than winning the argument and I can tell you one thing</a>
00:04:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h04m36s">You will not win an argument with any intimate partner ever</a>
00:04:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h04m40s">because you're not playing the game of the argument you're playing the game of iterated arguments across time and</a>
00:04:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h04m46s">So if you win an argument you just set up another one</a>
00:04:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h04m51s">Winning and solving the problem aren't the same thing so from a Rotarian perspective winning would be the maintenance of your current self structure</a>
00:04:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h04m58s">At the cost of failure to integrate some disk integrated element of the phenomenological realm</a>
00:04:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h05m06s">Maybe it'd be the unhappiness of your partner that might be one of them now you can if you win the argument</a>
00:05:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h05m11s">that's the rationalization issues fundamentally you don't have to change but the</a>
00:05:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h05m16s">Fact is you do have to change because?</a>
00:05:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h05m19s">The way you are is giving rise to this situation and that's not gonna change unless you fix it so winning an argument</a>
00:05:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h05m26s">fixing something those are completely different things you fix the thing it goes away and</a>
00:05:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h05m31s">Often you know couples have to have</a>
00:05:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h05m34s">Conflict because there's no difference between conflict and thinking thinking is a form of war</a>
00:05:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h05m40s">It's just that you and you make it an interior form of war right you can't have a couple with conflict because life is different</a>
00:05:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h05m47s">Difficult and people differ from one another so they have different value structures</a>
00:05:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h05m52s">And so you can't just ignore that you have to set up a dialogue because it's not necessarily obvious who's right of course</a>
00:05:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h05m58s">We're all just bleed that therapeutic realm - so he thought of therapy as something that</a>
00:05:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h06m03s">Emerged as a consequence of the adoption of certain axiomatic presuppositions and those were</a>
00:06:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h06m10s">Things could be better than they are and you could make them that way and that's also true for me</a>
00:06:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h06m16s">And then the next presumption is well. Maybe we can figure out how to do that in a collaborative</a>
00:06:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h06m22s">with collaborative communication</a>
00:06:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h06m25s">So Rogers believed that</a>
00:06:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h06m27s">The therapist was just as transformed during the therapeutic process as the person in fact if that wasn't happening then</a>
00:06:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h06m34s">Whatever was happening wasn't the kind healing therapy that Rogers would like to have happen, and he also said</a>
00:06:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h06m41s">That's I'll read you something. He said later, but he also pointed out quite</a>
00:06:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h06m45s">Strongly that that's why people don't really like to listen. You know like maybe there's some flaw in your self structure at some fundamental level</a>
00:06:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvqhSTcwIOs#t=00h06m53s">Fundamentally axiomatic level you know maybe your narcissistic that'd be a good one and you know</a>
00:06:53</p>
