on Youtube, it seems that we love to watch</a>
00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h00m04s">people have meltdowns when they’re verbally
bested.</a>
00:00:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h00m07s">Now we normally consider the person who did
the destroying to be the winner of those interactions.</a>
00:00:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h00m11s">But there is different take which I want to
examine today in this video.</a>
00:00:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h00m14s">And we’re going to be using Jordan Peterson
in his recent conversations with Sam Harris</a>
00:00:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h00m18s">as an example.</a>
00:00:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h00m19s">Now here is the problem in his own words,
Jordan: “you’re going to have contentious</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h00m23s">discussions about how to move forward, and
it’s very frequently the case that your</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h00m27s">words will be--that you’ll be straw-manned,
your words will be taken out of context, the</a>
00:00:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h00m32s">other person, and you too, will try to win instead
of trying to solve the problem”.</a>
00:00:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h00m36s">Winning an argument and even destroying the
other person isn’t the same as solving the</a>
00:00:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h00m40s">problem.</a>
00:00:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h00m41s">Worse, winning an argument can damage the
relationship if it isn’t done with tact.</a>
00:00:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h00m45s">So in this video, we’re going to look at
five tips from Dr. Peterson on how you can</a>
00:00:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h00m48s">win arguments without either person having
to get destroyed.</a>
00:00:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h00m51s">Now to be clear, there are times when Jordan
is going to be more aggressive or defensive,</a>
00:00:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h00m56s">and maybe I will do another video on those
type of point scoring debates if that’s</a>
00:00:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h01m00s">something you’re interested in.</a>
00:01:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h01m01s">But for now, the first tip that you need to
know is that you should begin most disagreements</a>
00:01:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h01m06s">by delineating not where you differ, but where
you agree.</a>
00:01:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h01m09s">Which is where Jordon started in his discussion
with Sam Harris in Vancouver, Jordan: “I</a>
00:01:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h01m13s">thought what I might do, is just lay out some
places that I think Sam and I agree and because</a>
00:01:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h01m18s">there’s lots of places we agree.”</a>
00:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h01m20s">And in this next clip and you’re going to
see concretely how calling out areas of agreement</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h01m24s">can make someone more open to alternate viewpoints,
for context the student who’s asking the</a>
00:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h01m29s">question is pointing out what he perceives
to be a potential hole in Jordan Peterson’s</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h01m33s">argument against hate speech laws.</a>
00:01:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h01m35s">Watch how Jordon responds and notice how the
student begins to nod, Student: “Feel as</a>
00:01:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h01m40s">if they can’t really engage in retaliatory
you know clarificatory discourse against them</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h01m44s">because they fear the potential repercussions,
even if they don’t lead to violence, they</a>
00:01:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h01m48s">just fear it so much that it might irrationally
or rationally even drive them”, Jordan:</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h01m52s">”Oh it happens, it happens all the time!</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h01m54s">In fact, it’s the standard situation, you
know if you look across the world…”</a>
00:01:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h02m01s">Essentially Peterson spends the next two minutes
agreeing and expanding on the student’s</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h02m05s">point.</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h02m06s">Now the student nods through much of this
because Peterson is expanding on the issue</a>
00:02:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h02m09s">that the student himself raised.</a>
00:02:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h02m11s">The more that Jordan elaborates on the student’s
point, the more that he feels heard and understood.</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h02m16s">What’s interesting is that when Jordan then
lays out a perspective the student hasn’t</a>
00:02:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h02m20s">considered before, the nodding continues,
Jordan: “And so the consequences of the</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h02m24s">regulation become, incalculably worse as a
problem than the problem that they were designed</a>
00:02:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h02m33s">to deal with.</a>
00:02:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h02m35s">To think otherwise is to think in this sort
of Utopian manner”.</a>
00:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h02m38s">Now if Jordan just lept into what this student
had missed, that nodding probably would not</a>
00:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h02m43s">have been there and more importantly, the
student would not have been open to a new</a>
00:02:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h02m47s">idea.</a>
00:02:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h02m48s">But in laying out the points of agreement
and expanding on the point of the person that</a>
00:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h02m52s">you are speaking with, you actually create
more likely likelihood that they’re going</a>
00:02:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h02m55s">to open up to other perspectives.</a>
00:02:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h02m58s">When you’re trying to establish your points
of commonality or even you’re differences,</a>
00:02:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h03m01s">you don’t actually know for certain if you
understand what the other person thinks.</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h03m06s">So what is best to speak in terms like these,
Jordan: “Okay so then, it also seems like</a>
00:03:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h03m11s">we agree that the core element of tribal alliance,
which would have its roots in the Chimpanzee…”</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h03m17s">Jordan: “Well, you’re basically--what
you’ve basically stated, so far as I can</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h03m21s">tell, there would be a socio-culture agreement…”</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h03m23s">To be crystal clear you can’t just say “so
you’re saying” and then fill in the straw</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h03m27s">man argument, we saw how that turned out in
the other video we did on Jordan Peterson.</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h03m32s">You have to clarify the other person’s point
in a way that they would agree with.</a>
00:03:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h03m36s">Now when this is done in good faith, there
is a profound difference between using the</a>
00:03:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h03m40s">phrase “It seems like” and simply saying
“What you’re doing”.</a>
00:03:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h03m43s">“It seems like” invites correction and
it comes from a desire to engage in a dialogue,</a>
00:03:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h03m48s">rather than telling the other person what
logical leaps they’re making.</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h03m52s">I also mentioned the phrase it seems like
in our last video on tells that you’re dealing</a>
00:03:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h03m56s">with an arrogant or person who is lacking
in confidence so if you want to know more</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h04m02s">But you will eventually have to come to contentious
points of disagreement in your conversation</a>
00:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h04m07s">in your conversation, it’s inevitable.</a>
00:04:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h04m08s">And there is a number of ways to make your
stance clear without making the other person</a>
00:04:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h04m12s">feeling attacked.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h04m13s">You can begin, for instance, by establishing
your good intentions like this, Jordan: “What’s</a>
00:04:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h04m17s">the--and I’m not trying to trap you here
I’m seriously not”.</a>
00:04:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h04m20s">Jordan: “We’re on the same page there,
now but, what I noticed when you wrote the</a>
00:04:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h04m26s">moral landscape, and I’m not trying to trap
you, you tell a story about…”</a>
00:04:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h04m32s">It’s counter to instinct, but you need to
come back to this feeling of not wanting to</a>
00:04:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h04m36s">trap the other person and you need to do it
often.</a>
00:04:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h04m39s">When you say this congruently it diffuses
the core issue with most arguments, which</a>
00:04:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h04m43s">is we so easily become identified with our
views, after all, they're OUR views.</a>
00:04:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h04m50s">So when those views are attacked and dismantled,
we as individuals feel attacked and dismantled.</a>
00:04:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h04m55s">This does sound extreme but being trapped

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h05m29s">But for the purpose of this video, make it
clear that you’re not attacking the person.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h05m34s">You are merely disagreeing with a particular

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h05m49s">it, and as far as I can tell is laudable.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h05m51s">But the problem is, as far as I can tell,
there’s problems it doesn’t solve and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h05m56s">there’s other problems it leaves unaddressed
that don’t have to be unsolved or unaddressed”.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h06m00s">This is especially effective because deep
down people are terrified of being wrong,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h06m05s">the existential feeling of being wrong for

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h06m18s">So in saying that “I have an issue with
the argument” and by the way in saying</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h06m22s">“the argument” as opposed to “your argument”
is wise because in saying that you make it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h06m27s">clear that you don’t think the individual
is tied to that argument.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h06m30s">When you do that you’re saying that the

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h06m34s">triggering their ego and its defense mechanisms

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h06m40s">This is a pattern of validating the individual,

up against your points like this, Sam: “Then</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h06m49s">there must be a deeper level of reality that

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h07m07s">And you’ll make the other person feel understood
and open to change by noting your own willingness</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h07m12s">to reconsider your own opinions, like this, Jordan: 
“One of the things that I’ve been re-considering</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h07m16s">since we talked last night, is the nature

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h07m21s">but rather than belabor these points let me
make one larger distinction that ties them</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h07m26s">In order to win in any argument, the best
thing you can do is not identify with “your</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h07m39s">the point of breaking and even when the person
you’re talking isn’t so nice about it,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h07m58s">and that’s worth--that can be worth paying
quite a price for”.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h08m01s">Actually internalizing the mindset is a massive
undertaking, meditation helps, even so, you’re</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h08m22s">So if you take only one thing from this video
before enduring your next argument, discussion,</a>
00:08:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h08m27s">debate, whatever you like to call it.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h08m28s">I’d advise it to be this, ask yourself “Do
I want to be BE RIGHT?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h08m34s">Or do I want to do what it takes to GET IT
RIGHT?”.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h08m37s">You might not destroy anyone with that mentality
but you're going to win the argument because</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h08m41s">you’re going to walk away with a clearer
understanding of the truth.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h08m45s">Now I think a huge reason that Jordan is capable
of being so calm during these interactions</a>
00:08:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h08m50s">is that of his time as a clinician, he learned
to listen and help people who often feel attacked.</a>

or impose their view of how you should live</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS5nmy1v34c#t=00h09m12s">and I think that the opportunity to speak
