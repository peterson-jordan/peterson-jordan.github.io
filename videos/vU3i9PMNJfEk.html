					<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h00m00s">My nephew had a dream at one point.</a>
00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h00m05s">This little–someone made a little animated thing out of it and put it on the internet, which is quite cool.</a>
00:00:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h00m09s">So anyways he was having night terrors, and he ran around like a little knight,</a>
00:00:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h00m15s">you know, K-N-I-G-H-T, knight. And he had a little, you know,</a>
00:00:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h00m21s">armor and a sword. And he'd run around the house with a little knight hat on being a knight!</a>
00:00:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h00m26s">And he was only like four or something, and he'd watched a lot of Disney movies–a lot of movies–</a>
00:00:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h00m31s">so he kinda got the knight idea.</a>
00:00:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h00m33s">It was at–he's acting that out, and he was having those terrors at night, right?</a>
00:00:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h00m37s">So he'd go to bed with his little knight hat and his sword, and he'd put 'em on his bed. And then</a>
00:00:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h00m42s">at night he'd wake up screaming, and that happened for a very long time. And so</a>
00:00:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h00m46s">when I went to visit, you know, I found out that this was happening, and he had a night terror.</a>
00:00:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h00m51s">So the kid wakes up with night terrors, screaming, but can't remember anything, generally speaking. So</a>
00:00:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h00m57s">anyways, this was happening.</a>
00:00:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h00m58s">And so what happened one day, and I was sitting with him and his family at the breakfast table, and I said,</a>
00:00:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h01m05s">"Did you have a dream?" And he said, "Oh yes, I had a dream." I said well, we know,</a>
00:01:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h01m10s">"What was your dream?" And he said, "Well</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h01m12s">"I was out on this</a>
00:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h01m13s">"field, and I was surrounded by these dwarves, and they came up to my knees,</a>
00:01:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h01m18s">"and they were–they didn't have any arms they had big feet, and they were</a>
00:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h01m22s">"covered with hair, and there was a cross shaved at the top of their head, and they were all greasy and they had huge beaks, and</a>
00:01:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h01m28s">"everywhere I went they jumped at me with their beaks, and there was lots of them!"</a>
00:01:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h01m31s">And everybody was very quiet after he said this because it was like,</a>
00:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h01m36s">"Oh, that's why you're screaming at night!" It's like, "Yeah, okay!"</a>
00:01:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h01m42s">And then he said, "But at the background there was a dragon, and the dragon would blow out</a>
00:01:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h01m49s">"smoke and fire, and then it would turn into these dwarves!" So it's like, "Man,</a>
00:01:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h01m52s">"that kid had a problem, right?" It was like, "Well, what are you gonna do? You fight off a dwarf, who cares?"</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h01m57s">It's like, "Puff, ten more. That's life man. That's life.</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h02m02s">"Really, that's the hydra. You cut off one head, seven more grow.</a>
00:02:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h02m06s">"That's life. Snakes everywhere.</a>
00:02:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h02m08s">"And you get rid of one, there'll be more." And so he figured that out. It's a hell of an existential shock when you're four!</a>
00:02:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h02m16s">And so he's like, he's a knight. He's thinking, "What do I do about these dwarfs?</a>
00:02:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h02m19s">"Well, there's too many of them, but there's a dragon." Also I said, "Well, what could you do about that?"</a>
00:02:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h02m25s">Right? Loaded question. It implies that you could DO something about that.</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h02m31s">Well, he kind of knew that, which is why he was running around like a knight.</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h02m34s">He kind of figured that out, and he said "Well, I get my dad,</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h02m39s">"when I jump up on the dragon and I poke out both of its eyes with my sword and then I go right down its</a>
00:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h02m43s">"stomach</a>
00:02:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h02m44s">"to the place where the fire came out–the fire box–and then I carve a piece of the fire box out and I make</a>
00:02:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h02m50s">"a shield." And that would be the end of that, and I thought, "Wow!</a>
00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h02m54s">"Good work, kid!" Like, "You really got it." Right? It's the central human story.</a>
00:02:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h03m01s">There's the terrible unknown, right? Fire-breathing,</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h03m04s">generating trouble, and what do you do? You confront that. You confront that, and by confronting it you get stronger.</a>
00:03:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h03m10s">That's the shield, and that's what a human being is. And that's right.</a>
00:03:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h03m16s">It's exactly right, and that was the end of his night terrors, by the way, which seems too good to be true.</a>
00:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h03m21s">But it is actually true because I followed up with his mother for a long time, and that was that.</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h03m25s">He catalyzed that part of his identity.</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h03m28s">He adopted the role of the mythological hero, and that's what he needed to do because, like, there was lots of dread–</a>
00:03:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h03m34s">there's a dragon and a bunch of dwarves! Like, "What the hell are you going to do about that? Run?</a>
00:03:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h03m38s">"That's not gonna help."</a>
00:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h03m39s">You know, if you run in a dream like that, the doors multiply, and they get bigger, and you get smaller as you run.</a>
00:03:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h03m46s">It's like, that's not a good–that is NOT a good solution. And people do that in their life all the time. And so the</a>
00:03:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h03m54s">dwarves get bigger until they're giants, and they get smaller until there's nothin' left of them. And then</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3i9PMNJfEk#t=00h04m01s">there's no recovery. That is NOT good.</a>
