<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h15m54s">So I dunno what to make of that.</a>
00:15:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h15m58s">Alright. So. How did I prepare for this?</a>
00:15:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h16m02s">Uhm.</a>
00:16:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h16m03s">I went -- I familiarized myself to the degree that it was possible</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h16m07s">with Slavoj Žižek's work,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h16m14s">and this debate was put together in relatively short order.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h16m17s">And what I did instead was return to what I regarded as the original cause of all the trouble, let's say,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h16m28s">because that's Marx, and we're here to talk about Marxism, let's say,</a>

00:17:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h17m06s">that I have rarely read a tract</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h17m21s">It was quite a miraculous re-read.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h17m24s">And it was interesting to think about it psychologically as well because</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h17m27s">I've read student papers that were of the same ilk, in some sense,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h17m46s">But that notwithstanding, I have some things to say about that author's psychologically.</a>
00:17:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h17m51s">The first thing is that it doesn't seem to me that either Marx or Engels</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h17m59s">which is that almost all ideas are wrong.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h18m14s">your job is to assume, first of all, that they're probably wrong,</a>

00:18:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h18m24s">And what struck me about the Communist Manifesto was, it was akin to</a>
00:18:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h18m28s">something Jung said about</a>
00:18:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h18m30s">typical thinking, and this was the thinking of people who weren't trained to think.</a>
00:18:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h18m33s">He said that the typical thinker has a thought, it appears to them like an object might appear in a room,</a>
00:18:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h18m40s">the thought appears, and then they just accept it as true.</a>
00:18:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h18m45s">They don't go the second step, which is to think about the thinking.</a>
00:18:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h18m51s">And that's the real essence of critical thinking,</a>
00:18:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h18m53s">and so that's what you try and teach people in university,</a>
00:18:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h18m56s">is to read a text and to think about it critically</a>
00:18:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h18m59s">-- not to destroy the utility of the text, but to separate the wheat from the chaff.</a>
00:18:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h19m04s">And so what I tried to do when I was reading the Communist Manifest was to separate the wheat from the chaff.</a>
00:19:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h19m10s">And I'm afraid I've found some wheat, yes, but mostly chaff.</a>
00:19:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h19m14s">And I'm going to explain why,</a>
00:19:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h19m16s">umm, hopefully, uhh,</a>
00:19:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h19m18s">in relatively short order.</a>
00:19:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h19m19s">So I'm going to outline 10 of the fundamental axioms of the Communist Manifesto.</a>
00:19:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h19m26s">And so these are truths that are basically held as self-evident by the authors.</a>
00:19:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h19m31s">They're truths that are presented in some sense as unquestioned, and I'm going to question them</a>
00:19:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h19m37s">and tell you why I think they're unreliable.</a>
00:19:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h19m42s">Now, we should remember that this tract was actually written 170 years ago --</a>
00:19:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h19m46s">that's a long time ago!</a>
00:19:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h19m48s">And we have learned a fair bit since then about human nature,</a>
00:19:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h19m53s">about society, about politics, about economics.</a>
00:19:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h19m55s">There's lots of mysteries left to be solved,</a>
00:19:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h19m59s">but we are slightly wiser, I presume, than we were at one point and so</a>
00:19:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h20m04s">you can forgive the authors to some degree for what they didn't know</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h20m07s">but that doesn't matter given that the essence of this doctrine</a>
00:20:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h20m13s">is still held as sacrosanct by a large proportion of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h20m18s">academics.</a>
00:20:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h20m20s">Probably.</a>
00:20:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h20m21s">Are among the most -- what would you call? --</a>
00:20:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h20m24s">guilty of that particular sin.</a>
00:20:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h20m28s">So, here's proposition number one:</a>
00:20:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h20m31s">1. History is to be viewed primarily as an economic class struggle.</a>
00:20:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h20m37s">Alright, so let's think about that for a minute.</a>
00:20:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h20m41s">First of all, the proposition there is that history is primarily to be viewed through an economic lens,</a>
00:20:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h20m47s">and I think that's a debatable proposition because</a>
00:20:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h20m50s">there are many other motivations that drive human beings than economics</a>
00:20:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h20m54s">and those have to be taken into account.</a>
00:20:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h20m56s">Especially that drive people other than economic competition, like economic cooperation, for example.</a>
00:20:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h21m03s">And so, that's a problem.</a>
00:21:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h21m05s">The other problem is that it's not nearly a pessimistic enough description of the actual problem because history</a>
00:21:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h21m14s">history, this is to give the devil his due,</a>
00:21:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h21m20s">The idea that one of the driving forces between history is hierarchical struggle is absolutely true.</a>
00:21:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h21m28s">But the idea that that's actually history is not true, because it's deeper than history,</a>
00:21:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h21m34s">it's biology itself because organisms of all sorts organize themselves into hierarchies.</a>
00:21:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h21m39s">And one of the problems with hierarchies is that they tend to arrange themselves into a winner-take-all situation</a>
00:21:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h21m46s">and so,</a>
00:21:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h21m47s">and that is implicit in some sense in Marxist thinking because, of course,</a>
00:21:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h21m51s">Marx believed that in a capitalist society capital would accumulate in the hands of fewer and fewer people.</a>
00:21:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h21m57s">And that actually is in keeping with the nature of hierarchical organizations.</a>
00:21:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h22m01s">Now, the problem with that isn't so much the fact of</a>
00:22:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h22m07s">so there's accuracy in the accusation that that is a eternal form of motivation for struggle</a>
00:22:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h22m15s">but it's an underestimation of the seriousness of the problem</a>
00:22:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h22m18s">because it attributes it to the structure of human societies rather than the deeper reality</a>
00:22:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h22m24s">of the existence of hierarchical structures per se,</a>
00:22:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h22m26s">which as they also characterize the animal kingdom to a large degree are clearly not only human constructions.</a>
00:22:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h22m33s">And the idea that there's hierarchical cometeition among human beings,</a>
00:22:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h22m38s">there's evidence for that that goes back at least to the Paleolithic times.</a>
00:22:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h22m42s">And so that's the next problem, it's that, well,</a>
00:22:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h22m46s">this ancient problem of hierarchical structure is clearly not attributable to capitalism</a>
00:22:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h22m53s">because it existed long in human history before capitalism existed</a>
00:22:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h22m59s">and then it predated human history itself.</a>
00:22:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h23m02s">So the question then arises, why would you necessarily, at least implicitly,</a>
00:23:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h23m07s">link the class struggle with capitalism given that it's a far deeper problem?</a>
00:23:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h23m11s">And now, it's also, you've gotta understand that this is a deeper problem for people on the left,</a>
00:23:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h23m15s">not just for people on the right.</a>
00:23:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h23m17s">It is the case that hierarchical structures dispossess those people who are at the bottom</a>
00:23:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h23m22s">those creatures who are at the bottom, speaking, say of animals.</a>
00:23:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h23m25s">-- but those people who are at the bottom, and that is a fundamental existential problem.</a>
00:23:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h23m30s">But the other thing that Marx didn't seem to take into account is that</a>
00:23:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h23m33s">there are far more reasons that human beings struggle than their economic class struggle</a>
00:23:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h23m40s">even if you build the hierarchical idea into that, which is a more comprehensive way of thinking about it.</a>
00:23:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h23m46s">Human beings struggle with themselves, with the malevolence that's inside themselves,</a>
00:23:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h23m50s">with the evil that they're capable of doing, with the spiritual and psychological warfare that goes on within them,</a>
00:23:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h23m56s">and we're also actually always at odds with nature, and this never seems to show up in Marx.</a>
00:23:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h24m03s">And it doesn't show up in Marxism in general. It's as if nature doesn't exist.</a>
00:24:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h24m08s">The primary conflict, as far as I'm concerned, or a primary conflict</a>
00:24:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h24m12s">that human beings engage in is the struggle for life in a cruel and harsh natural world.</a>
00:24:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h24m19s">And it's as if that doesn't exist in the Marxist domain.</a>
00:24:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h24m24s">"If human beings have a problem it's because there's a class struggle, it's essentially economic"</a>
00:24:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h24m28s">it's like, no!</a>
00:24:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h24m29s">Human beings have problems because we come into the life starving and lonesome</a>
00:24:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h24m35s">and we have to solve that problem continually,</a>
00:24:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h24m37s">and we make our social arrangements, at least in part, to ameliorate that.</a>
00:24:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h24m41s">As well as to, well, upon occasion exacerbate it.</a>
00:24:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h24m45s">And so there's also very little understanding in the Communist Manifesto</a>
00:24:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h24m49s">that any of the hierarchical organizations that human beings have put together might have a positive element.</a>
00:24:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h24m56s">And that's an absolute catastrophe because hierarchical structures are actually necessary to solve complicated social problems,</a>
00:24:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h25m03s">we have to organize ourselves in some manner,</a>
00:25:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h25m05s">and you have to give the devil his due, and so it is the case that hierarchies dispossess people</a>
00:25:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h25m11s">and that's a big problem. That's the fundamental problem of inequality.</a>
00:25:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h25m15s">But it's also the case that hierarchies happen to be a very efficient way of distributing resources</a>
00:25:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h25m19s">and it's finally the case that human hierarchies are not fundamentally predicated on power.</a>
00:25:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h25m26s">And I would say the biological/anthropological data on that are crystal clear.</a>
00:25:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h25m31s">You don't rise to a position of authority that's reliable in a human society primarily by exploiting other people.</a>
00:25:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h25m39s">It's a very unstable means of obtaining power, so --</a>

00:25:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h25m43s">so that's a problem.</a>
00:25:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4#t=00h25m47s">Well, the people who laugh might do it that way.</a>
00:25:47</p>
