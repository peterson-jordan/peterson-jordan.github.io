00:00:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h00m15s">the last time we were here we got maybe a third of the way through this story</a>
00:00:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h00m23s">the story of Pinokio and the transformation of a marionette into something hypothetically real</a>
00:00:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h00m30s">I'm gonna backtrack a few slides and it'll get us into it again</a>
00:00:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h00m35s">so you remember that the blue fairy, so I would say that the benevolent element of mother nature</a>
00:00:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h00m43s">in the schemata that we are going to use to investigate mythology</a>
00:00:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h00m47s">was more or less allowed her entrance because Gepetto was a good guy and he wished for the right thing</a>
00:00:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h00m54s">and so in some sense... here's a way of thinking about that... you know</a>
00:00:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h00m59s">genetic / environmental studies on children's temperament have revealed something quite interesting</a>
00:00:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h01m05s">which is that the shared environment that children have within a family</a>
00:01:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h01m12s">so that would be what's the same about your environment and your brother's environment, the same</a>
00:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h01m16s">doesn't have that much effect on your temperament or his temperament</a>
00:01:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h01m20s">'cause the presumption always was that within a family there is a shared environment, right?</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h01m25s">and something was common about the environment to every child within that environment</a>
00:01:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h01m30s">but there isn't much of a shared environmental effect on temperament</a>
00:01:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h01m34s">so then you can say, well that makes it appear as though isn't that relevant in relationship to the development of temperament</a>
00:01:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h01m40s">but you could also suggest something else</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h01m43s">you could suggest that if parenting is occurring properly, the effect of the shared environment should be very close to zero</a>
00:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h01m51s">and the reason for that is that you establish an individual relationship with each child</a>
00:01:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h01m58s">and the environment is actually a microenvironment that's composed of your observations of this child and that specific child's interaction with you</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h02m06s">like to some degree, if there is a shared environment, that means that you're forcing the same principles on every child</a>
00:02:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h02m12s">so my suspicions are, although I don't know this, and the research hasn't been done</a>
00:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h02m17s">that in bad families there's a shared environmental effect, but in good families that minimizes</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h02m23s">so that lets the child's biological predisposition, roughly, manifest itself with support and in some positive manner</a>
00:02:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h02m32s">well, I don't want to extend the analogy too far, but you can imagine</a>
00:02:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h02m38s">that, and this is what this film proposes, if you aim properly in relationship to your child</a>
00:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h02m44s">what you're trying to do is to establish an individual relationship and to allow them to move towards</a>
00:02:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h02m49s">whatever their particular expression of individuality happens to be</a>
00:02:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h02m54s">and that's... that would be the same as allowing nature to take its course in some sense</a>
00:02:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h02m58s">at least nature in its positive guise, and that's exactly what happens here</a>
00:02:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h03m02s">the other thing that happens, of course, is that the cricket, for reasons that aren't clear, precisely</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h03m09s">is knighted by the blue fairy and serves as Pinokio's conscience</a>
00:03:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h03m15s">although he isn't very good at it, which is a very peculiar thing, and quite a marked point that the film is making</a>
00:03:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h03m22s">that that conscience actually has something to learn, too</a>
00:03:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h03m25s">and there's actually a Freudian element to that, you know, because Freud thought of the superego</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h03m30s">as the internalization, roughly speaking, of the father,</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h03m34s">and it could be very severe, the superego, so like a really strict father, really tyrannical father inside your head</a>
00:03:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h03m40s">although I think it's better to think about the superego as the internalized representation of society at large</a>
00:03:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h03m47s">mediated to some degree through your parents, 'cause it's not as if your father, even assuming he's tyrannical</a>
00:03:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h03m53s">is the inventor of all those tyrannical rules, he's the  propagator of them</a>
00:03:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h03m58s">but he's actually a proxy voice, even if it's just for the harsh side of society, he's the proxy voice for society</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h04m05s">and because we're social creatures, the utility of having an internal social voice to guide you</a>
00:04:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h04m12s">although, again, you seem to be able to follow it or not follow it, which I also find spectacularly interesting</a>
00:04:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h04m18s">because, obviously if it was an unerring guide, you could just follow it</a>
00:04:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h04m22s">and if it was an unerring guide, you wouldn't need free will either, because you could just act out the dictates of this internal representation</a>
00:04:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h04m30s">that isn't what you do</a>
00:04:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h04m32s">so anyways, the proposition here is that the conscience exists, but it's a relatively flawed entity</a>
00:04:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h04m38s">it needs to be modified as well by nature</a>
00:04:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h04m42s">which is quite interesting, 'cause the blue fairy knights him, 'cause you also might think of the conscience as only something that's socially constructed</a>
00:04:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h04m49s">right, which is the more typical viewpoint, but I don't buy that for a second</a>
00:04:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h04m53s">because I believe firmly, and I believe the Piagetian interpretation of child development</a>
00:04:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h05m01s">more or less bears this out, is that there are parameters within which conscience has to operate</a>
00:05:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h05m07s">and it's sort of like this, it's like, it's the same parameters that govern fair play, we'll say that</a>
00:05:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h05m14s">and so you can say there's fair play within a game, and there's fair play across sets of games</a>
00:05:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h05m20s">and the set of games is pretty much indistinguishable from the actual environment</a>
00:05:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h05m26s">if you think all the things you do as nested games, at some point the spread of that is large enough so that it encompasses everything you do</a>
00:05:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h05m34s">which includes the environment, and so I believe that you're adapted to the set of all possible games, roughly speaking</a>
00:05:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h05m42s">all possible playable games, something like that</a>
00:05:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h05m45s">and that you know the rules for that, which is why, we talked about this a little bit, why you're so good at identifying cheaters</a>
00:05:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h05m51s">we have a module for that, according to the evolutionary psychologists</a>
00:05:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h05m54s">and not only you identify them, but you remember them, it really sticks in your mind</a>
00:05:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h05m59s">and there's other evidence, too, one piece of evidence that I love, well, there's a couple</a>
00:05:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h06m06s">one I would derive from Frans de Waal, who's a famous primatologis, and he studied the prototype morality that emerges in chimpanzees</a>
00:06:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h06m14s">and it's very much nested in their dominance structures</a>
00:06:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h06m18s">you know, because you could think of morality in some sense as the understanding of the rules by which the dominance hierarchy operates, right</a>
00:06:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h06m25s">and so you could say, well, the biggest, ugliest, meanest chimp...</a>
00:06:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h06m29s">and the male dominance hierarchies in chimps seem to be the predominant ones, although the females also have a dominance hierarchy</a>
00:06:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h06m34s">it's not quite so clear in bonobos, which seem to be more female-dominated</a>
00:06:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h06m39s">but in any case, the primary chimp dominance structure is male</a>
00:06:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h06m44s">and you could think, well it's like the caveman chimp who's biggest and toughest who necessarily rules, and who rules longest</a>
00:06:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h06m52s">but that isn't what de Waal  found; see, the problem with being... mean, lets say</a>
00:06:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h06m58s">and not negotiating your social landscape, and not trading reciprocal favors</a>
00:06:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h07m04s">is that no matter how powerful you are as an individual, two individuals three quarters your power could do you in</a>
00:07:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h07m12s">and that happens with the chimps fairly regularly; if the guy on top is too tyrannical</a>
00:07:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h07m18s">and doesn't make social connections, then weaker chimps, males, make good social connections</a>
00:07:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h07m24s">and when he's not in such good shape, they take him down, and viciously too</a>
00:07:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h07m27s">de Waal has documented some unbelievably horrendous acts of, let's call it, regicide</a>
00:07:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h07m33s">among the chimpanzee troupes that he studied, mostly in the Arnhem zoo</a>
00:07:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h07m37s">the big troupe there, that's been there a long time</a>
00:07:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h07m41s">but he's very interested in prototypical morality, and here's some other examples of prototypical morality</a>
00:07:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h07m47s">emerging among animals, there's many of them, but one is</a>
00:07:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h07m50s">you know, if two wolves have a dominance dispute, again that would be more likely among the male wolves</a>
00:07:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h07m55s">but it doesn't really matter, they basically display their size, and they growl ferociously</a>
00:07:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h08m00s">and they puff up their hair so they look bigger, and you can see cats do that when they go into fight or flight</a>
00:08:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h08m06s">not only do they puff up, including their tail, but they stand sideways</a>
00:08:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h08m10s">and the reason they do that is because they look bigger</a>
00:08:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h08m13s">right, 'cause they're trying to put up the most intimidating possible front</a>
00:08:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h08m16s">so anyways, if two wolves are going at it, what they're really trying to do is to size each other up</a>
00:08:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h08m22s">and they're trying to scare each other into backing off, fundamentally</a>
00:08:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h08m26s">because, see, the worst-case scenario is like, you're wolf number one, and I'm wolf number two</a>
00:08:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h08m31s">and we tear each other to shreds, but I win, but I'm so damaged after that wolf number three comes in and takes me out</a>
00:08:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h08m37s">so, like, there's a big cost to be paid even for victory in a dominance dispute, if it degenerates into violence</a>
00:08:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h08m43s">and animals, and human beings, but animals in particular, have evolved very, very specific mechanisms</a>
00:08:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h08m50s">to escalate dominance disputes towards violence step by step</a>
00:08:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h08m56s">so that they don't... so that the victor doesn't risk incapacitating himself by winning</a>
00:08:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h09m02s">so what happens with the wolves is that, you know, they growl at each other and posture display, and maybe they even snap at each other</a>
00:09:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h09m09s">but the probability that they're gonna get into a full-fledged fight is pretty low</a>
00:09:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h09m13s">and what happens is, one of the wolves backs off,  and flips over and shows his neck</a>
00:09:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h09m17s">and that basically means: "all right, tear it out," and the other wolf says:</a>
00:09:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h09m22s">though of course he doesn't, "well, you're kind of an idiot, and you're not that strong, but we might need you to take down a moose in the future</a>
00:09:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h09m28s">and, you know, despite your patheticness, I won't  tear out your throat"</a>
00:09:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h09m32s">and then they've established their dominance position, and then, from then on, at least for some substantial period of time</a>
00:09:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h09m38s">the subordinate wolf gives way to the dominant wolf</a>
00:09:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h09m41s">but at least the subordinate wolf is alive, and, you know, he might be dominant over other wolves</a>
00:09:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h09m46s">and so, everyone in the whole hierarchy has sorted that out either through mock combat or through combat itself</a>
00:09:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h09m52s">and, you know, the low-ranking members aren't in the best possible position, but at least they're not getting their heads torn off every second of their existence</a>
00:09:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h10m01s">so there's even some utility in the stability of the dominance hierarchy for the low-ranking members</a>
00:10:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h10m06s">'cause at least they're not getting pounded, getting threatened, which is way better</a>
00:10:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h10m11s">I mean it's not good, but it's way better than actual combat</a>
00:10:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h10m14s">and then there's the example of rats, which I love, this is Jaak Panksepp's work</a>
00:10:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h10m18s">and he wrote a book called affective neuroscience, which I highly, highly recommend</a>
00:10:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h10m23s">I have a list of readings, recommended readings on my website</a>
00:10:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h10m26s">it's a brilliant book, and he's a brilliant psychologist, really, one of the top psychologists as far as I'm concerned</a>
00:10:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h10m33s">both theoretically and experimentally, a real genius, he's the guy who discovered that rats laugh when you tickle them</a>
00:10:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h10m40s">they laugh ultrasonically, so you can't actually hear them, but if you record it and slow it down</a>
00:10:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h10m45s">then you can hear them giggling away when you tickle them with an erase, which  is sort of like their mother's tongue</a>
00:10:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h10m50s">it's often what lab people use as a substitute for the licking of the little rat by the mother</a>
00:10:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h10m55s">so, and he discovered the paly circuit in mammals, which is like a major deal, right</a>
00:10:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h11m00s">he should get a Nobel prize for that, that's a big deal to discover an entire motivational circuit</a>
00:11:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h11m05s">whose existence no one had really predicted, you know, apart from the fact that obviously mammals play</a>
00:11:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h11m11s">and even lizards maybe, some of them are social lizards, seem to play</a>
00:11:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h11m15s">so, anyhow, what Panksepp observed, and I think this is a brilliant piece of science</a>
00:11:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h11m21s">is that, first of all, juvenile male rats in particular like to rough and tubmle play</a>
00:11:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h11m28s">like to wrestle, and they actually pin each other like little kids do, or like adult wrestlers do</a>
00:11:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h11m33s">they pin their shoulders down, and that basically means you win, and so, OK, so that's pretty cool</a>
00:11:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h11m38s">but what's even cooler, I think, well there's three things, one is:</a>
00:11:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h11m42s">the rats will work for an opportunity to get into an arena where they know that play might occur</a>
00:11:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h11m47s">and so that's one of the scientific ways of testing an animal's motivation, right</a>
00:11:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h11m51s">so imagine you have a starving rat and it knows that it's got food down in the end of a corridoor</a>
00:11:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h11m57s">you can put a little spring on its tail and measure how hard it pulls, and that gives you and idication of its motivational force</a>
00:11:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h12m03s">now, imagine the starving rat that's trying to get to some food, and you have a little spring on its tail, and you waft in some cat odor</a>
00:12:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h12m11s">so now that rat is starving and wants to get out of there, he's going to pull even farther towards the food</a>
00:12:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h12m17s">so getting away plus getting forward are separate motivational systems, and if you can add them together it's real potent</a>
00:12:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h12m23s">and part of the reason why in the future authoring exercise that you guys are gonna do as the class progresses</a>
00:12:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h12m29s">you're asked to outline the place you'd like to end up, which is your desired future</a>
00:12:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h12m33s">and also the place that you could end up if you let everything fall apart</a>
00:12:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h12m37s">so that your anxiety chases you and your approach systems pull you forward</a>
00:12:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h12m43s">you're maximally motivated then, and it's important, because otherwise you can be afraid of pursuing the things you wanna pursue</a>
00:12:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h12m51s">right, and that's very common, and so then the fear inhibits you as the promise pulls you forward</a>
00:12:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h12m56s">but it makes you weak, because you're afraid; you wanna get your fear behind you, pushing you</a>
00:12:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h13m01s">and so what you wanna be is more afraid of not pursuing your goals than you are of pursuing them</a>
00:13:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h13m07s">it's very, very helpful; and lots of times in life, and this is something really worth knowing</a>
00:13:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h13m12s">you know, and this is one of the advantages to being an autonomous adult</a>
00:13:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h13m16s">you don't get to pick the best thing, you get to pick your poison</a>
00:13:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h13m20s">you have two bad choices, and you get to pick which one you're willing to suffer through</a>
00:13:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h13m24s">and every choice has a bit of that element in it, and so, if you know that it's really freeing</a>
00:13:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h13m30s">because otherwise you torture yourself by thinking: "well, maybe there's a good solution to this, compared to the bad solution"</a>
00:13:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h13m36s">it's like, no, no, sometime's there's just risky solution 1, and risky solution 2</a>
00:13:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h13m41s">and sometimes both of them are really bad, but you at least get to pick which one you're willing to suffer through</a>
00:13:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h13m48s">and that's... that actually makes quite a bit of difference, because you're also facing it voluntarily then</a>
00:13:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h13m53s">instead of it chasing you, and that is an entirely different psychophysiological response</a>
00:13:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h13m59s">challenge vs threat, it's not the same, even if the magnitude of the problem is the same</a>
00:13:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h14m05s">and so putting yourself in a challenging, let's call it, mindframe, you can't just do that by magic</a>
00:14:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h14m10s">putting yourself in a challenging mindframe is much easier on you psychophysiologically</a>
00:14:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h14m15s">'cause you don't produce... you don't go into the generalized stress response to the same degree</a>
00:14:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h14m20s">and you're activating your exploratory and seeking systems, which are dopaminergically mediated, and that involve positive emotion</a>
00:14:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h14m26s">so if you can face something voluntarily, rather than having it chase you, it's way better for you psychophysiologically</a>
00:14:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h14m34s">so, that's partly why, well, it's worthwhile to go find the dragon in its lair instead of waiting for it to come and eat you</a>
00:14:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h14m42s">so, and especially if you also add the idea that if you go find the dragon in its lair</a>
00:14:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h14m47s">you might find it when it's a baby, instead of a full-fledged bloody monster that is definitely gonna take you down</a>
00:14:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h14m53s">and so that's part of the reason why... well there's a whole bunch of things that emerge out of that observation</a>
00:14:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h15m00s">like: don't avoid small problems that you know are there</a>
00:15:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h15m04s">face them, because they'll grow into big problems all by themselves</a>
00:15:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h15m09s">and you can think about... imagine the tax department sends you a notification, you owe them, like, 300 dollars</a>
00:15:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h15m15s">well it's, you know, that's annoying, maybe you don't even wanna open the letter</a>
00:15:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h15m19s">or maybe if you do, you just put it on the shelf, but that damn thing doesn't just sit there like a piece of paper on the shelf</a>
00:15:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h15m25s">right, you ignore that for 5 or 6 years, it's gonna become attached to all sorts of horrible things</a>
00:15:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h15m31s">and if you ignore it long enough... you get the idea, it's gonna turn into something that's completely unlike the little piece of paper that it's written on</a>
00:15:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h15m39s">and many, many problems in life are like that, you'll see that they pop their ugly little head up, and you know</a>
00:15:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h15m47s">and you might wanna turn away, you might not want to think about it</a>
00:15:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h15m51s">which is the easiest way of turning away, right, you just don't attend to it</a>
00:15:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h15m55s">it's not like you repress it or anything like that, you just fail to attend to it</a>
00:15:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h15m59s">and that's a... really, as a long-term strategy it's dismal</a>
00:15:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h16m03s">it's also something, I think, that's more characteristic of people who are high in neuroticism and high in agreeableness</a>
00:16:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h16m09s">'cause agreeable people don't like conflict</a>
00:16:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h16m11s">and people who are high in neuroticism, or high in negative emotion, are hit harder per unit of uncertainty or threat</a>
00:16:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h16m18s">and so, you know, and that's partly why in psychotherapy a lot of times the people you see need assertiveness training</a>
00:16:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h16m24s">so that would be the opposite of agreeableness, or they need help to get their anxiety and emotional pain under control</a>
00:16:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h16m30s">those are not the only reasons, there's antisocial behavior, but you can't fix that in therapy in all likelyhood</a>
00:16:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h16m35s">there's alcoholism, there's lotsa, lotsa other reasons, but those are two major reasons</a>
00:16:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h16m39s">so anyways, there is a... that was all to telly you that... oh yes, back to the rats</a>
00:16:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h16m46s">so okay, the rats are pulling on... you can measure rat motivation by how hard they pull on the spring, let's say</a>
00:16:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h16m52s">and they're more motivated if they're running away and they're running towards, but let's go back to play</a>
00:16:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h16m57s">so, you can take juvenile rats who haven't been able to play for a while, maybe they've been isolated</a>
00:16:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h17m02s">or maybe they just haven't been able to engage in physical activity, like many schoolchildren that you might be thinking about</a>
00:17:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h17m09s">neither allowed to play nor engage in physical activity, and there's a reason I'm telling you that</a>
00:17:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h17m15s">so anyways, you get one of these little rats, and you can measure how hard he'll pull to go out and play</a>
00:17:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h17m20s">or how many buttons he'll push, you know, and that gives you an indication of his motivation</a>
00:17:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h17m24s">so anyways, you can see that the play-deprived juvenile rat will fight harder to play than a non-play deprived juvenile rat</a>
00:17:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h17m32s">and so you can infer that the rat wants to go play</a>
00:17:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h17m37s">and, you know, you do that... you do the same measurement with everyone around you</a>
00:17:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h17m41s">if they wanna do something, you're gonna poke and prod at them to see what sort of things they're willing to overcome</a>
00:17:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h17m47s">in order to go and do that, you'll object even if you don't really object</a>
00:17:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h17m51s">it's like... it's a measurement device, and if they're willing to overcome a bunch of your objections</a>
00:17:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h17m56s">then you think: "oh, well, maybe they really want to"</a>
00:17:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h17m58s">and that's another thing to really know: if there's something you want, you need about five arguments about why you want it</a>
00:17:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h18m06s">because the probability that the person who's opposing you will have five arguments about why you should't have it is very low</a>
00:18:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h18m13s">they just won't have thought it through enough; so the other thing that happens in the future authoring exercise</a>
00:18:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h18m18s">is that you're asked to articulate the reasons for all the goals that come out of your vision of the future</a>
00:18:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h18m24s">so you're asked like: "why would it be good for you? why would it be good for your family? why would it be good for broader society?"</a>
00:18:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h18m30s">so that gives you three levels of argumentation right there</a>
00:18:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h18m33s">and if you have it articulated down into detail, and it's related to other important goals</a>
00:18:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h18m38s">they you're a hell of a thing to argue with, because people just aren't that deep</a>
00:18:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h18m43s">by which I mean that they just don't have that many levels of explanation or objection</a>
00:18:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h18m48s">and it's also really useful in relationship to your own mind, because if you want to do something that's difficult</a>
00:18:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h18m53s">and that requires energy, a lot of different subsystems  in your mind are gonna throw up objections</a>
00:18:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h18m59s">it's like, "well, maybe that isn't what you should be doing right now, maybe you should be doing the dishes</a>
00:18:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h19m03s">or vacuuming, or watching TV, or looking at YouTube"</a>
00:19:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h19m05s">if you're really sneaky, when you're trying to do something hard, what your brain does</a>
00:19:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h19m11s">is give you something else hard to do that 's not quite as hard, so that you can feel justified in not doing the thing you're supposed to</a>
00:19:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h19m16s">'cause you're doing somethig else useful, and if you give in to that temptation, which you often will</a>
00:19:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h19m21s">then it wins, and because it wins, it gets a little dopamine kick, and it grows stronger</a>
00:19:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h19m26s">anything you let win the internal argument, grows</a>
00:19:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h19m30s">and anything you let be defeated, shrinks</a>
00:19:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h19m33s">'cause it's punished, it doesn't get to have its way</a>
00:19:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h19m37s">so that's another thing really to remember, don't practice what you do not wanna become</a>
00:19:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h19m42s">and because those are... they're neurological circuits, you build those thing in there man, and they're not going anywhere</a>
00:19:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h19m49s">you can build another little machine to inhibit them, that's the best you can do</a>
00:19:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h19m53s">once they're in there, you can't get them out, so... and then the one's you built to inhibit can be taken out by stress</a>
00:19:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h19m59s">and the old habits will come back up, so you gotta be careful what you say and what you do</a>
00:19:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h20m04s">because you build yourself that way; so anyways, back to the rats</a>
00:20:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h20m09s">okay, so the little rat gets to go out there and play, now imagine one little rat is paired with another rat</a>
00:20:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h20m14s">but the other little rat is 10% bigger, 10% in juvenile rats is enough to attain permanent dominance</a>
00:20:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h20m21s">so the 10% bigger rat will win the first wrestling, and so that's what happens</a>
00:20:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h20m28s">and then... so the little rat gets pinned, and maybe they play a bit, and then they're done with it</a>
00:20:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h20m33s">and so you separate them, then you let them play again, and the next time what happens</a>
00:20:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h20m37s">is that the subordinate rat does the invitation to play</a>
00:20:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h20m40s">and that's like, you know, like a dog does when he wants to play</a>
00:20:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h20m44s">you can recognize that, it kind of splays its feet apart, and looks up and looks interested</a>
00:20:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h20m48s">and then it sort of dances around; you can do it with any kid that has a clue, you know</a>
00:20:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h20m53s">that hasn't been destroyed by adults, if your little 3-year-old, or 4-year-olds are better for this</a>
00:20:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h20m58s">if you go like this, like, they know exactly what's gonna happen, you know, they're ready to dart back and forth</a>
00:20:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h21m02s">and they'll usually smile, and kids love rough and tumble play, which is now basically illegal in all daycare</a>
00:21:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h21m10s">seriously, it's seriously is, kids need it so desperately, 'cause it teaches them the limits of their body</a>
00:21:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h21m16s">and your body, and it teaches them what's painful and what isn't</a>
00:21:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h21m20s">and it teaches them the dance of play, and without that they're just little disembodied blobs</a>
00:21:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h21m26s">like, they have no finesse, that's what you're checking out when you dance with someone, you know</a>
00:21:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h21m30s">you're seeing if they have that fluency and facility for mutual reciprocal action</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h21m36s">embodied in them; and if they're kinda like this, you know, and don't have any sense of rhythm and don't pay any attention to you</a>
00:21:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h21m43s">and all of that, you have reason to question whether they actually inhabit their body</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h21m48s">and whether they can engage in a mutual interaction, physical interaction that's going to be reciprocal and mutually satisfying</a>
00:21:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h21m56s">it's really important to check out; and a lot of that rough and tubmle play, even interactions between a child and its mother</a>
00:21:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h22m02s">if you have a happy mother and a happy infant, and you videotape them, and you speed up the video tape, you'll see that they're dancing</a>
00:22:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h22m10s">so one responds, then the other responds, then the other responds, it might be just with eye gaze, and movement, and all of that</a>
00:22:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h22m16s">but there's a dynamic interplay, which you don't see with depressed mothers and their infants</a>
00:22:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h22m21s">so, okay, so back to play, so the little rat, who is the subordinate one, he has to do the invitation</a>
00:22:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h22m28s">and then the big rat can agree to play, 'cause he's in the dominant position</a>
00:22:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h22m33s">but if you pair them repeatedly, and this is really worth thinking about</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h22m38s">because, you see, morality emerges out of repeated interactions</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h22m55s">but they have to keep moving around, 'cause otherwise people figure out who they are</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h23m12s">so anyways, if you repeatedly pair these rats, unless the big rat lets the little rat win at least 30% of the time</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h23m20s">the little rat will not ask the big rat to play</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h23m33s">that's even incarnated in rats, that emerges across multiple play sessions</a>
00:23:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h23m37s">it's like, yes, exaclty, that's exactly what Piaget said about the emergence of morality</a>
00:23:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h23m42s">it's exactly the same idea, at the rat level, so it's a massively...</a>
00:23:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h23m47s">and the fact that there's a circuit, a separate neurophysiological circuit</a>
00:23:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h23m51s">that's actually specialized for that sort of thing is also a big deal</a>
00:23:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h23m55s">now the other thing  Panksepp figured out is that if you deprive juvenile rats of the opportunity to engage in rough and tumble play</a>
00:23:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h24m02s">their prefrontal cortexes don't develop properly</a>
00:24:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h24m05s">and they become impulsive and restless, and then you can fix them with methylphenidate or ritalin</a>
00:24:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h24m11s">and those are the drugs that are used to fix hyperactive kids, most of who are male</a>
00:24:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h24m17s">and that's because, well, really, you're gonna take your six-year-old, your five-year-old</a>
00:24:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h24m22s">you're gonna put them in a desk, you're gonna get them to sit there for six hours, that's your plan, right?</a>
00:24:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h24m28s">that's a stupid plan; and they're denied the opportunity to engage in play</a>
00:24:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h24m34s">and that means that their ability to become social is being impaired</a>
00:24:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h24m39s">it may cause neurological impairment, that's what the rat evidence suggests</a>
00:24:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h24m43s">and then you suppress that with amphetamines, 'cause amphetamines actually activate the play circuit</a>
00:24:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h24m49s">they activate a different circuit, which will suppress the play circuit</a>
00:24:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h24m53s">so it's very, very... it's not very wise, and I'm not gonna go off on that tangent</a>
00:24:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h24m58s">because I could tell you why the school systems were set up that way, which I probably will at some point</a>
00:24:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h25m04s">because it's quite and interesting story in and of itself, and it's the reason all you guys are sitting in desks right now</a>
00:25:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h25m10s">somebody laughingly referred to this once as grade 15, that was pretty funny, given the look of the bloody place, you know</a>
00:25:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h25m17s">hideous... okay</a>
00:25:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h25m22s">so, now, this is an interesting thig, so you got the emergence of morality in, say chimps</a>
00:25:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h25m27s">you got the emergence of morality in wolves, you got the emergence of morality in rats</a>
00:25:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h25m31s">and the morality governs sequential interactions or group interactions, they have to repeat</a>
00:25:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h25m37s">because, because it's an emerging property of social or repetitive interactions</a>
00:25:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h25m43s">that's why, you can't just localize it in one instance, it's repeated</a>
00:25:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h25m47s">and there's been computer simulations of this</a>
00:25:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h25m50s">they help you figure out how you might attain victory across games, across time</a>
00:25:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h25m54s">maybe you need a strategy, and there's a very simple strategy, which, I believe is called "modified tit for tat"</a>
00:25:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h26m01s">so if you're nice to me, I'm nice back, and if you do something bad to me, I do something bad back</a>
00:26:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h26m06s">but imagine you run that out in sequences of behavior, and see who does with what strategy across time</a>
00:26:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h26m13s">or an alternative strategy... [?] here's the best strategy: I trust you, you trust me, we start interacting</a>
00:26:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h26m19s">you screw up, I whack you, and then I forgive you, and we start again</a>
00:26:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h26m23s">that's modified tit for tat, and so...</a>
00:26:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h26m26s">it's a very simple algorithm; no one has come up with a better algorithm in a computerized simulation of game space than that particular strategy</a>
00:26:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h26m36s">so it's like: trust but don't be a pushover, if someone violates the rules, you gotta nail them</a>
00:26:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h26m41s">but then you don't hold a grudge, you open the door to further interactions</a>
00:26:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h26m46s">so, pretty smart, pretty smart</a>
00:26:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h26m48s">and, okay, so anyways... so what this means, 'cause rats can't talk, and wolves can't talk, and chimpanzees can't talk</a>
00:26:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h26m55s">and what that means, just as Piaget suggested, was that the morality, the development of the morality</a>
00:26:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h27m01s">precedes the development of the linguistic ability to describe the rules for the morality</a>
00:27:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h27m06s">he said exactly the same thing about kids, right, is that they learn to play games before they know what the rules are to the games</a>
00:27:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h27m13s">and so, you see that when you're playing peek-a-boo with a kid, they can pick that up really young</a>
00:27:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h27m18s">they get that right away, and there's... you can play with kids almost immediately after they're born, if you play simple enough games</a>
00:27:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h27m25s">so they've got that deep, and they're unbelievably playful</a>
00:27:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h27m28s">so, they've got that circuitry ready to go right off the bat, and it's one of the things that makes kids so much fun</a>
00:27:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h27m35s">because they just like to play all the time, and so if you... if the play circuit in you hasn't died</a>
00:27:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h27m42s">which is a bad thing, then you can use that a lot with your kids, and it's one of the things that helps you love them</a>
00:27:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h27m48s">so that's a good thing, so, okay</a>
00:27:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h27m51s">so, the point is that the damn morality emerges before the representation of the morality</a>
00:27:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h27m58s">it's a big deal to know that, and that it emerges as a consequence of repeated social interaction</a>
00:27:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h28m03s">so it's not a top-down thing, it's a bottom-up thing</a>
00:28:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h28m07s">now, Piaget says: well, it's not just bottom-up, because what happens with human beings is that they learn to play the games...</a>
00:28:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h28m13s">one of his experiments was: watch seven-year-olds, I think that's the right age, play marbles</a>
00:28:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h28m20s">and then he noticed that they can play with each other, and that they can follow the rules</a>
00:28:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h28m25s">but that if you take the individual seven-year-old out of the game, and you say: what are the rules?</a>
00:28:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h28m29s">they give incoherent and incomplete explanations of the rules</a>
00:28:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h28m33s">so what that means is they don't really represent the rules, but they can act them out</a>
00:28:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h28m38s">and have a partial representation of what they're acting out</a>
00:28:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h28m41s">now, when they get older, the rule representation starts to fall into alignment with the actual rules of the game</a>
00:28:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h28m47s">and you can imagine that's why [?], because when they're playing something like marbles, they're gonna have discussions like: you're cheating</a>
00:28:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h28m53s">or: you're not allowed to do that, 'cause they're always gonna be pushing the envelope a little bit</a>
00:28:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h28m58s">and then the group is gonna render a judgment on whether or not that's appropriate</a>
00:28:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h29m01s">and out of that the rules are going emerge, but they're not rules to begin with, they're patterns of behavior</a>
00:29:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h29m07s">it's not the same thing as a rule, a rule describes a pattern of behavior</a>
00:29:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h29m12s">but a pattern of behavior is a pattern of behavior, it's something that's acted out</a>
00:29:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h29m16s">so, there's the individual within the group and then the interactions of the individuals within the group produce a hierarchical arrangement</a>
00:29:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h29m24s">or multiple hierarchical arrangements, those are games, roughly speaking, or stories</a>
00:29:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h29m29s">nested iside an overarching story, which is the fundamental culture</a>
00:29:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h29m33s">right, and that's nested within a whole bunch of competing cultures that have some commonalities</a>
00:29:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h29m38s">or they would just be at war all the time, which, you know, to some degree they are</a>
00:29:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h29m44s">so, okay, now, you see that... back to the movie, you see that happening in the movie</a>
00:29:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h29m51s">I mean it's very, very quick, but the blue fairy turns the bug into the conscience</a>
00:29:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h29m57s">and then the bug tries to explain to Pinokio what the rules of morality are</a>
00:29:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h30m02s">but the thing is the bug doesn't know, because he's just a bug, and you know, he's just not omniscient, so</a>
00:30:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h30m07s">the best he can do is to come up with, like, a propagandistic semantic, verbal representation</a>
00:30:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h30m15s">that's internally contradictory, and when he tells Pinokio, Pinokio has no idea what he's talking about</a>
00:30:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h30m20s">and neither does the bug, that's the thing; and so...</a>
00:30:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h30m24s">so what happens is this, the cricket says: well Pinok, maybe you and I had better have a little heart-to-heart talk</a>
00:30:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h30m29s">and the puppet says: why? 
and the cricket says: well, you wanna be a real boy, don't you?</a>
00:30:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h30m36s">alright, sit down son, now you see the world as full of temptations</a>
00:30:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h30m41s">- temptations?
- yes, temptations, they're the wrong things that seem right at the time</a>
00:30:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h30m47s">but even though the right things may seem wrong sometimes, sometimes the wrong things may be right at the wrong time</a>
00:30:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h30m55s">or vice versa, understand?
- no!</a>
00:30:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h31m00s">no, and neither did the cricket, and that's actually very nicely done in that piece of the movie</a>
00:31:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h31m06s">because you just wanna slap him as soon as he starts talking like that</a>
00:31:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h31m11s">because he gets up on his little matchbox and lectures, and he's dull and tyrannical, both at the same time</a>
00:31:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h31m17s">and so there's nothing genuine about what he's saying, he's imitating something that isn't him</a>
00:31:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h31m22s">so he's really acting like a puppet at that point, too, and it doesn't work at all</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h31m27s">and so Pinokio says: I'm going to try to be a good boy; and the cricket says: well that's the spirit, son</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h31m36s">alright, so then we're at the next day, 'cause this all happens in one night</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h31m44s">that's actually, that's a bit of foreshadowing there, you know</a>
00:31:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h31m48s">so, um, you have to remember, when you watch something like this movie</a>
00:31:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h31m53s">not a single bit of it is random or accidental, none of it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h32m10s">you're not doing that accidentally, it's really expensive, and everyone has to agree on exactly what's going to happen</a>
00:32:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h32m16s">and you might say: well, do the people who are doing this consciously know what they're doing?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h32m21s">and the answer to that is: well, sort of, just like you do, it's yes, they know, and no, they don't</a>
00:32:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h32m27s">and they know because they're really smart and gifted, and all that, but they don't know, because it's not all articulated</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h32m33s">plus they're working in a group, so they know and don't know, just like you do when you're watching it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h33m00s">right, or at things you're afraid of, like you look at things with valence</a>

00:36:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h36m15s">is: watch yourself, watch your fantasies, because they're always happening, and they'll tell you something</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h36m33s">and that means we've touched on something that has a multiplicity of elements</a>

00:36:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h36m43s">or maybe you laughed, or you drifted at least, it's like... it's because some other thought has entered your field of consciousness</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h36m49s">and if you can get the person to grab those thoughts, to notice them</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h36m53s">then you can often figure out the avenues along which that particular conversation might unfold</a>
00:36:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h36m59s">that's a complex, that's a Jungian complex or a psychoanalytic complex</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h37m03s">it's like, there's an emotional core that produces a whole range of associated ideas</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h37m28s">so you watch, and when you drift... you'll drift, and the fantasy is partly a representation of of the problem space</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h37m36s">you know, that happens when you wake up at three in the morning and you're worried about things</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h37m39s">right, 'cause actually what happens is you wake up during threat processing</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h37m43s">and if you're depressed, actually that gets so intense, you can't sleep, so then you just lay there all night, worrying</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h37m55s">and the fantasies can also breed solutions, and that's partly why Freud regarded dreams as wish-fulfillments</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h38m02s">it's partly... and he wasn't... that was where he stopped; it's not correct</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h38m09s">it's partially correct, it's like the fantasy will provide you with a problem and a potential solution</a>
00:38:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h38m15s">but they're more like problem-identification mechanisms, the fantasies, with the possibility of a solution built in</a>
00:38:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h38m24s">and so, a way of thinking about that is that you can generate potential futures</a>
00:38:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h38m31s">so they're like each segregateable environments, according to the rules of your fantasy</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h38m36s">then you can generate little avatars of yourself that inhabit each of those little universes, and you can run them as simulations</a>
00:38:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h38m41s">and then you can watch what happens in the simulation, and if it's a catastrophy, then you don't have to act it out</a>
00:38:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h38m47s">and that's exactly, not exactly, that's akin to what you're doing when you go watch a movie</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h38m53s">except that is much more coherent and well thought-through, than just a dream, which is often quite fragmentary</a>
00:38:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h39m00s">that's partly 'cause the dream is willing to sacrifice coherence to play with category structures</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h39m08s">you know, and that's why in dreams things can change one thing into another really weirdly</a>
00:39:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h39m12s">or scenes can change from one scene into another without a logic, the logic gets loosened</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h39m20s">and it's dangerous to do that, and that's partly why you do it while you're asleep and paralyzed</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h39m26s">you know, you don't run around and act out your pseudopodal fantasies, where you're stretching yourself out into the world</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h39m50s">and of course that's a standard Christian symbol, although, as I mentioned</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h39m59s">but this movie has very strong pagan elements in it, as I mentioned before</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h40m08s">but that's foreshadowing, and what it foreshadows is that, well, a new day has dawned</a>
00:40:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h40m13s">it's  the emergence of new consciousness, and everything last night went well, really well</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h40m19s">everything in the... let's call it the unconscious, say, after time stops, that all went well, and so the new day is full of promise</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h40m25s">and so, the birds are singing, and the sun is shining, and, like, hurray</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h40m30s">this is the next scene, right, so it sets the tenor for that scene just like the introductory song does</a>
00:40:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h40m38s">so anyways, then you see all these kids playing and enthusiastic, so they're off to school</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h40m44s">which is presented in a positive light, and so that's where you get socialized</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h41m01s">you can think about it, again, as the internalized representation of nature and society</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h41m07s">and so he's not going out there alone, even though he's not very good at it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h41m39s">their primary idea might be: well, what if the other kids don't like me</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h41m44s">that's a big one; what if the teachers don't like me, what if the other kids won't play with me</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h41m55s">so... but that's not Pinokio, he's like, spinning out, ready to go</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h41m59s">and so... good, good, he's got... naive, but enthusiastic, ok, well at least that gets the ball rolling</a>
00:41:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h42m06s">now, you've got these two evil creatures here, the fox and the cat</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h42m11s">I think this one's based on one of the Marx brothers, actually, Harpo Marx, who, I believe, never said anything</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h42m17s">but, be that as it may, they're these ne'er-do-well characters, the fox in particular</a>
00:42:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h42m23s">now fox is standard trickster animal, right, it's a... classic animal, maybe because it's good at hiding, and it's good at hunting</a>
00:42:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h42m33s">I don't know exactly why, but coyotes are like that, too</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h42m38s">they're classic trickster animals, he's kinda like Wile E. Coyote, in fact</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h42m43s">you know, the Warner Brothers character who's genius at large, and whose arrogance continually gets him wallopped</a>
00:42:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h42m51s">and this character has a lot of features like that, but he feigns being an English gentleman of the 1890s</a>
00:42:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h42m59s">and pretends to be educated, and has a kinda high-blown way of talking, and he's a fraud through and through</a>
00:42:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h43m06s">and he's got this sidekick who's barely there at all, and he doesn't treat him that well</a>
00:43:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h43m15s">but he's got someone to lord it over, so that keeps his dominance hierarchy thing going well</a>
00:43:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h43m20s">and the fact that he's like a second-rate companion, well, he never really notices that</a>
00:43:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h43m25s">although he'll treat him contemptuously whenever he gets a chance</a>
00:43:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h43m28s">so anyways, they're walking down the street, and the fox is bragging away about some crooked thing that he's done</a>
00:43:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h43m35s">how he pulled the wool over someone's eyes, and he confuses that with wisdom and intelligence</a>
00:43:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h43m41s">and one of the things that you see, this is worth knowing too, because</a>
00:43:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h43m44s">if you're preyed upon by a psychopath, which you will be to some degree at some point in your life</a>
00:43:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h43m51s">the psychopath, who will be narcissistic, will presume that you're stupid</a>
00:43:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h43m56s">and that you deserve to be taken advantage of, because you're naive and stupid, so it's actually a good thing that he's doing it</a>
00:43:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h44m02s">and his proof... and I'm saying "he," because there are more male psychopaths</a>
00:44:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h44m08s">the proof that you're stupid and naive is that he can take advantage of you</a>
00:44:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h44m14s">and so, like, if you were wiser, you'd be a, you know, you'd know his tricks</a>
00:44:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h44m18s">then it wouldn't be morally necessary for him to show you just exactly who knows what about what</a>
00:44:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h44m24s">and so, the psychopath will use his ability  to fool you as proof of his own grandiose omnipotence, omniscience, and narcissism</a>
00:44:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h44m36s">and the problem with that is that you can be fooled by a psychopath, and virtually anybody can</a>
00:44:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h44m41s">so that Robert Hare, for example, who's studied psychopaths for a long time</a>
00:44:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h44m45s">and interviewed a lot of them, like hundreds of them, and videotaped many of the interviews</a>
00:44:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h44m51s">he said when he was talking to the psychopath he always believed what they were saying</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h44m53s">and then he's watch the video afterwards, and see where the conversation went off the rails</a>
00:44:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h44m58s">but, you know, the proclivity to be polite in a conversation is very strong</a>
00:44:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h45m06s">and if you're polite, you don't object to the way that the person unfolds their strategy, you know</a>
00:45:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h45m12s">and psychopaths are pretty good at figuring out how to manipulate, obviously, how to manipulate people</a>
00:45:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h45m17s">and the probability that you will be immune to that is extraordinarily low</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h45m40s">because they don't trust him, because he did a few little things seventeen years ago</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h45m52s">and you know, he was a repeat sexual offender, and murderer</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h46m13s">and then when they answer, he looks at his fingernails, which is, like, that's a lovely little manipulative thing</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h46m18s">'cause it basically means: whatever happens to be under my fingernail at the moment is much higher priority than your foolish story</a>

00:48:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h48m20s">it's like, well, they're in that camp, they think they are good people, but they're not, they're just never anywhere where you could be bad</a>
00:48:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h48m26s">and as soon as you put them somewhere, where they could be bad, it's like, out it comes, just like that</a>
00:48:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h48m31s">and that's really worth thinking about, 'cause most of you, many of you, but not all of you, I suspect</a>
00:48:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h48m39s">have never really been somewhere that you could be really bad and get away with it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h48m44s">and so you might think, well, you wouldn't do it, but people do it, all the time</a>
00:48:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h48m51s">so anyways, they're talking about some exploits, and</a>
00:48:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h48m54s">then they see that this character named Stomboli, he has a puppet show, right</a>
00:48:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h49m00s">and he's kind of a wheeler-dealer too</a>
00:49:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h49m03s">remember, I showed you that mas that was glaring at Pinokio when he got his voice?</a>
00:49:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h49m08s">it's like, Stromboli is one of his manifestations, the fox here is another one of his manifestations</a>
00:49:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h49m15s">all the negative characters throughout the movie are manifestations of the same thing</a>
00:49:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h49m20s">it's partly the adversarial individual, and it's partly the tyrrannical aspect of society</a>
00:49:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h49m25s">it's the negative masculine, that's one way of thinking about it</a>
00:49:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h49m28s">so, and you know, when men go bad, they often go bad by being antisocial and tyrrannical</a>
00:49:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h49m33s">there's way more antisocial men than there antisocial women, which is why there's twenty times as many men in jail as there are women</a>
00:49:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h49m40s">so each gender, let's say each sex has it's own characteristic pathologies</a>
00:49:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h49m46s">and there are some antisocial women, you know, and there are some high-neuroticism guys</a>
00:49:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h49m51s">or some guys who are really agreeable as well, but they're rare</a>
00:49:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h49m57s">so anyways, he sees this poster advertising Stromboli's puppet show</a>
00:49:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h50m05s">so Stromboli's a puppet master; now that's really worth thinking about, because that's an archetypal theme</a>
00:50:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h50m12s">or it's at least attached to an archetypal theme: something's behind the scenes, pulling the strings</a>
00:50:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h50m19s">and everyone always wonders what that is, what's actually going on; what's actually going on with Trump?</a>
00:50:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h50m25s">who's actually in control? is it Putin? I mean that's the fantasies of the left, it's Putin</a>
00:50:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h50m32s">it's like, well, the question always is, what's going on behind the scene</a>
00:50:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h50m38s">right, and the question is... that's the case certainly on the political landscape, business landscape, interpersonal relations</a>
00:50:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h50m44s">what are you really up to, everyone's always wondering that, right, it's why they're watching you eyes</a>
00:50:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h50m50s">'cause your eyes point at things, and they can infer what you're interested in, and what you're up to by looking at what you look at</a>
00:50:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h50m57s">and that's why your eyes have whites, it's so that we can see where you're pointing them, 'cause gorillas don't</a>
00:50:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h51m03s">and so what that means, roughly speaking, is that all of your ancestors whose eyes couldn't be reliably tracked</a>
00:51:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h51m10s">were either killed or didn't mate, it's a big deal for us to see where people's eyes are pointed</a>
00:51:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h51m17s">and so we're always watching each other's eyes, constantly; what are you up to, what are you up to?</a>
00:51:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h51m21s">what are you looking at? what do you want? I wanna know, because if I know what you want, I can predict how you're gonna behave</a>
00:51:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h51m27s">and that also means I can cooperate with you, or I can compete with you, or I can lie to you</a>
00:51:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h51m32s">but all the information is in the eyes, surrounded by the facial display, right, 'cause that's also an indication of motivation and emotion</a>
00:51:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h51m40s">our eyes are so good at that, that for you guys sitting there in the back, I can tell if you're looking at my eyes or at my chin</a>
00:51:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h51m49s">and the deviation in your eyes is so tiny, that it's a kind of miracle that we're capable of making that perceptual observation</a>
00:51:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h51m57s">it's really important to us, so and we have really good eyes, so that's another thing about us</a>
00:51:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h52m02s">so anyways, what's going on behind the scenes? well, if you look at Stromboli, you might be thinking:</a>
00:52:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h52m09s">it's not clear he's someone you'd want to have pulling your strings</a>
00:52:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h52m14s">there's a little bit of, forced ethusiasm, let's say, there, and he's just not a very savory looking character</a>
00:52:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h52m21s">so anyways, the fox knows him, and they start talking about Stromboli, that old joker</a>
00:52:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h52m28s">how they could possibly involve him in some sort of scam, because he's back in town</a>
00:52:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h52m34s">and then they see the puppet, and the fox does his equivalent of thinking</a>
00:52:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h52m39s">which is, you know, pretty sad and nasty, but that's what he does</a>
00:52:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h52m43s">and then they see this puppet with no strings, and they think: hey man</a>
00:52:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h52m47s">a puppet master would pay a lot for something that is capable of semi-autonomous movement like that</a>
00:52:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h52m53s">it would be kind of a miracle; and so they decide that they would take him to Stromboli</a>
00:52:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h52m58s">and so they grab him, and, hah, he's got an apple to take to the teacher, which, I think it's the cat, promptly eats</a>
00:52:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h53m06s">and the fox acts out this false enthusiasm about what Pinokio is up to, and pretends that he's his friend</a>
00:53:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h53m16s">which is of course what your typical pedophile will do, and so this is in the same kind of category</a>
00:53:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h53m22s">and it truly is; one of the things that's interesting to know about pedophiles is that they're predatory, right</a>
00:53:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h53m29s">and so they don't go after kids that are assertive and likely to be noisy</a>
00:53:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h53m36s">they watch, and they watch to see if they can find a kid who's defeated, and...</a>
00:53:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h53m42s">that's good enough, who's defeated, and who's gonna need a friend, and who's not going to object</a>
00:53:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h53m49s">and so when they check out... these are the ones who do the stranger abductions, which are, by the way, extraordinarily rare</a>
00:53:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h53m54s">they look for a victim type, they look for a kid who's gonna be easy to take down</a>
00:53:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h54m00s">and so, you know, that's one thing you don't want... so you might think, well...</a>
00:54:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h54m04s">one of the things that was really big, it's probably even worse now, when I was a parent of young children</a>
00:54:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h54m10s">was to teach your kids how to be afraid of strangers, it's like, uh, no, wrong, that is not what you teach them</a>
00:54:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h54m19s">because all you do is teach them then to be timid and fearful, and the real predatory types, they're pretty much thrilled about that</a>
00:54:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h54m27s">'cause you'll also make them sheltered and naive</a>
00:54:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h54m31s">you make your kids courageous, and you get their damn eyes open, and that's the best thing you can do against people who are truly dangerous</a>
00:54:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h54m38s">so, none of that terrifying... it's not a good idea</a>
00:54:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h54m44s">anyways, the fox befriends the puppet, and then they come up with this evil scheme to get him off to Stromboli, the puppet master</a>
00:54:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h54m52s">and away they go, and they sing a little song about being an actor, "an actor's life for me"</a>
00:54:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h54m58s">this took me along time to figure out, I thought: they're taking Pinokio away to be an actor</a>
00:54:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h55m04s">now why in the world are actors getting such a rough time in this movie?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h55m09s">it's like, it's a Hollywood movie, you know, it's acting, obviously, the voiceovers and all of that are acting</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h55m16s">it's... why is this thing about being an actor? and then I thought: oh, I get it, I see what's going on</a>
00:55:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h55m23s">they sing to Pinokio about the delights of unearned celebrity</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h55m48s">and how popular they are, part of that is this desire that people have for unearned celebrity</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h55m54s">because you can ge to the top without any sacrifices and without any work, and if you're really cynical</a>

00:56:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h56m13s">but the actor idea here is that you can pretend to be something you're not</a>

00:57:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h57m12s">is when a child is seriously overprotected, usually a male child by his mother</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h57m18s">now, the reverse can be the case, and it can be a female child by the mother, and all of that</a>
00:57:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h57m22s">but I'll just talk about the classic case to begin with</a>
00:57:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h57m25s">now, what Freud observed was that there were usually not very good boundaries in families like that</a>
00:57:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h57m30s">and so, the relationship between the husband and the wife was either strained or nonexistent</a>
00:57:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h57m35s">and the wife would often turn to the child to be what she isn't getting from the husband</a>
00:57:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h57m40s">and so, there's a great South Park episode about this, a wonderful South Park episode</a>
00:57:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h57m46s">where... I don't remember that horrible little guy 
[student: Cartman] 
yeah, that's him</a>

00:57:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h58m04s">because she brings in this expert, who then she wants to have an affair with, so that's a boundary issue</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h58m09s">and he basically separates her son from him [sic], and imposes the same discipline on him, that he would impose on a bad dog</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h58m24s">there's a horse whisperer movie, too, about the original horse whisperer that does a beautiful job of laying that out, too</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h58m40s">anyways, what happens in the South Park episode is that the dog whisperer gets Cartman straightened out</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h58m47s">and he starts, like, dressing properly, and doing his homework, and...</a>

00:58:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h59m03s">is bribe Cartman, basically, out of doing his homework, so that he can accompany her to, I don't know, a fast food restaurant or something like that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h59m11s">and so, the reason she does that is 'cause she's lonesome, and doesn't have anybody else around</a>
00:59:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h59m15s">and, you know, maybe she's also deeply, deeply, deeply terrified that if she helps that boy grow up, he will leave</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h59m24s">you know, and so, mothers who don't have something, say, outside their infants</a>
00:59:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h59m29s">not merely their children, are more likely to fall into that, and it's no wonder</a>
00:59:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h59m33s">you know, you gotta think that through; and lots of women, most women, really fall in love with their babies</a>
00:59:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h59m41s">and so, even if they start growing into larger children that can be threatening</a>
00:59:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h59m45s">because when the child... when the infant turns into a toddler, the infant is dead</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=00h59m53s">the toddler is there now; and you can radically interfere with that process, that happens all the time</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h00m00s">that's the classic Freudian oedipal nightmare</a>

01:00:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h00m07s">some of you've been in my personality class and watched "Crumb", the documentary "Crumb"</a>
01:00:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h00m12s">and that's another staggering exposition of exactly that kind of pathology</a>
01:00:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h00m17s">anyways, one of the things Jung pointed out...</a>
01:00:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h00m20s">so I knew this guys once, who had a mother who basically was trying that trick</a>
01:00:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h00m25s">and she was very smart, and had lots of tricks up her sleeves, and there was just no way he was gonna go for it</a>
01:00:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h00m31s">he rebelled at every possible moment, and he basically became, I would say, somewhat hypermasculine in response</a>
01:00:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h00m37s">which is an interesting lesson with regards to the hypermasculinity that boys often develop when they're raised by single mothers</a>
01:00:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h00m43s">'cause they tend to go one of two ways</a>
01:00:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h00m46s">and he just fought her at every step of the way, and it didn't happen</a>
01:00:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h00m50s">but one of the things Jung said, which I loved, and you can really see this in the "Crumb" documentary</a>
01:00:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h00m55s">is that the oedipal mother basically entices the child, she says: look</a>
01:00:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h01m00s">here's the deal, you don't have to do anything, but you don't get to leave</a>
01:01:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h01m05s">and if you don't leave, and you don't to these difficult things, then I'll take care of you</a>
01:01:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h01m10s">and the child has a choice, all the way along there, I mean, obviously he's outclassed in some sense, but it's not as obvious as you'd think</a>
01:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h01m17s">little kids are tough, and they make decisions all the time</a>
01:01:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h01m20s">and so Jung thought about it more as a conspiracy than as something imposed on the child by the mother</a>
01:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h01m26s">and I really like that, it's actually a conspiracy between mother, father, and child, actually</a>
01:01:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h01m30s">and I think that's a good way of looking at it, even though it's really rough, 'cause</a>
01:01:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h01m34s">well, should you hold the child responsible? well, yes, but judiciously, and not completely</a>
01:01:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h01m40s">'cause then if you deal with someone like that as an adult, and they're trying to escape from it</a>
01:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h01m45s">you have to go all the way back and figure out how the hell it happened</a>
01:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h01m49s">they have to figure out where they opened the door, like inviting a vampire in</a>
01:01:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h01m54s">'cause they can't come in unless you invite them in, so don't invite them in</a>
01:01:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h01m58s">'cause once they're in they're really hard to  get rid of, and they'll take all your blood</a>
01:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h02m03s">so that's a cautionary tale</a>
01:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h02m06s">so anyways, Pinokio doesn't know any better, and he's got the egotism of youth</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h02m37s">it's all this idea of wealth and public exposure</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h02m47s">and so it's a dual attraction, right, you get everything you want, and you don't have to do anything</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h02m52s">geez, what a deal; and so that's what the actor represents, it's a liar, fundamentally</a>
01:02:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h02m58s">it's someone who's acting out a deception, they're a persona in the Jungian sense</a>
01:02:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h03m03s">so the persona is the mask you wear in public that you might even think you are. but you're not</a>
01:03:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h03m11s">it's this mask, and that's the actor, that's the persona</a>
01:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h03m14s">so the fox and the cat are inviting the puppet to only become a persona</a>
01:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h03m20s">see, for Jung, you start as a persona, and then, when you start to investigate the parts of you that don't really fit in that persona</a>
01:03:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h03m30s">and that would be the shadow, then you start understanding who you really are</a>
01:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h03m34s">and that's shocking, because the persona contains everything, roughly speaking, that you think is good</a>
01:03:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h03m40s">and maybe even that your immediate culture thinks is good</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h03m43s">and then the shadow contains everything's that's not part of that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h03m46s">and some of that's really bad, but some of it is good disguised as bad</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h03m52s">and you can't break out of the persona and transcend it until you incorporate a lot of what's in the shadow</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h04m17s">and that's a really bad attitude to have, for example, towards adult males</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h14m02s">and it sounds like a good offer, and also the fox is actually quite forceful, he basically takes him by the hand</a>
01:14:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h14m08s">so the temptation is, and this is something else I like about the movie</a>
01:14:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h14m13s">you can't just say: "well, the puppet gets what he deserves"</a>
01:14:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h14m16s">'cause he's little and naive, and what he's facing is really malevolent, truly malevolent</a>
01:14:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h14m23s">and physically overpowering, and so the movie does a nice job of not minimizing the threat that's posed by this particular temptation</a>
01:14:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h14m31s">and that's part of what makes it art</a>
01:14:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h14m34s">so we'll stop there, we'll have a break for 15 minutes, and then we'll start with the stage</a>
01:14:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h14m40s">alright, so here we are, at the big event, and Pinokio is off to be a celebrity</a>
01:14:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h14m47s">and the cricket is watching, and Pinokio basically...</a>
01:14:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h14m55s">well, he's got some natural talent, because he's a puppet, but he doesn't have strings</a>
01:14:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h15m00s">he goes on stage with strings, and then he drops his strings, and the whole crowd is amazed</a>
01:15:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h15m05s">and the crowd should be amazed when that happens; you can imagine when a kid goes to school</a>
01:15:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h15m10s">and shows some independence, that that's actually gonna... people are gonna notice that</a>
01:15:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h15m19s">his peers are gonna notice that, the teachers are gonna notice that</a>
01:15:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h15m23s">maybe it's too much independence even, but it's still a... it is a remarkable thing, too</a>
01:15:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h15m27s">it's so interesting, you can see marked signs of independence in children, well, right from the time they're born, basically</a>
01:15:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h15m35s">because one of the things that's really funny about the infants, is when they're crying, you always think:</a>
01:15:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h15m41s">"oh, the baby's sad", it's like, no, a lot of the time that baby is angry</a>
01:15:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h15m47s">and the way that we know that is because you can do facial expression coding on infants, just like on adults</a>
01:15:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h15m56s">and you can tell what emotion they're expressing, and very frequently...</a>
01:15:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h15m59s">like when a kid starts to recognize his mom explicitly</a>
01:15:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h16m03s">'cause he or she knows the smell right away, pretty much, and the sound of the voice, but visually</a>
01:16:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h16m08s">if someone comes in and it isn't who the baby wants, so generally it isn't mom</a>
01:16:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h16m15s">the baby will start to cry, but it's not 'cause the baby's sad, generally, it's because it's angry that mom didn't show up</a>
01:16:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h16m21s">and that's an early sign of will, it's like this kid wants things</a>
01:16:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h16m26s">and it's perfectly willing to tell you about</a>
01:16:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h16m29s">and of course a two-year-old who's having a temper tantrum is in some sense doing the same thing</a>
01:16:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h16m34s">it's poorly integrated will and independence, obviously, but it certainly runs contrary to what you want</a>
01:16:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h16m40s">you don't want your two-year-old having a temper tantrum in the middle of the toy store</a>
01:16:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h16m43s">it's extraordinarily embarrassing for you and... well, for you, but it's also embarrassing for the two-year-old</a>
01:16:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h16m50s">this is one of the reasons I think that that sort of thing should be carefully socialized rapidly</a>
01:16:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h16m56s">because it's actually humiliating for the kid, 'cause other people don't like that</a>
01:16:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h16m59s">and they're very judgmental about it, they won't say anything, usually, but sometimes they will</a>
01:16:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h17m04s">but they're not happy about the fact that that's happening, and they will judge the child negatively</a>
01:17:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h17m09s">so you don't want your child to be behaving in a way in public that makes other people think badly of them</a>
01:17:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h17m16s">it's really, really not good, and so part of your job as a parent is to not expose your child to that sort of experience</a>
01:17:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h17m25s">especially not repeatedly, it's really hard on them</a>
01:17:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h17m29s">or they get narcissistic, which is also rally hard on them</a>
01:17:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h17m32s">it just takes a lot longer to manifest itself</a>
01:17:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h17m35s">so anyways, he's off on stage and Stromboli introduces him and talks about how wonderful this is going to be</a>
01:17:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h17m41s">and Pinokio comes out on stage with the strings on, and drops them</a>
01:17:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h17m45s">and then he falls down the steps and puts his nose into a hole, makes a fool out of himself</a>
01:17:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h17m49s">and that's the first time Stromboli shows his true character, 'cause he just really yells and screams at him</a>
01:17:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h17m56s">and he has his back to the audience, Stromboli, while he's doing this, so he's not noticing how the audience is reacting</a>
01:17:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h18m03s">typical tyrannical parent, right, who's not noticing that society is reacting a different way than him</a>
01:18:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h18m09s">he's not happy about it, and Pinokio of course is dazed and feels like a fool, and he is a fool</a>
01:18:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h18m15s">so that's appropriate; but then Stromboli hears the crowd laughing, and as soon as he turns around he's all smiles again</a>
01:18:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h18m23s">so that's the first time you get insight into what sort of puppet master he is</a>
01:18:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h18m27s">he's there to please the crowd and that's all, and he's there to look good in public, but fundamentally he's a tyrant</a>
01:18:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h18m33s">and I guess that's the problem with false celebrity, that the negative spirit of the crowd becomes your master</a>
01:18:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h18m41s">because to be a celebrity, you have to be a crowd pleaser, and if you're pleasing the kind of crowd who likes a celebrity like you</a>
01:18:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h18m47s">which is... and there's not much reason for that, then it's not exactly like you're appealing to the proper side of the crowd</a>
01:18:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h18m56s">and you've become its puppet one way or another, and maybe it's rewarding you with wealth, perhaps</a>
01:18:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h19m01s">and with attention, but fundamentally it's not something I would recommend</a>
01:19:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h19m08s">if you want to stay reasonably psychologically healthy for any reasonable amount of time; you're gonna sell yourself out</a>
01:19:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h19m15s">and I don't mean that in any casual way, you know</a>
01:19:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h19m19s">all right, so anyways, Stromboli changes from the tyrant to the good father in half a second</a>
01:19:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h19m25s">he gives Pinokio a pat on the head despite the fact that he's made a mistake, looks all kind</a>
01:19:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h19m30s">and the show continues; now, the cricket is not very happy about this</a>
01:19:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h19m34s">he's sitting in the stage, watching, he's very  angry and, let's say, disgusted by what's happening</a>
01:19:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h19m40s">partly because Pinokio is making a fool of himself; now that's an interesting thing</a>
01:19:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h19m45s">human beings blush, in fact, if I remember correctly, the name Adam, you know, like Adam and Eve</a>
01:19:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h19m54s">is related to the capacity to blush; now that comes from something I read a long time ago, and that might be wrong</a>
01:19:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h20m00s">but Adam does manifest shame in the sight of God, so there is a relationship there</a>
01:20:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h20m06s">but anyways, people do make foold of themselves for public display</a>
01:20:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h20m12s">and you can tell you've done that in some sense, not always, if you blush</a>
01:20:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h20m16s">because you've either said something you shoulnd't've and you realize that</a>
01:20:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h20m21s">which is more like you've tried to be funny and gone a little bit too far, and sometimes that can be really funny</a>
01:20:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h20m27s">or you've said something you know to be false, manipulative, deceitful, beneath you</a>
01:20:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h20m34s">any of those things, and you'll have an automatic response to it, you'll be ashamed and blush</a>
01:20:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h20m39s">one theory about that is you can trust people who blush, because you know that their conscience will betray them</a>
01:20:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h20m46s">and so that even if they are lying, they tell you; it's an interesting theory</a>
01:20:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h20m51s">because blush is definitely... like it's a facial display, it's right out there, where people can see it</a>
01:20:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h20m57s">you know, maybe that's true, maybe it isn't, but it's kind of an interesting idea</a>
01:20:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h21m02s">anyways, the cricket is not happy with what's going on, he's not happy about Stromboli</a>
01:21:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h21m05s">and he's not happy about the willingness of Pinokio to make a fool of himself to support this false celebrity</a>
01:21:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h21m12s">I actually think that's why celebrity types like that often get narcissistic and arrogant</a>
01:21:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h21m20s">it's because they aren't paying attention really to what's happening inside them, they drown it out</a>
01:21:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h21m29s">because the glory and the money, and all that is so attractive and enticing</a>
01:21:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h21m35s">they refuse to notice what price they're paying for it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h21m38s">and they magnify up their grandiosity and their arrogance to keep that stuff all under control</a>
01:21:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h21m43s">and then of course they get surrounded by sycophants, which is a really bad thing</a>
01:21:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h21m47s">they get surrounded by people who will tell them exactly what they wanna hear</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h21m52s">and that's really bad if what you wanna hear from other people is not good for you</a>
01:21:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h21m56s">to surround yourself with people who won't offer you genuine criticism, or even genuine reward, it's the same thing</a>
01:21:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h22m04s">you want from me that I differentially reward and punish you in approximately the way that the good part of the crowd will</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h22m11s">that's what you want from all your friends</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h22m14s">because then your interactions with them can generalize out to the broader community in a productive way</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h22m19s">and so a good friend... your friends tend to be on the supportive side, and perhaps that's appropriate</a>
01:22:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h22m25s">assuming there's reciprocity; but a good friend will also tell you when one way or another</a>

01:31:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h31m14s">I think you should assume "horrible book, bad response," because that's the most likely</a>
01:31:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h31m18s">of all four of those categories, that's the most likely to be true, purely on actuarial grounds, let's say</a>
01:31:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h31m26s">so, all right, so anyways, the cricket wanders away, because he obviously...</a>
01:31:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h31m31s">not only was he late for work that day, but he turned out to be wrong about everything</a>
01:31:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h31m35s">so he lets Pinokio go off on his adventure; and Stromboli puts him in this little touring wagon</a>
01:31:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h31m44s">and away they go; and the cricket thinks: "well, the consciensce isn't needed anymore on this journey towards unearned celebrity"</a>
01:31:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h31m54s">well, meanwhile, back at the ranch, as they say, the puppet is supposed to come home after school</a>
01:31:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h32m04s">but he doesn't, he doesn't show up</a>
01:32:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h32m12s">and the kitten, and the fish, and Gepetto are all waiting there for him, ready to eat</a>
01:32:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h32m20s">but he doesn't show up</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h32m26s">and so Gepetto goes out into the rain to look for him</a>
01:32:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h32m32s">and he can't find him; and then we see the inside of the traveling show cart</a>
01:32:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h32m40s">and Stromboli is having a snack, and counting all the money that he's made from tonight's performance</a>
01:32:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h32m47s">and hypothetically dividing it out with the puppet, so we've got this little stack of gold, and some of it's false</a>
01:32:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h32m54s">somebody paid with a... looks like a little washer, mechanical washer, and it's bent</a>
01:32:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h32m59s">and so he curses about that for a while, even though, it's interesting, eh, because he's made all this money</a>
01:32:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h33m05s">he's been really successful, but this one little error is enough to enrage him, which is very ungrateful and tyrannical</a>
01:33:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h33m13s">look, you got a hundred gold pieces, someone's slipped you a fake one</a>
01:33:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h33m21s">you could've had 101, it's still a pretty good day, all things considered</a>
01:33:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h33m25s">you know, you gotta make a bit of allowance for error, which is something a tyrant does not do</a>
01:33:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h33m29s">and that's perfect, because if you don't make allowance for error at all, then people are always guilty of something</a>
01:33:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h33m38s">and if you're a tyrant, that's exactly what you want; and people <em>are</em> always guilty of something</a>
01:33:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h33m44s">so the tyrant who is willing to exploit that is always on solid ground</a>
01:33:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h33m49s">anyways, he doesn't share with Pinokio</a>
01:33:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h33m56s">and he puts him in a bird cage, a jail, and he also shows him this other puppet that has an axe through him</a>
01:33:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h34m02s">that was the previous puppet, who didn't precisely perform as he was supposed to</a>
01:34:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h34m08s">so there's a big threat there, it's like: "you stay in that jail, you do exactly what I want</a>
01:34:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h34m14s">or it's off to the wood pile for you, to be burned"</a>
01:34:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h34m19s">well, that's just worth thinking about, 'cause that's kind of what happens with tyrants</a>
01:34:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h34m26s">and literally, not just metaphorically</a>
01:34:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h34m31s">so the cricket is basically wondering what in the world he should do</a>
01:34:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h34m40s">and then the cart rolls by, and he gets an inking or hears, I don't quite remember this</a>
01:34:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h34m44s">that Pinokio is in there, and might be in trouble, or he thinks that up, I'm sorry, I can't remember that</a>
01:34:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h34m50s">but he ends up inside the cart, he finds that traveling cart, and he goes inside</a>
01:34:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h34m54s">and then he tries to pick the lock, 'cause he's a bug, he can climb inside</a>
01:34:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h34m59s">he tries to pick the lock, he tries to get Pinokio out of the jail that he sort of collaborated himself into</a>
01:34:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h35m05s">it's interesting, because if you read, for example, if you read Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago</a>
01:35:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h35m12s">which I would highly recommend, one of the things you find is that if you were arrested by the  KGB</a>
01:35:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h35m22s">the secret police in the Soviet Union, and you were hauled off to a... like a tribunal, before a judge</a>
01:35:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h35m33s">they wanted you to admit that you were guilty, you had to, they'd torture you until you confessed</a>
01:35:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h35m41s">or you could just confess, and I always found that so mysterious</a>
01:35:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h35m46s">they kick down your door, they know perfectly well that they haven't got anymore on you than they've got on anyone else</a>
01:35:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h35m52s">and yet you have to go through the damn trial, and you have to admit that they're right</a>
01:35:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h35m57s">why do they even bother with that? why don't they just throw your sorry ass into the camp?</a>
01:35:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h36m02s">which is essentially what's gonna happen anyway; why do they need your collaboration?</a>
01:36:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h36m07s">you know, I never quite figured that out, I think it's partly because they're not willing to let you stand in opposition to the rules</a>
01:36:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h36m17s">because the mere fact that you'll do that means that you exist as something that is allowed to exist outside the rules</a>
01:36:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h36m24s">and they're not having any of that, so that's part of it</a>
01:36:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h36m30s">but there's more to it, there's more to it than that, it's like the drama of collaboration</a>
01:36:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h36m36s">one of the things I learned about societies like the Soviet Union, and this is true of all tyrannical societies</a>
01:36:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h36m41s">is that the idea that that's top-down, and that people are just following orders, they're good people, but they're just following orders</a>
01:36:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h36m47s">you can forget about that, that's a stupid theory</a>
01:36:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h36m50s">when a society becomes tyrannical like that, the tyranny exists at every single level of the society</a>
01:36:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h36m56s">you tyrannize your own conscience; so let's say you're a true believer in Marxist utopia, let's say</a>
01:36:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h37m03s">or a national socialist Third Reich, that's gonna last a thousand years and be racially pure, and you really believe that</a>
01:37:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h37m09s">and that's supposed to be a perfect state, and that's already been delivered to you</a>
01:37:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h37m14s">so what that means is that insofar as you're a true believer, your own suffering becomes heretical</a>
01:37:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h37m20s">because to the degree that you're suffering, you're living proof of the fact that the system is not delivering what it promised to deliver</a>
01:37:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h37m26s">and so you have to suppress that, you have to become your own tyrant, you can't admit that anything's gone wrong</a>
01:37:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h37m31s">and of course you can't talk about it to your family, because one out of three of them are government informers</a>
01:37:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h37m36s">just like one out of three of everyone, and you're certainly not going to mention it in the workplace</a>
01:37:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h37m41s">because unless you're a devout communist party member, you're not going anywhere</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h37m45s">and if any of your ancestors were land owners or bourgeoisie, you're done, you're done</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h37m54s">and then every single level of the bureaucracy is exactly the same as that, and on the top there's a tyrant</a>
01:37:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h38m00s">but the tyrant is everywhere, everywhere from the peak to the soul</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h38m04s">it's all tyranny, and everyone participates in that by lying about everything</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h38m10s">and that's why you see what happens next in the movie</a>
01:38:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h38m14s">Pinokio's in jail, and he's there because he was naive, and he allowed himself to be enticed</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h38m20s">and because he did something that would've run contrary to his conscience; but the movie does not put up straw men</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h38m26s">the poor damn puppet got tangled into this, his conscience wasn't even around, so you have to have some sympathy for him</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h38m44s">doesn't change the fact that he's in jail, and he can't get out</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h38m51s">I was watching Louis CK the other night, and he was talking about children lying</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h39m07s">because you're talking to someone whose head would scrape the roof, they weigh three times as much as you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h39m28s">and then you get a genius idea in your head; smarter children learn to lie earlier</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h39m35s">children with high IQs learn to lie younger; and CK says:</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h40m17s">and the blue fairy appears again from the star, same way</a>
01:40:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h40m21s">so what this means is, and I think this is right, this is something Jung talked about, it's also extraordinarily brilliant</a>
01:40:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h40m30s">he said that it's one thing to break a rule when you don't really know the rule</a>
01:40:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h40m36s">for whatever reason you seem to get a bit of a free pass for that</a>
01:40:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h40m41s">but if then you know the rule, and then you break it anyway, you get hit a lot harder</a>
01:40:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h40m47s">and I know that's true, and I even think I figured out why it was true at one point, but I can't remember at the moment</a>
01:40:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h40m53s">but there's something about... it's like the severity of the moral error isn't quite as massive if you're genuinely ingorant and unconscious about the rule</a>
01:40:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h41m03s">and maybe it's because you're not violating your own belief system as much when you engage in the misactivity</a>
01:41:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h41m09s">it's something like that</a>
01:41:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h41m13s">so Pinokio is in there, and he's partly at fault, at least because he's naive</a>
01:41:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h41m18s">and he's very desperate about it; but it's also because his conscience isn't functioning very well</a>
01:41:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h41m25s">so he has his reasons, and so whatever, the blue fairy shows up again, mother nature steps in</a>
01:41:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h41m31s">to aid him; and that is true, I would say, it's not like you get walloped</a>
01:41:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h41m39s">or killed every time you make a mistake, which is kinda interesting</a>
01:41:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h41m45s">and especially that's the case with kids, we have more leeway for them</a>
01:41:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h41m50s">whether nature does, that's a different issue, but I would say yes, because kids are really cute</a>
01:41:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h41m55s">and they're appealing, and they're naive, and they're kind of helpless, they have those motions even</a>
01:41:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h42m01s">that indicate helplessness, and that's associated with a natural apprehension of cuteness</a>
01:42:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h42m06s">cuteness is basically: big eyes, small nose, symmetrical features, baby-like features</a>
01:42:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h42m11s">helpless movements; that elicits sympathy and compassion, and it does it cross-species</a>
01:42:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h42m18s">and so does the cry; my roommate when I was in college had a niece who was quite young, about a year and a half old, I think</a>
01:42:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h42m27s">and we had a cat, a wild cat, it was a really fighty cat, partly because of me, because I would always play with it</a>
01:42:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h42m35s">and I let it fight with me quite a lot, so it was a fighty cat</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h42m40s">that little girl would come over, and you know, maybe she'd cry, and that cat was there right now, trying to figure out what was wrong</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h42m47s">the cat would use its claws on me, but it would never use its claws on the little kid</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h42m52s">and I thought, that's an indication of that cross-species cuteness</a>
01:42:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h42m57s">you're all attracted to that, more or less, and the more maternal you are, the more you're attracted to such things</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h43m08s">yeah, it is, it appeals to exactly this concomitation [sic][possibly meant combination] of infantile features</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h43m19s">and it brings out compassion unless you're psychopathic, so it's a good thing</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h43m26s">but it can be manipulated, that's for sure, women actually manipulate it with makeup</a>

01:43:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h43m45s">if you think of nature in the guise of their mother, for example, but even the biology of other people</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h43m56s">so nature will forgive; so she shows up in her heavenly guise, and says:</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h44m03s">"what's going on?" and Pinokio, again because he's naive, but also because he's not good</a>
01:44:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h44m09s">he's not evil either, he's neither or both, depends on how you look at it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h44m15s">he also has no idea how smart he is, and how smart he isn't, or how smart the person he's talking to is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h44m20s">and instead of admitting what he's done, he lies about it, and that's interesting</a>
01:44:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h44m26s">because it does suggest that he understands at some level that he set himself up for this</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h44m49s">a fictional monster; he could have told even three quarters of the truth and had it work, but he doesn't</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h45m19s">I think it was Mark Twain, Samuel Clemens, who said:</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h45m24s">"one of the advantages to telling the truth is that you don't have to remember what you said"</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h45m34s">there's a bunch of things that I learned as a clinician</a>
01:45:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h45m38s">and one of them is... 'cause you're often in really weird situations if you're a clinician</a>
01:45:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h45m43s">'cause things happen that don't happen normally, and you don't know what to do</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h45m47s">so what I've learned is I just say what's happening, whatever it is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h45m51s">regardless of what it is, I'll just try to describe it as accurately as I can</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h46m11s">because as soon as you lie you're aligned with the forces that are persecuting him</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h46m20s">in fact, you can make people paranoid by giving them enough amphetamines</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h51m15s">but the Rousseauian types often are very interesting when their kids hit teenage years</a>
01:51:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h51m21s">or when they're judging, say, criminal teenagers</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h51m31s">so they go from good to thug in one move; and you often see that in families, too</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h52m33s">so now Pinokio's gone free, he's been reunited with his conscience, he's learned a couple of lessons</a>
01:52:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h52m39s">1. don't be an actor, 2. and don't lie, and those things are quite similar</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h52m44s">and especially once you're caught in your actor trap, don't lie to get out, 'cause that will just make it worse</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h53m34s">one of the things Jung said about the shadow, and this is, I would say, one of the primary impediments to enlightenment</a>
01:53:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h53m41s">is that if you start looking at your motives for misbehaving, and I mean by that something very specific</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h53m54s">I mean: when you know by your own standards that you're doing something that devious or malevolent or underhanded</a>
01:53:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h54m01s">you know it, and you still do it, so it's your own judgment you're bringing to bear on yourself</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h54m12s">this is the motif of Dante's Inferno, fundamentally</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h54m17s">Dante's Inferno is a story about, I can't remember his name, unfortunately; might be Dante, in fact</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h54m25s">I don't remember; he's led into hell by Virgil, who is an ancient philosopher, thinker [he was a poet]</a>
01:54:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h54m33s">and hell has levels, so the outer level is... and this is a christianised version of hell, because there's hells of all sorts</a>
01:54:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h54m42s">but this is a christianised version; on the outermost levels of hell, which is sort of like normal life</a>
01:54:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h54m49s">are the ancient philosophers, and they're still in hell, because they weren't christian</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h54m53s">but it's like cheap motel hell instead of the full pit thing</a>
01:54:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h55m00s">so then Dante goes deeper and deeper into hell, until he gets right to the bottom of it</a>
01:55:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h55m06s">it's been a while since I read it, but if I remember correctly, Satan himself is encased in ice at the bottom of hell</a>

01:55:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h55m22s">was betrayal, they're in the deepest levels hell, and I really like that idea, I think it's true</a>
01:55:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h55m28s">because if you trust me, then you're manifesting the necessary courage that puts someone through life</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h56m09s">so it's a really terrible thing to do to someone, and maybe it's the worst thing, and that was Dante's idea</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h56m14s">and it's tied in... that makes very interesting reading, if you read it at the same time as Milton's Paradise Lost</a>
01:56:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h56m20s">because those metaphysical explorations, this is what they are, they're metaphysical explorations of the terrible places you can end up</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=01h56m42s">so you'll have your specific reasons, but under that there'll be some other reasons</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h08m09s">[student] so I was wondering how in morality you go from to who's strongest and who's weakest to what's good and what's bad</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h08m16s">oh yes, exactly; one of the things I really liked about this movie was it showed me why people watch wrestling</a>
02:08:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h08m22s">and I couldn't... because certainly they're not appealing...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h08m35s">and most people don't go to movies, and that actually... it really is because movies operate at a level of sophistication that is too high for many people</a>
02:08:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h08m45s">just like novels, hardly anyone reads; 15% of the population, might be 20%, cannot read well enough to follow written instructions</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h09m04s">and it is that high; but the archetype still needs to manifest itself on different levels</a>
02:09:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h09m12s">and so it manifests itself in wrestling; but even there, where it is physical force, it's not just physical force</a>
02:09:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h09m18s">it's a drama between good and evil, and you can see this so clearly in the Brett Hart documentary</a>

02:09:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h09m35s">maybe the bad wrestler brings two of his friends in, and they bring in chairs, and they bash the hell out of the good guy</a>
02:09:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h09m41s">and the whole audience is just outraged by this, and the documentary does a lovely job of showing that</a>
02:09:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h09m47s">so even at the level of physical combat, let's say, you can't reduce what's good to what's strong</a>
02:09:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h09m54s">it's just one element of it; better to be strong than to be weak</a>
02:09:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h09m58s">and so you can have strong hero, because it's better to be strong than to be weak</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h10m02s">but it's better to be strong and kind than to be strong</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h10m10s">and that's true not only in human beings, but it's even true, let's say, at the wolf or chimpanzee level</a>
02:10:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h10m17s">because one of the things you see with the chimp dominance hierarchies, and I think I mentioned this before</a>
02:10:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h10m22s">is if the leader, the dominant male, is really good at fostering social relations and being reciprocal in acts like grooming</a>
02:10:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h10m30s">and also paying attention to the females and their offspring, his dynasty will be much more stable</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h10m36s">and so, strong might be good for one battle, it might be good for two battles, but for 50 battles it's not optimized</a>
02:10:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h10m44s">especially because no matter how strong you are, someone can take you out</a>
02:10:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h10m49s">so what happens is the idea of what's ideal becomes increasingly complex across time, multifaceted</a>
02:10:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h10m58s">and so: strength, wisdom, intelligence, vision, all these things are amalgamated into a single being</a>
02:10:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h11m05s">and we'll talk a lot about that, because I wanna show you how that happened in Mesopotamia</a>
02:11:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h11m09s">because that's one of the first places where we have documentation about how that ideal emerged</a>
02:11:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h11m13s">they had a god called Marduk, and Marduk had 50 names</a>
02:11:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h11m17s">and as far as I can tell, the reason for that was that Marduk was an amalgam of the tribal deities of at least 50 tribes</a>
02:11:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h11m24s">and when the tribes were brought together, and civilized, each of their gods, who were ideals-</a>
02:11:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h11m31s">had to be amalgamated into something that was a single dramatized representation of value</a>
02:11:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h11m38s">or there was no way that all those people could have lived together</a>
02:11:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h11m41s">their different value structures would have fragmented them, and they would have stayed in a state of war</a>
02:11:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h11m46s">so the question is... it's the question you're asking: if it's not strength, then what is it?</a>
02:11:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h11m51s">well, strength is an element, but the Egyptians figured out that it was vision, it was actually the capacity to pay attention</a>
02:11:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h11m59s">that was paramount, and the Mesopotamians had that figured out more or less too</a>
02:11:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h12m04s">because their god Marduk had eyes all the way around his head, he could see everywhere</a>
02:12:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h12m08s">so seeing was a critical element of what should be on top, and the other thing for the Mesopotamians was the ability to speak</a>
02:12:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h12m15s">so by the time of Mesopotamia people had already dramatized the idea</a>
02:12:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h12m20s">that cardinal human attributes are vision and the ability to speak</a>
02:12:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h12m24s">and the ability to speak the truth, too, not just speak</a>
02:12:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h12m29s">other questions?</a>
02:12:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h12m32s">[student] so, I wasn't really aware of what you just said that most people don't watch movies</a>
02:12:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h12m40s">[student] because I've probably watched [unintelligible] so is that why we sort of consider... 'cause we were talking about celebrity career</a>
02:12:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h12m49s">[student] that different levels of abstraction of celebrity are respected more? like reality TV probably lower than ... Cumberbatch, than like a theater actor, then like a novelist</a>
02:12:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h13m01s">[Peterson] sure, yes, that's exactly why, because, you see</a>
02:13:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h13m06s">the less sophisticated the genre, the more the genre is like real life</a>
02:13:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h13m16s">and the more sophisticated it is, the more it has abstracted out across instances of real life the fundamental lessons</a>
02:13:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h13m26s">and that's what makes something profound and deep, it's abstracted from multiple sources</a>
02:13:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h13m31s">and it applies across multiple dimensions; 'cause that's what you want, and here is why</a>
02:13:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h13m37s">fundamentally, you have a problem, but that's not the problem, the problem is that there are problems</a>
02:13:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h13m46s">so the problem is a metaproblem: there are problems</a>
02:13:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h13m50s">you need a solution to that, that's not a solution to a problem, that's a metasolution to the class of problems</a>
02:13:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h13m58s">right, and that's what people have been trying to figure out ever since we were able to actually figure things out</a>
02:13:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h14m04s">it's not: "how do you solve a problem", it's: "how do you act so that you solve the problem of problems"</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h14m10s">and that's basically the complexity of life and the fact that you're mortal and vulnerable</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h14m16s">[student] so then a follow-up question, from your book you have this sort of strata</a>
02:14:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h14m22s">from play all the way up to religion and beyond that, sort of looking back retroactively with philosophy and rationality</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h14m43s">if you really wanna think this through, the best way to do that is to read Nietzsche and Dostoevsky at the same time</a>
02:14:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h14m48s">now, I'm sure there's other ways of doing this; but Nietzsche was actually quite heavily influenced by Dostoevsky</a>
02:14:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h14m53s">more than people knew, although their thought runs very parallel</a>
02:14:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h14m57s">Dostoevsky is like the ultimate dramatist, he embodies his ideas, and he has them act out in a dramatic space</a>
02:14:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h15m05s">it's literary; whereas Nietzsche has taken that up one level of abstraction, to the semantic</a>
02:15:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h15m10s">he says: "well, here's what's going on" in an articulated way, but he doesn't embody it in a story</a>
02:15:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h15m15s">and you might say: "well, that's higher", but it's only higher in a way</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h15m19s">it's more abstract in that it's more like words</a>
02:15:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h15m23s">whereas what Dostoevsky does is half words and half images</a>
02:15:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h15m27s">because when you read a novel what happens is that... people say,  postmodernists say: "where the hell is the meaning in that novel?"</a>
02:15:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h15m34s">it's not in the word, it's not in the phrase, it's not in the sentence, it's not in the paragraph, where do you localize the meaning?</a>
02:15:34</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h15m45s">but what happens partly when you're reading a book, a novel, is that the words trigger representations in your imagination</a>
02:15:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h15m55s">a lot of what you extract the information from is actually your imagistic representation of the words</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us979jCjHu8#t=02h18m46s">so what happens is the proclivity to emerge at the top of the set of dominance hierarchies</a>
