<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h00m03s">Right. Indisputable.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h00m07s">What do you do about that?</a>
00:00:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h00m10s">You... you voluntarily accept it,</a>
00:00:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h00m13s">and then strive to overcome the suffering, that's a consequence of that.</a>
00:00:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h00m19s">And... you do that for you, and you do that in a way, that makes it better for other people.</a>
00:00:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h00m23s">And then - that works.</a>
00:00:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h00m25s">And, one question might be:
"Well, how well does it work?"</a>
00:00:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h00m28s">And the answer is: you-
The only way that you can find out, is by trying it.</a>
00:00:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h00m34s">That's it, that's the existential element of it.</a>
00:00:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h00m36s">The proof is to be derived, by the incarnation of the attitude in your own life.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h00m53s">Because you can't do this without commitment.
You have to commit to it first,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h00m57s">that's the act of faith, that Kierkegaard was so insistent upon.</a>
00:00:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h01m02s">You have to say: "I'm going to act, as if being is good".</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h01m05s">"I'm going to act, as if truth is the pathway to enlightenment".</a>

00:01:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h01m13s">And there's- there's reasons to do none of those.</a>
00:01:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h01m16s">They're real reasons. So it's really a decision.</a>
00:01:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h01m20s">But - you can't find out what the consequence of the decision is, unless you make the decision.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h01m24s">I think the same thing happens, when you get married by the way, it's that...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h01m27s">If you think you might leave, you're not married.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h01m31s">And then, you think: "Well, the marriage didn't succeed".
It's like, "Well, maybe you were never married".</a>
00:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h01m35s">Because, the rule is: You don't get to leave.</a>
00:01:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h01m38s">And there's a reason for that rule.</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h01m40s">Now, I'm not saying that there aren't situations, where there should be exceptions made for that. That's not the point.</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h01m45s">The point is, that there's some games you don't get to play, unless you're all in.</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h01m50s">And y- the other thing, that's so interesting about being alive, is that you're all in</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h01m56s">No matter what you do - you're all in, this is gonna kill you.</a>
00:01:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h02m01s">So, I think you might as well play the most magnificent game you can, while you're waiting.</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h02m06s">Because - do you have anything better to do? Really?</a>
00:02:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h02m11s">Why not pick the best thing possible, that you could do?</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h02m15s">Why not do that? Maybe you could justify your wretched existence to yourself that way.</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h02m19s">I think you could! That's what it looks like.</a>
00:02:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h02m22s">You know, people find such meaning in the responsibilities they adopt,</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h02m26s">it stops making them ask questions about what life is for.</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h02m29s">If you have a newborn child, for example,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h02m32s">(like, unless you're really in a bad way -</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h02m47s">And, if someone comes along, and asks you an existential question about your commitment to that,</a>
00:02:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h02m52s">the right response is: "Why are you asking me such stupid questions,</a>

00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h03m02s">That isn't a time for- for questions about the meaning of life.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h03m05s">The answer is right in front of you.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h03m07s">And if you can't see it, it's not because life has no meaning, it's because you're blind!</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h03m20s">Here's an answer.
It's like, "well, I'm going to criticize that".</a>

and- and see how far you get.</a>
00:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h03m58s">So, I thought - to bring full closure to the class - I was trying to solve</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h04m04s">this terrible puzzle, that confronted me for- and many other people,</a>
00:04:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h04m10s">about how it was, that human beings got themselves in such a tangle, about what they believed?</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h04m15s">Such a tangle, that we were pointing the ultimate weapons of destruction at one another.</a>
00:04:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h04m20s">Which by the way, we are still doing.</a>
00:04:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h04m24s">I thought "Okay well, I understand that. We need our belief systems, they orient us".</a>
00:04:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h04m29s">And, that means there will be conflict between belief systems, and that can be a catastrophe;</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h04m34s">and that's being played out everywhere - again, in very many ways.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h04m38s">What's the solution to that?</a>
00:04:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h04m39s">Well, one possibility is [that] there's no solution.</a>
00:04:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h04m42s">It's just... mayhem all the way around.
[It] could be the case.</a>
00:04:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h04m47s">But it seemed to me, as I delved into it, that the proper solution to that was to live properly.</a>
00:04:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h04m53s">As an individual. Because you're more powerful than you think.</a>
00:04:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h04m57s">Way more powerful than you think. I mean, God only knows what you are, in the final analysis.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h05m02s">You're blind to your own weaknesses,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h05m06s">And so, then I think: Well, if you've got your act together, it'd be better for you,</a>
00:05:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h05m10s">and instantly, it would be better for your family - assuming they wanted you to get your act together.</a>
00:05:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h05m14s">And not everyone does, but...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h05m16s">And then, it would be better for the community.
It's like, how far could you take that?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h05m19s">If you stopped wasting time, and if you stopped lying,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h05m36s">So, that's what I think you should do.</a>
00:05:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h05m39s">You should find out.</a>
00:05:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h05m41s">You don't have anything better to do.
And there's nothing in it, as far as I've been able to tell,</a>
00:05:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h05m44s">there's nothing in it, but good.</a>
00:05:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h05m49s">So...</a>
00:05:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h05m51s">Maybe you could... sort yourself out, so that you wanted nothing but the good.</a>
00:05:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h05m56s">And...</a>
00:05:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h05m57s">and then maybe you could help make that manifest in the world.</a>
00:05:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h05m59s">And...</a>
00:05:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h06m01s">maybe we wouldn't have all these terrible problems then.</a>
00:06:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h06m04s">At least we'd have fewer of them, and that would be a start.</a>
00:06:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h06m07s">So...</a>
00:06:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h06m09s">[stutter]</a>
00:06:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h06m10s">The answer to the problem of humanity, is that- is the...
is the integrity of the individual.</a>
00:06:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h06m18s">That's the answer.</a>
00:06:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h06m21s">So.</a>
00:06:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h06m22s">And states, that are predicated on that realization, are healthy.</a>
00:06:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h06m26s">So... and states that aren't, are doomed to stagnation, and catastrophic collapse.</a>
00:06:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h06m33s">And...</a>
00:06:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h06m34s">Personalities, that are predicated on...</a>
00:06:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h06m38s">self-tyranny and the tyranny of others, are doomed, and...</a>
00:06:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h06m43s">doomed to collapse.</a>
00:06:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h06m45s">So...</a>
00:06:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h06m46s">And then, you think: "Well, what's the barrier?"
And the barrier is: "Are you willing to accept the responsibility?"</a>
00:06:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h06m52s">And part of the answer to that is:
reduce the damn responsibility, until it's tolerable.</a>
00:06:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h06m56s">You don't have to fix everything at once.
You could just start by fixing the things, that you could fix.</a>
00:06:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h07m02s">Y- or you could even do it more...</a>
00:07:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h07m07s">You can do it with even less self-sacrifice. You can start by fixing only the things that you wanna fix.</a>
00:07:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h07m12s">God you can get a massive way that way.</a>
00:07:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h07m15s">So... do it! See what happens.</a>
00:07:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h07m18s">That's what you should have been taught in university, right from the beginning.</a>
00:07:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h07m21s">It's like, aim at the highest good!
Tool yourself into something, that can attain it.</a>
00:07:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h07m26s">And go out there, and manifest it in the world.</a>
00:07:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h07m29s">And everything, that-
everything, that comes your way will be...</a>
00:07:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h07m34s">Everything, that comes your way, will be a blessing.
And so...</a>
00:07:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h07m40s">All you have to do, is give up your resentment and your hatred.</a>
00:07:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h07m43s">I know that's a hard thing to give up,
because you have plenty of reason for it.</a>
00:07:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h07m50s">That's probably a good place to stop.</a>
00:07:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpuxiV-_Es#t=00h07m52s">So... it's been a pleasure.</a>
