...It's really useful, to not defend yourself too vociferously.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KgCqGtXqFc#t=00h00m05s">Which is weird, cause you'd think: "Well, you have

00:00:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KgCqGtXqFc#t=00h00m51s">- there's a line in the New Testament,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KgCqGtXqFc#t=00h01m04s">Well, there's a couple of problems,

not defend yourself, like weakly!</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KgCqGtXqFc#t=00h01m14s">You can't be weak and not defend yourself

Yeah, so to that point, do you think that we sometimes actually, at a deep level,</a>
00:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KgCqGtXqFc#t=00h01m58s">use identity politics against ourselves, in this regard?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KgCqGtXqFc#t=00h02m08s">Because had it been a male, you know,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KgCqGtXqFc#t=00h02m11s">and you talk about this often, that we have to act differently towards males and females,</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KgCqGtXqFc#t=00h02m15s">and there's physical reasons for that,
and biological reasons for that...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KgCqGtXqFc#t=00h02m18s">But that had she been a male, say,
the same exact age from you, from Alberta,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KgCqGtXqFc#t=00h02m55s">There's a physical limit, that's much more stringent.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KgCqGtXqFc#t=00h02m59s">Right? I mean, there's a level of...
hinting at physical threat,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KgCqGtXqFc#t=00h03m04s">that you can bring to bear

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KgCqGtXqFc#t=00h03m15s">and it's especially challenging in an intellectual discussion,</a>
