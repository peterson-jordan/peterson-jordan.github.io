I mean</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h02m43s">Often if I'm reading a book if it has any utility at I'll mark it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h02m48s">Usually I fold over the top of the page or sometimes put a yellow sticky note on it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h02m52s">If I find a place where there's an idea that's worth returning to that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h02m59s">That's particularly worth understanding</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h03m01s">you can't do that with a book like Beyond good  evil because what ends up happening is you have to mark every sentence </a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h03m07s">Obviously marking every sentence isn't any better than not marking any sentences at all</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h03m12s">so</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h03m23s">I guess I al might as well tell you why it is worth bothering with a book like this at all</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h03m29s">Because it's a very difficult book, and it's also the sort of book that will rattle you up.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h03m34s">So Nietzsche is very interested in the problem of value and the problem of value fundamentally is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h03m42s">not the problem of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h04m00s">People act towards aims in a sense because we're active creatures, and we're moving from one point to another</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h04m07s">we're moving towards things that we want and that means that we're guided by our desires and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h04m24s">Consists of how those desires are related to one another</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h04m28s">So for example if you have a room full of people</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h04m32s">Say a room full of children</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h04m39s">But at some point they may choose to organize themselves into a game</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h04m43s">And if they organize themselves into a game what they're doing for all intents and purposes is producing a little Society</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h04m55s">What desires will be currently expressed and how they'll exist in relationship to one another and that means that they can cooperate?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h38m21s">Without introducing the metaphorical conception of something that lives and so hardly what Nietzsche reveals in those sentences is that he</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h38m48s">Demons are things that have their own autonomous will and the generally aren't aiming for the good</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h38m54s">So then so those are all things Nietzsche just lays out as implicit parts of the sentence so he activates all those ideas</a>
00:38:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h39m01s">whether you know it or not in your mind to the degree that you process the sentence and those things start to take on a</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h39m13s">Then he adds another dimension of complexity to that by saying well</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h39m42s">from a narrative point of view or from a symbolic point of view in</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h39m48s">old stories in folk tales and Fairy Tales you often have</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h39m53s">cyclops, they're one-eyed giants, and there's a sexual connotation to that</a>
00:39:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h40m00s">which is our proposed that the psychoanalysts would would certainly point out</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h40m05s">But the one eye idea is that this thing is gigantic who wants one thing</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h40m12s">And so that's another way that Nietzsche is conceptualizing the fundamental</a>
00:40:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h40m20s">Structure of the human psyche it's a dwelling place full of one-eyed giants</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h40m25s">And they're constantly. well one thing one way of looking at is,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h40m35s">And then one of the things that so Nietzsche takes that argument further he says not only is this always happening in human beings</a>
00:40:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h40m42s">But that if you look at Philosophy what it is, is it's a continual</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h41m53s">What should that singular value be and then?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h41m56s">Nietzsche would that ties it the whole argument back into the first sentences that he wrote at the beginning of the paragraph which is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCOw0eJ84d8#t=00h42m09s">That's another way of looking at it</a>
