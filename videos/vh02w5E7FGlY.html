<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h01m09s">because average differences in IQ scores have existed for decades.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h02m32s">Among adolescents mostly, so well as kids as well</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h02m36s">Antisocial behavior is very persistent, so if you have a child whose conduct disordered at the age of four</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h02m42s">the probability that they will be criminal at the age of fifteen or twenty is extremely high, it's</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h02m48s">Unbelievably stable. It's a very dismal literature, because you see these early onset</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h02m53s">aggressive kids and,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h02m55s">And it's persistent, and then you look at the intervention literature,</a>
00:02:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h02m59s">And you throw up your hands because no interventions work. And believe me</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h03m04s">Psychologists have tried everything you could possibly imagine, and a bunch of things that you can't in order to ameliorate that.</a>
00:03:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h03m10s">So we're really interested in trying to</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h03m13s">Understand, for example, if you're antisocial by the age of four then there isn't an intervention that seems to be effective.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h03m20s">So, and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h03m21s">The standard penological theory is really quite</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h03m25s">Horrifying in this regard because what you see is that male aggression peaks around the age of 15</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h03m30s">And then it declines fairly precipitously and- and and sort of normalizes again by the age of 27 and standard phenological theory</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h03m38s">Essentially is this cold-hearted.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h03m39s">It's like, if you have a mult- if you have someone who's a multiple offender, you just throw them in prison till they're 27.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h03m45s">And then they age out of it and</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h03m48s">That's all there is to it. That's that's what we've got. Now,</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h03m52s">There's some downside to that because there's a corollary literature that suggests that the worst thing that you can do with antisocial people is to</a>
00:03:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h03m58s">Group them together, which is what we do in prisons so so that's a whole mess. Anyways,</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h04m03s">One of the things we were doing was trying to see if there might be cognitive</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h04m09s">And so we used this battery of neuropsychological tests that was put together at the Montreal Neurological Institute</a>
00:04:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h04m15s">Took about 11 hours to administer, and hypothetically assess prefrontal cortical function</a>
00:04:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h04m21s">We computerized that and reduced it to about ninety minutes and then</a>
00:04:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h04m26s">assessed antisocial</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h04m28s">Adolescents in- in Montreal, and found out that they did show deficits in the problem-solving ability that we associated with</a>
00:04:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h04m35s">with prefrontal ability. Uhm...</a>
00:04:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h04m38s">When I got to Harvard I thought well, that's interesting</a>
00:04:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h04m42s">We could use the neuro psych battery to predict negative behavior perhaps</a>
00:04:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h04m47s">we could use it to predict positive behavior? So I thought; Well, what if we turned the neuropsych battery and</a>
00:04:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h04m54s">Over and thought well can we predict grades, for example, because you know that's a decent thing to predict so we ran a study</a>
00:04:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h05m01s">we ran a study that looked at Harvard kids, University of Toronto kids, line workers at a Milwaukee factory and</a>
00:05:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h05m08s">Managers and executives at the same Factory, and what we found was that</a>
00:05:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h05m14s">Average score across se neuropsychological tests- They were kind of like games</a>
00:05:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h05m18s">They were game-like you know so in one in one</a>
00:05:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h05m21s">Test you had there were five lights in the middle of the screen and a box was associated with each light</a>
00:05:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h05m27s">And you had to learn by trial and error which box was associated with with each light. That was one of the tests</a>
00:05:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h05m32s">So... So,</a>
00:05:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h05m35s">We took people's average score across the tests because they seemed to clump together into a single</a>
00:05:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h05m41s">Structure. You can do- you can find that out statistically- if you take a bunch of tests you can find out how they clump together</a>
00:05:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h05m47s">Statistically by looking at their patterns of correlations, and you might get multiple clumps</a>
00:05:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h05m51s">Which is what happens with personality research where you get five or you might get a singular clump-</a>
00:05:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h05m56s">which is what happens in cognitive research, and we got a single clump essentially. And then we were trying to figure out if</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h06m03s">at the same time I was reading the literature on performance prediction and</a>
00:06:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h06m07s">There's an extensive literature on performance prediction, a lot of it generated by the Armed Forces, by the way,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h06m13s">Indicating that IQ is a very good predictor of long-term life success, and so here's that here's the general rule</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h06m21s">If your job is simple, which means you do the same thing every day, then IQ predicts how fast you'll learn the job</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h06m27s">But not how well you you do it, but if your job is complex?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h06m30s">Which means that the demands change on an ongoing basis- Then the best predictor of success is general cognitive ability. And, uh...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h06m38s">And I learned that the general cognitive ability test clumped together into a single factor</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h09m10s">conservatives think there's a job for everyone if people just get off their asses and get to work and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h09m14s">Liberals think while you can train anyone to do anything, it's like</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h09m17s">No! There isn't a job for everyone, and no you can't train everyone to do everything.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h09m22s">That's wrong.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h09m23s">And here's one of the consequences of that.</a>
00:09:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h09m26s">So, as I mentioned the Armed Forces has done a lot of work on IQ and they started back in</a>
00:09:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h09m31s">1919, and the reason they did that was because, well, for obvious reasons, say let's say there's a war and</a>
00:09:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h09m38s">You want to get qualified people into the officer positions as rapidly as possible, or you'll lose.</a>
00:09:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h09m44s">So that's a reason.</a>
00:09:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h09m46s">Now the Armed Forces has experimented with IQ test since 1919 and in the last 20 years</a>
00:09:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h09m53s">A law was passed as a consequence of that analysis</a>
00:09:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h09m57s">Which was that it was illegal to induct anyone into the Armed Forces who had an IQ of less than 83</a>
00:09:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h10m03s">Now the question is why and the answer was</a>
00:10:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h10m06s">all of that effort put in by the armed forces</a>
00:10:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h10m09s">Indicated that if you had an IQ of 83 or less there wasn't anything that you could be trained to do in the military that</a>
00:10:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h10m14s">Wasn't positively counterproductive. Now you got to think about that, because the military is chronically desperate for people.</a>
00:10:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h10m22s">Right? There- It's not like they're it's not like people are lining up to be inducted, right?</a>
00:10:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h10m27s">They have to go out and recruit.</a>
00:10:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h10m28s">And it's not easy and so they're desperate to get their hands on every body they can possibly manage and then especially in wartime</a>
00:10:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h10m35s">but also in peacetime</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h10m36s">But then there was another reason to which was the Armed Forces was also set up from a policy perspective to take</a>
00:10:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h10m43s">people in the underclass</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h10m44s">let's say, and</a>
00:10:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h10m45s">Train them and move them up at least into the working class or maybe the middle class, so there's a policy element to it</a>
00:10:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h10m50s">too, and so even from that perspective you could see that the military is desperate to bring people in</a>
00:10:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h10m56s">But yeah, well, with an IQ of 83 or less it's not happening.</a>
00:10:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h11m00s">Okay, so how many people have an IQ of 83 or less?</a>
00:11:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h11m05s">10%.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h11m11s">If that doesn't hurt you to hear</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h11m14s">Then you didn't hear it properly. Because what it implies is that in a complex society like ours, and one that's becoming increasingly</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h13m32s">Complex the problem is. First of all, we should point out that race is a very difficult thing to define because racial boundaries aren't tight.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h16m46s">Because men are more interested in things and women are more interested in people and you might say, ''Well, that's</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h17m21s">It's one standard deviation, which is about the same difference, by the way, between the population norm and the Ashkenazi Jews.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h17m49s">An answer to that- is best place to look at that- is in Sweden where the egalitarian policies have been laid out for a long</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h19m08s">It's not easy to make them go away. You can say ''Well, the tests aren't culture fair.'' Well, Here's a test of that so imagine you you test Group A with an IQ test and you test Group B with an IQ test</a>
00:19:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h19m20s">and then you look at their actual performance in whatever you're predicting.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h19m25s">If the test was biased against ethnic group A, then it would under predict their performance, and that doesn't happen.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY#t=00h19m33s">Now you could say ''Well, there's systemic bias in the performance measures and the potential measures'', and that's a possibility</a>
