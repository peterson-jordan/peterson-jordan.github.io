00:00:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h00m06s">Because meaning struggles with suffering</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h00m08s">And even more than that! If you live a meaningful life ... this means - of necessity - that you assume responsibility ...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h00m16s">So if you address people starting from the bottom of hell they are in, saying:</a>
00:00:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h00m20s">No wonder you are desperate, given our limitations and limitations ..</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h00m44s">And people understand that!</a>
00:00:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h00m46s">Therefore, it is not just a call to improve conditions. It is not an invitation to an ideal arising from the human imagination</a>
00:00:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h00m54s">Rather ..</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h00m58s">Rather, it is a kind of insistence that a person, without proper dealing with the truth, his life will decline and he will find himself resentful of life and stuck in some kind of hell</a>

00:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h01m29s">I am not a traditional psychologist in this regard because psychologists usually pat people on their heads and say, "You're fine as you are."</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h01m37s">I spoke with the Bishop (Baron) a while ago and he told me that Catholic priests were trained to be more accepting and inclusive - I mean humane -</a>

00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h02m06s">You want them to expand, develop, and fulfill themselves</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h02m11s">So..</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h02m14s">Instead of telling young people that they are fine as they are, I tell them ...</a>
00:02:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h02m19s">It is a difficult message for them if they are desperate</a>
00:02:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h02m23s">Let's say that 10% of my followers are young ... let's say they are young men. Just for example</a>
00:02:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h02m30s">And they are not in good condition</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h02m32s">They do not have deep goals</a>
00:02:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h02m34s">They drink a lot and always watch porn</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h02m38s">No goal, and no constants in their lives</a>
00:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h02m41s">In short, you find them miserable in their lives</a>
00:02:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h02m43s">Misery commends them that their hearts be filled with frustration</a>
00:02:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h02m47s">Because enough misery would definitely do that to you</a>
00:02:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h02m51s">What do you do then? You will come and say ..</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h02m53s">Are you okay as you are ??!</a>
00:02:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h02m56s">This is the last thing they need to hear</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h02m58s">But the correct message is: “Get hold of yourself, man</a>
00:02:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h03m01s">There is something you have to do ... and some of it will be difficult</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h03m04s">And here - in my opinion - lies a Christian message loudly ... and it is as follows.</a>
00:03:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h03m08s">To bear the weight of your suffering ... of your own free will ... and go up the hill with it</a>
00:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h03m14s">This not only gives you the meaning you need in your life so that you do not get seriously degraded.</a>
00:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h03m22s">It just gets better too</a>
00:03:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h03m25s">This is an integral part of the human journey!</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h03m27s">I believe in human ingenuity! And I think we can solve all the problems that we encounter</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h03m32s">And the matter cannot be limited to ..</a>
00:03:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h03m35s">It has to go deeper than our ability to materially improve our condition</a>
00:03:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h03m39s">As it looks now. And this is not enough.</a>
00:03:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h03m43s">life is tough..</a>
00:03:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h03m45s">It is a solid process!</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h03m48s">It is true!</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h03m50s">No wonder they think so! well, okay.</a>
00:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h03m53s">First, we'll take it seriously! Yes! You live a life of suffering and disorientation, and you have your reasons!</a>
00:03:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h03m59s">You also have to take these reasons seriously and say: "Despite these reasons ... my potential is greater than I think!"</a>
00:03:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h04m09s">You know that too, and the credibility of that is that you are rebuking yourself for not realizing that potential in you</a>
00:04:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h04m14s">For example, I sometimes ask people: "Give me the name of a character whom you admire and respect."</a>
00:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h04m19s">Because this inclination to admire and respect is linked to your instinct to imitate</a>
00:04:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h04m25s">Do you respect and admire people who are totally irresponsible? Or people who can't even take care of themselves?</a>
00:04:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h04m31s">Here is his role model</a>
00:04:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h04m34s">A person useless to himself, and you may even find him an enemy for himself! It is a disaster for his family, and you may also find him a threat to his community</a>
00:04:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h04m43s">No one admires such a character!</a>
00:04:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h04m46s">Start with the bare minimum! Can you at least take care of yourself? this is the beginning.</a>
00:04:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h04m52s">After that, have you reached a situation where someone else can rely on you from time to time? Number of people maybe? Maybe your family?</a>
00:04:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h05m01s">Maybe you can be the link that keeps them connected?</a>
00:05:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h05m06s">And then you may be worthy of something greater than that. You may be a host to your community. And God alone knows how much you can give in this area</a>
00:05:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h05m13s">This is how the characters worthy of admiration! So try this route and see what happens. Start with yourself!</a>
00:05:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h05m19s">Carl Jung said - and this is one of his best quotes for me -:</a>
00:05:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h05m23s">Modern man does not see God because he refuses to look between his sides</a>
00:05:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h05m27s">I really like this description.</a>
00:05:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h05m29s">Therefore, I address the same letter to the people I talk to, and it is as follows ..</a>
00:05:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h05m34s">You have a limited amount of potential within your ability framework</a>
00:05:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h05m40s">You may find this amount insulting, because you thirst for much greater than it</a>
00:05:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h05m44s">That is, you see this little of the potential that you possess is less than your level, so do not do anything with it, and by this you do not harvest anything</a>
00:05:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h05m54s">But if you take it seriously, humble yourself and work on the little things that need work, so you can distract yourself.</a>
00:05:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h06m01s">In the right ways, which may be humble and embarrassing, but it is real</a>
00:06:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h06m07s">And if you do this enough, you will vaccinate yourself. And you will see the result</a>
00:06:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h06m14s">You know, one of the things that have been tremendously encouraging for me ... which is really strange</a>
00:06:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h06m19s">Usually, when I go out now in the daytime, in which city I was .. I have visited about 150 cities so far in the past year.</a>
00:06:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h06m28s">And if I walk on the street or at an airport, someone comes to me every 10 minutes or so</a>
00:06:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h06m34s">And he tells me the same thing, they all say the same!</a>
00:06:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h06m37s">First, they apologize for inconveniencing me and find them a point in literature</a>
00:06:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h06m41s">People interacted with me .. you would not expect that based on my reputation in the media .. but people's interaction with me in public is incredibly positive.</a>
00:06:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h06m50s">And often a person interprets me from them saying:</a>
00:06:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h06m53s">“I was in a little swamp of Hell a year or 6 months ago</a>
00:06:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h06m58s">Whatever this swamp is; Addiction, drinking, conflict with parents, I lived with my girlfriend for 5 years and we were stuck, I had no direction in my career, I was nihilism, etc.</a>
00:06:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h07m11s">She knows the myriad of paths people can take that lead them to fall into a pit of misery</a>
00:07:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h07m18s">Then he says, "I have read your book, listened to your lectures, and decided that I will try to reunite my family."</a>
00:07:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h07m24s">"I will create a vision for myself that I seek to fulfill" or "that I will try to tell the truth" or "that I will try to do any of these things!"</a>
00:07:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h07m31s">"The situation has improved dramatically, tremendously!"</a>
00:07:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h07m35s">Sometimes you find him as a father and son, sometimes brother and sister, and sometimes a girl and her lover,</a>
00:07:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h07m41s">Usually the girl is very happy that her boyfriend has noticeably straightened</a>
00:07:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h07m46s">Perhaps they will marry with her boyfriend at least semi-civilized today, but it is very positive to see this transformation</a>
00:07:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h07m57s">And it is real!</a>
00:07:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h08m00s">It's very interesting to see that all it takes is some of these things</a>
00:08:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h08m07s">And suddenly, that little of the potential they had, it begins to expand and grow because they're humble enough to handle it right.</a>
00:08:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h08m14s">I believe therefore .. and I believe that it is an essential part of the Christian message .. which is that there is no limit to this expansion .. because we are a mixture of this strange mixture of the infinite and the infinite.</a>
00:08:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h08m28s">It is clear that we are connected with the infinite in some way .. because the infinite exists and thus .. here we are!</a>
00:08:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h08m34s">And so we are attached to it in some way, and I don't know how that connection, and so I don't know its limits.</a>
00:08:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h08m39s">If we asked ... if you were really in your best possible state as a human being, if you decided to live in pursuit of the truth and committed to it and mean good, and you would give your full capacity to that, as if the fate of your life depends on that, because the fate of your life depends on something. What could it be?</a>
00:08:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h08m58s">And nobody knows! But you know very well that you can be more than you are today, and you do not know the limits of your development. Certainly, we do not know the limits of possible development if many people did like that!</a>
00:08:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h09m09s">God alone knows the problems that we can solve.</a>
00:09:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h09m12s">Yes, there is so much suffering and misery in the world, so much of it, it is no wonder that people are bitter. But, as you previously mentioned, it was astonishing how much human ingenuity and potential we have in the world.</a>
00:09:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJlTeQJJsAU#t=00h09m23s">And if we are serious about making things less bad than they are, God knows best about the miracles we can do.</a>
