00:00:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h00m09s">Last time we talked about Carl Rogers as a phenomenologist</a>
00:00:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h00m16s">We started our brief exploration of the ideas behind the phenomenology, but now we're going back in time</a>
00:00:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h00m21s">to talk about the end of the nineteenth century,</a>
00:00:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h00m26s">and we will discuss Nietzsche, Dostoevsky and Kierkegaard a little more closely,</a>
00:00:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h00m33s">and the reason is because those three men</a>
00:00:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h00m38s">(in my opinion more than anyone in the nineteenth century) laid the foundation, not only for psychoanalysis</a>
00:00:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h00m44s">and then personality psychology and clinical psychology, but described them</a>
00:00:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h00m50s">also the broader social, political and cultural situation in which modern man finds itself today,</a>
00:00:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h00m57s">and their ideas are extraordinarily refined and well worth understanding,</a>
00:00:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h01m06s">because if you are able ... we deal with these personality theories one by one,</a>
00:01:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h01m12s">and we explore biology and neuropsychology, you need an underlying structure.</a>
00:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h01m21s">You need an understanding of an underlying structure to give everything a place,</a>
00:01:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h01m24s">in order to be able to understand it better ... ideas develop historically,</a>
00:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h01m31s">an idea is like a seed,</a>
00:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h01m37s">From a seed other plants grow, and the plant grows and gets branches.</a>
00:01:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h01m40s">If you go back to the starting point, you can often better understand the entire structure,</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h01m45s">and these three men, they are so brilliant it is a pleasure to learn their way of thinking,</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h01m54s">although it is very debilitating, really.</a>
00:01:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h02m01s">We'll start with this diagram that you can remember.</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h02m09s">Think about it from Piaget's perspective, as we explained that the child “puts themselves together”</a>
00:02:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h02m14s">by practicing micro-routines (motor micro-routines) that are accompanied by perception frames,</a>
00:02:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h02m22s">and also be integrated into a motivation system because they are motivated actions,</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h02m27s">and the child practices that</a>
00:02:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h02m34s">align micro-personalities,</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h02m39s">to create increasingly complex and increasingly integrated macro personalities.</a>
00:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h02m44s">That's what this diagram shows</a>
00:02:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h02m48s">We look at it from an adult's point of view,</a>
00:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h02m55s">so if you want to be a good person, you can divide “being a good person” into parts,</a>
00:02:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h03m00s">being a good person is an abstract ideal, but as you move closer to the point where goodness is manifested in action,</a>
00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h03m07s">you get closer to concrete actions in the world.</a>
00:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h03m14s">So the abstract category of “good person” actually consists of ...</a>
00:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h03m19s">you can see it as a complex melody of motor actions and perceptions,</a>
00:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h03m25s">and perception is closely related to motor action because when you perceive something,</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h03m29s">you do that in part by actively exploring the world.</a>
00:03:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h03m31s">Partly that's why your eyes are always moving,</a>
00:03:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h03m34s">and that your head moves when you listen, and if you want to touch something you must actively examine it,</a>
00:03:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h03m38s">so it is always an activity of exploration.</a>
00:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h03m41s">When you think about how the child “assembles” themselves step by step</a>
00:03:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h03m50s">can you see that as a biological process unfolding,</a>
00:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h03m56s">the child who crawls first and then learns to walk can be seen as a biological development,</a>
00:03:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h04m00s">but that is an unjustified simplification,</a>
00:04:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h04m06s">because people live in a very social world from day one.</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h04m08s">What that means is the way behavioral patterns or micro-personalities</a>
00:04:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h04m15s">begin to organize, always takes place under the influence of the society of which they are a part.</a>
00:04:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h04m22s">Piaget stated that the child has basic built-in reflexes at birth,</a>
00:04:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h04m34s">and that those reflexes are extended to increasingly complex structures,</a>
00:04:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h04m40s">but you can see that even the extension of those basic reflexes ...</a>
00:04:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h04m44s">even in the beginning, there is a search and suck reflex that you can elicit by a child</a>
00:04:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h04m48s">tapping the side of his cheek if it's newborn,</a>
00:04:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h04m52s">and it will try to put whatever ticks in its mouth, that's part of the reflexes,</a>
00:04:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h04m59s">the built-in perceptual and motor unit that enables the child to start sucking.</a>
00:04:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h05m05s">But the bottom line is that what it draws in is not a static and objective entity.</a>
00:05:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h05m11s">It's a person, and part of breastfeeding is establishing a relationship,</a>
00:05:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h05m16s">a complex relationship because it is not just a nutritional relationship.</a>
00:05:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h05m19s">It is a relationship with concern.</a>
00:05:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h05m20s">It is a relationship based on physical interaction.</a>
00:05:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h05m24s">It can be accompanied by nerves, and this often happens, especially with a new mother.</a>
00:05:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h05m30s">It is a very complicated, dynamic, social act,</a>
00:05:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h05m34s">and that means right in the beginning, the baby's knee-jerk movements</a>
00:05:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h05m42s">must be modified by social necessity in order for that process to run smoothly.</a>
00:05:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h05m49s">For example, if a baby is breastfed, it should not bite,</a>
00:05:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h05m55s">he has no teeth yet, so being bitten “in itself” is not a catastrophe, but it is not pleasant.</a>
00:05:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h06m00s">So what happens when the baby bites the mother is the mother pulls back and scares the baby,</a>
00:06:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h06m04s">the baby will cry, and the mother will be shocked by the mistake. The baby must learn ...</a>
00:06:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h06m11s">in a sense he must immediately behave civilized.</a>
00:06:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h06m12s">When Freud talked about the process of socialization, he tended to focus more on toilet training,</a>
00:06:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h06m20s">because he thought that was the first place where ...</a>
00:06:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h06m24s">the first important place where the “id”</a>
00:06:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h06m28s">of the child (what Rogers would see as the organism's domain of experience)</a>
00:06:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h06m34s">is brought under the control of the superego,</a>
00:06:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h06m43s">because for the baby it is of course its fundamental biological function to relieve itself,</a>
00:06:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h06m50s">but that is put under very strict social control,</a>
00:06:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h06m55s">and that is a complicated form of learning.</a>
00:06:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h06m56s">In essence, it is the acquisition of voluntary mastery over what before one</a>
00:06:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h07m02s">involuntary reflex, and that can go well, or bad, or very bad.</a>
00:07:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h07m08s">I knew a family with a daughter who, when she was three,</a>
00:07:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h07m14s">only let her stool flow when she was wearing a diaper.</a>
00:07:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h07m16s">That meant she had complete control over her bowel movements,</a>
00:07:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h07m20s">but that she refused to participate in the social ritual of proper toileting.</a>
00:07:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h07m26s">It was a war, really a war, and such things don't rarely happen,</a>
00:07:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h07m31s">and you remember the movie Crumb, the mother ... the boy accuses the mother of giving them enemas,</a>
00:07:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjpV9mja3Wc#t=00h07m38s">and of course she denies that such a thing would have happened</a>
00:07:38</p>
