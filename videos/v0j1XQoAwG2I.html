<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j1XQoAwG2I#t=00h04m23s">Phenomena are phenomena you observe, and ‘phainesthai’ means to illuminate, i</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j1XQoAwG2I#t=00h04m39s">and I think you can confidently conclude that this is actually the way the brain is connected because your brain is connected</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j1XQoAwG2I#t=00h04m44s">so it reacts to things that have meaning before you create a perception of it as a thing, and the reason for that is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j1XQoAwG2I#t=00h04m55s">even more important than looking at things as objects. Well, for example,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j1XQoAwG2I#t=00h05m10s">it's not that you attribute the meaning of the place you fall from to the cliff as an object -</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j1XQoAwG2I#t=00h05m16s">first comes the understanding of where you fall from, and then the abstract understanding that it is a cliff, if at all</a>
