<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpA5iDpnrbw#t=00h18m28s">on Genesis which some of you might be interested in either watching or listening to. it's actually being very popular</a>
00:18:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpA5iDpnrbw#t=00h18m35s">Which is very peculiar</a>
00:18:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpA5iDpnrbw#t=00h18m37s">I rented a theater of about this size to give the lectures and it sold out</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpA5iDpnrbw#t=00h18m43s">15 lectures on Genesis and almost all the people who came were men</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpA5iDpnrbw#t=00h18m53s">you know and and they were usually men and I would say between about 28 and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpA5iDpnrbw#t=00h19m54s">The way Genesis is structured. It's quite interesting. There's three elements</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpA5iDpnrbw#t=00h20m15s">And that's a hard thing to understand in itself. You could think about it as a theory of the structure of experience</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpA5iDpnrbw#t=00h20m20s">That's another way of thinking about it. You know, you have experience of the world and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpA5iDpnrbw#t=00h20m45s">Given that Genesis is certainly not a scientific account of the structure of the Universe. It has to be some account of some other</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpA5iDpnrbw#t=00h20m53s">Of something else and it's it's an account of experience itself and maybe experience itself is the ultimate reality</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpA5iDpnrbw#t=00h43m56s">I'm gonna split an argument into two parts here. The first thing is I don't think that we can be deterministic</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpA5iDpnrbw#t=00h44m05s">neurobiologically that if you want to run deterministically like on habit</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpA5iDpnrbw#t=00h44m09s">Which would be what?</a>
00:44:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpA5iDpnrbw#t=00h44m10s">Deterministically would be you have to practice and practice and practice and practice and practice and build all the machinery that allows you to act</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpA5iDpnrbw#t=00h44m16s">deterministically and then there'll be a stimulus and the whole</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpA5iDpnrbw#t=00h44m24s">So like if you're a tennis pro, you know, you're acting deterministically all the time because you don't have enough</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpA5iDpnrbw#t=00h44m44s">You spent like ten thousand dollars building them and so fine and when you're driving your car you're walking</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpA5iDpnrbw#t=00h45m16s">You're you're a clock and you're wound up and you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpA5iDpnrbw#t=00h45m29s">It's not there so I don't see how determinism ISM can account for that</a>
