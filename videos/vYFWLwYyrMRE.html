00:15:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h15m15s">so let's let's take a look at the history of or the idea of the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h15m19s">Unconscious to begin with and one of the things that you might want to consider</a>
00:15:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h15m23s">Conceptually is that there are many different forms of unconscious</a>
00:15:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h15m26s">There's not just one and so Alan bursae points out that by 1904 functions of the unconscious had been described</a>
00:15:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h15m33s">There's a conservative function. So the unconscious stores memories often unaccessible to voluntary recall</a>
00:15:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h15m40s">Well, that's a strange one, you know</a>
00:15:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h15m42s">obviously you remember your past but you don't remember all of</a>
00:15:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h15m45s">What you can remember at any given time and you don't really have access to that full store of memories</a>
00:15:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h15m51s">although you can try to remember so the unconscious is the</a>
00:15:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h15m55s">You could imagine the memories are represented somehow</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h15m59s">Neurologically, but neural the neurological structure isn't exactly the mind like the neurological structure isn't exactly your consciousness</a>
00:15:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h16m06s">There's some relationship between them that we don't know and the unconscious</a>
00:16:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h16m10s">from a conceptual perspective is the place that your memories are that you</a>
00:16:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h16m15s">Sometimes can get access to and sometimes can't and so</a>
00:16:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h16m19s">you might think well that there are the memories that you can't get access to there might be a variety of reasons you can't get</a>
00:16:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h16m25s">access to them one might be that you've just forgotten them and</a>
00:16:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h16m28s">One might be that they're so painful that you don't want to bring them to mind</a>
00:16:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h16m32s">You'll you'll engage in tricks to stop yourself from getting access to them</a>
00:16:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h16m36s">And or maybe they're memories that are so complex that and painful that even if you did get access to them</a>
00:16:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h16m43s">You wouldn't exactly know what to do with them</a>
00:16:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h16m45s">and so there's not a lot of reason for you to bring them to mind because all it is is pain without any without any</a>
00:16:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h16m51s">Utility and when you understand that a little bit you understand more about what Freud meant by repression</a>
00:16:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h16m57s">The thing about Freud is that he kind of believed that</a>
00:16:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h17m00s">like many people believe now that when you remember an event in the past</a>
00:17:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h17m05s">It's it's almost as if you're using a video tape recorder and that when you experience that the memory is somehow</a>
00:17:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h17m11s">Recorded in you like it happened</a>
00:17:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h17m14s">But that's not a very accurate version of how memory works I mean</a>
00:17:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h17m19s">We know that memories can be easily distorted</a>
00:17:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h17m22s">for example</a>
00:17:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h17m23s">if you interview someone about an event and</a>
00:17:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h17m25s">You make suggestions that there was something present in the event that wasn't there and then you bring them back a couple of weeks later</a>
00:17:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h17m31s">And you ask them about the same event?</a>
00:17:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h17m33s">they'll often incorporate the thing that they were told into the event and</a>
00:17:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h17m37s">So and the idea that you can make an objective record of something that's happening to you is kind of a strange notion anyways</a>
00:17:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h17m44s">because so for example if you're having an argument with someone and</a>
00:17:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h17m48s">Later you I asked what the argument was about and the other person has asked what the argument is about</a>
00:17:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h17m53s">there's no necessary reason why the accounts will</a>
00:17:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h17m56s">Jibe at all because a lot of time when you're having an argument with someone you're arguing about what the argument is about</a>
00:17:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h18m02s">Right say well, you're angry at me. Well why this is why I think you're angry at me</a>
00:18:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h18m07s">You say no this is why I think this event has occurred and you're thinking about especially if we know each other</a>
00:18:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h18m13s">Well, you're thinking about the contextualization of that event across our entire history</a>
00:18:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h18m19s">and I'm doing the same thing and I'm gonna highlight things that you're not gonna highlight and I'm gonna draw causal inferences that you're not</a>
00:18:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h18m25s">Going to draw and for us just to get on the same page about the memory. It's going to be very difficult</a>
00:18:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h18m30s">So the idea that in specially with complex interactions with people that you can somehow</a>
00:18:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h18m35s">make a video recording of the memory and actually capture what happens is is very very</a>
00:18:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h18m41s">It's it's not true. You you can't I mean you might be able to extract out certain objective facts, but</a>
00:18:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h18m48s">But generally if it's a dialogical issue if it's a relationship issue</a>
00:18:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h18m51s">It spans such a long period of time that just cutting a slice of it out doesn't</a>
00:18:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h18m56s">constitute a reasonable record of what it means and</a>
00:18:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h19m00s">That's what you're more concerned with - like when when you have an experience, you know</a>
00:19:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h19m05s">I'm not so much concerned about what happened from an objective perspective</a>
00:19:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h19m08s">You're more concerned about what the experience means and then you might ask</a>
00:19:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h19m13s">Well, what does it mean to mean something and that was the question? I was trying to answer in that paper</a>
00:19:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h19m19s">I had you read right at the beginning of the class</a>
00:19:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h19m21s">but one of the things that meaning means is that it has</a>
00:19:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h19m25s">Implication for the way you look at the world or the way you act in the world. And so if I tell you something meaningful</a>
00:19:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h19m30s">what that's going to mean is in the future you're going to act slightly differently or maybe</a>
00:19:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h19m35s">Radically differently depending on how meaning it meaningful it is but also that the way that you look at the world has shifted</a>
00:19:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h19m41s">And the way that you look at the world is actually an unconscious. It's actually an unconscious process</a>
00:19:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h19m46s">I mean</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h19m48s">While you're looking at the world how it is or why it is that you're looking at the world in that way</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h19m52s">I mean because well</a>
00:19:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h19m55s">First of all, it would just be too complicated and second you wouldn't be able to concentrate on what was actually going on</a>
00:19:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h20m01s">So your attention?</a>

00:44:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h44m02s">this happens all the times their eyes will move or they'll smile or you can see as</a>
00:44:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h44m06s">They're speaking that all sorts of different ideas are flitting through their head</a>
00:44:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h44m10s">It's dreamlike in a sense - it's sort of as if the person is talking and they're dreaming at the same time</a>
00:44:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h44m16s">There's this image Laden set of memories that's going on at the same time and that can be quite broad</a>
00:44:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h44m21s">far broader than they could encapsulate in the words and</a>
00:44:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h44m24s">so you can catch that and if you're really listening to someone really paying attention to them you can see when they're doubtful or when</a>
00:44:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h44m31s">They pause for a long time. That's another one</a>
00:44:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h44m33s">You know that some things come up that that that's occupying their mind and interfering with the flow of conversation</a>
00:44:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h44m40s">Freud was very good at listening in that manner</a>
00:44:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h44m44s">While that happens with jokes too, you know and</a>
00:44:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h44m48s">Like for example when I was showing you guys the Lion King</a>
00:44:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h44m52s">Stills the other day and I showed you that picture of nella laying on her back with that</a>
00:44:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h44m56s">peculiar expression on her face everybody immediately laughed and</a>
00:44:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h45m00s">the you be Freud would have considered that an entry point into the</a>
00:45:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h45m04s">Unconscious because there is a reason you were laughing about it. It goes along with it</a>
00:45:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h45m08s">well</a>
00:45:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h45m08s">it would have gone along with a sexual complex in that situation and everybody recognizes it instantly and they laugh about it and</a>
00:45:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h45m15s">Comedians are really good at that because if they're good comedians</a>
00:45:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h45m18s">They say what everyone's thinking but no one will say and it's a relief to everyone. You know, he</a>
00:45:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h45m23s">What's his name?</a>
00:45:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h45m28s">Canadian comedian so he's making racial jokes. No. No, it's Canadian. Uh, yeah Russell Russell Peters</a>
00:45:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h45m35s">I mean, he's a great example of that, you know</a>
00:45:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h45m36s">He feels a whole stadium with people of all different ethnicities and every single one of them is dying to be</a>
00:45:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h45m42s">Insulted because of their racial background, you know</a>
00:45:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h45m45s">it's a relief to</a>
00:45:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h45m46s">everyone so he had salts the herbs and then he insults the Jews and then he insults the Christians and he's going</a>
00:45:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h45m51s">Oh, I'm so glad finally someone said that</a>
00:45:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h45m53s">No, so so he's speaking to part of their unconscious and it's the part that's actually uncomfortable with all of that kind of discussion</a>
00:45:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h46m01s">Being repressed and staying below the surface</a>
00:46:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h46m04s">It's way too weighty for people so jokes expressed in playful language what culture will not?</a>
00:46:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h46m10s">formally express so</a>
00:46:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h46m12s">You know to that when the culture starts going after the comedian's that things are not good</a>
00:46:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h46m16s">So you should leave the damn comedians alone</a>
00:46:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h46m18s">Because there are the people that can tell the truth and if you start to get annoyed at them, then that's not good</a>
00:46:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h46m23s">so</a>
00:46:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h46m27s">So a Freud was al extraordinarily interested in dreams</a>
00:46:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h46m33s">Poor Freud who were just not gonna be able to cover him in enough detail. Well, um,</a>
00:46:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h46m40s">How will we do this because I should tell you about the dreams</a>
00:46:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h46m46s">Freud wrote a book called the interpretation of dreams and he he was the first person I would say who</a>
00:46:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h46m52s">subjected dreams to a really comprehensive analysis and he used them to</a>
00:46:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h46m58s">Investigate the place of complexes in his psychotherapeutic practice. So his clients would recount their dreams to him now</a>
00:46:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h47m05s">He believed that dreams always expressed an unconscious wish and that was tied into his theory of repression</a>
00:47:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h47m11s">And so for example if you were very very sexually repressed</a>
00:47:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h47m15s">which was very common at the time then you'd have dreams with sexual content that we're expressing the the</a>
00:47:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h47m24s">Undesirable fantasy essentially and by analyzing the dream you could get down to what you could get down to what was being repressed</a>
00:47:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h47m32s">now Freud believed that the dream</a>
00:47:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h47m35s">more or less tied itself in knots</a>
00:47:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h47m37s">trying to hide its</a>
00:47:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h47m38s">Content in some sense and Jung believed instead that the dream was actually trying to be as clear as it could it just wasn't part</a>
00:47:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h47m45s">Of the let's call it the semantic memory system</a>
00:47:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h47m47s">It was it was more like a feeler out into the unknown</a>
00:47:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h47m50s">it was trying to</a>
00:47:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h47m51s">Represent things as clearly as it could and so its use of symbols and that sort of thing wasn't so much to hide the actual</a>
00:47:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h47m58s">Unpleasant content from the dreamer but to express it in the only language that the dream could use and so Freud</a>
00:47:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h48m05s">Of course also believed that some of that was true</a>
00:48:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h48m08s">All right. Well, we're gonna have to stop there. So</a>
00:48:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h48m12s">since it's 2 o'clock, so we'll see you on</a>
00:48:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFWLwYyrMRE#t=00h48m15s">Tuesday</a>
