<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h00m55s">I guess so.  OK! So look we are going to switch gears today.</a>
00:00:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h00m58s">Um.  The first half of this course, as you've</a>

00:01:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h01m05s">because it's grounded essentially in clinical theories</a>
00:01:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h01m07s">of personality it tends more</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h01m09s">towards the philosophical.  And I told you that the reason for that was that</a>
00:01:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h01m12s">I regard clinical psychology as a branch of engineering</a>
00:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h01m15s">rather than a branch of science.</a>
00:01:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h01m17s">It's Human Engineering obviously; and because of that</a>
00:01:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h01m21s">it's an applied science and so that means it straddles the</a>
00:01:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h01m23s">ground between a science and a practice and</a>
00:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h01m26s">and it,  because it's, it</a>
00:01:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h01m29s">involves human beings,</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h01m31s">it necessarily involves value because</a>
00:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h01m34s">we live inside value structures;</a>
00:01:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h01m36s">and so the logical consequence of that is that</a>
00:01:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h01m39s">investigation into the philosophy of value</a>
00:01:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h01m42s">is necessary in order to understand clinical</a>

00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h01m46s">Because really what you are trying to do as a clinician,</a>
00:01:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h01m48s">you could say that you are trying to do two things; one is to help people</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h01m52s">have less terrible lives.  But you are also trying to help them</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h01m55s">have better lives. and there is obviously a value structure</a>
00:01:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h01m58s">that is inherent in that attempt</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h02m00s">because you are moving from something of less value to something of more value</a>
00:02:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h02m03s">and so.. and it's best to just</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h02m06s">to face that and all the complexities</a>
00:02:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h02m09s">that come along with that, head on. Now!</a>
00:02:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h02m12s">I think that what you do as a clinician,</a>
00:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h02m14s">to overcome what ever tendency you might have to</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h02m17s">impose your value structure on someone is you do an awful lot of listening</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h02m20s">And so my basic practise with people</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h02m22s">is to say to them.  "Well; obviously you are here</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h02m25s">because you would like things to be better. But that's OK.</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h02m28s">We can use your definition of what constitutes better.</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h02m31s">We can use your definition of what constitutes worse.</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h02m35s">Or we can establish that through dialogue, and negotiation.</a>
00:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h02m38s">What are you aiming at? How would you like things to be better</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h02m40s">a year from now say?  If you could have what you wanted,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h02m43s">if your life was put together what would that look like?</a>
00:02:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h02m47s">And you can have a very straight forward</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h02m58s">a given psychological school.  Now having said that.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h03m03s">There was research done many  years ago, showing that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h03m09s">which means that you sort of pick and chose from different therapeutic schools.</a>
00:03:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h03m12s">You tended to not be as effective as you were if you were the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h03m18s">and I think that the reason for that is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h03m21s">that there are so many schools of psychological thought</a>

00:09:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h09m18s">and so much of what psychologists publish and</a>
00:09:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h09m21s">write about is incorrect, and the reason it's incorrect</a>
00:09:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h09m24s">is cause they do not have their measurements properly</a>
00:09:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h09m27s">instantiated. It's a massive</a>
00:09:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h09m29s">problem especially in social psychology. In fact it's</a>
00:09:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h09m31s">probably a fatal problem, in that most of the things that</a>
00:09:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h09m34s">social psychologists measure don't exist.</a>
00:09:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h09m37s">And social psychology has been rife with scandals for the last</a>
00:09:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h09m40s">4 or 5 years, and there's good reason for it</a>
00:09:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h09m43s">but a big part of the problem is is that, the measurement</a>
00:09:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h09m46s">that people are not stringent and careful enough about their measurements</a>
00:09:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h09m49s">so we're going to walk through this very very carefully, so I'm going to</a>
00:09:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h09m52s">set forward a set of propositions and you have to</a>
00:09:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h09m55s">think about it, cause each of them are...they're axiomatic, so you</a>
00:09:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h09m58s">sort of have to accept them before you go on to the next step.</a>
00:09:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h10m01s">And there's certainly room to question them.</a>
00:10:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h10m04s">But here's the bare bones of the psychometric model of personality</a>
00:10:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h10m07s">so we'll call it roughly the big 5 model</a>
00:10:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h10m10s">and the reason it's called the big 5 model is because</a>
00:10:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h10m13s">the psychometric investigations have indicated that</a>
00:10:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h10m15s">you can specify human personality along 5</a>
00:10:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h10m18s">basic dimensions. You might ask well what</a>
00:10:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h10m21s">exactly is personality, and well</a>
00:10:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h10m23s">that's partly  what we have been trying to wrestle with in the entire course so far</a>
00:10:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h10m26s">and I would say</a>
00:10:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h10m29s">umm what exactly is a trait. Think of an trait as an element of</a>
00:10:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h10m32s">personality; and I think the best way to think about a trait is</a>
00:10:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h10m35s">as a sub-personality.</a>
00:10:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h10m38s">So you are made up of sub-personalities</a>
00:10:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h10m40s">that are integrated into something</a>
00:10:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h10m43s">vaguely resembling a unity.
But the unity is diverse.</a>
00:10:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h10m46s">There are describable stable elements that characterize you.</a>
00:10:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h10m52s">That are elements of your being.</a>
00:10:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h10m54s">So for example, here are some common ones.</a>
00:10:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h10m57s">I would say, are you so sure ,or would you rather be alone?</a>
00:10:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h11m00s">So here is a good question for you to define</a>
00:11:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h11m03s">decide whether you are an extrovert or an introvert.</a>
00:11:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h11m05s">It's pretty straightforward. It is the first major dimension.</a>
00:11:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h11m08s">Basically if you take any set of questions,</a>
00:11:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h11m11s">about, any set of questions that</a>
00:11:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h11m14s">could be applied descriptively to a human being,</a>
00:11:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h11m17s">and you subject them to a statistical process</a>
00:11:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h11m20s">called factor analysis.</a>
00:11:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h11m22s">You can determine how they group together. So, what I would be interested in,</a>
00:11:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCceO_D4AlY#t=00h11m25s">Let's say I ask you a hundred questions.</a>
