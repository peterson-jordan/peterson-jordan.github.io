00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h00m05s">You're you're in a map</a>
00:00:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h00m06s">So to speak you're using a map and with any luck its detailed enough</a>
00:00:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h00m11s">so that you can use it to get to the place that you want to go and</a>
00:00:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h00m14s">sometimes you don't and that means that you have to</a>
00:00:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h00m18s">Recalibrate your your journey along the map which by the way is exactly what GPS systems do when you go off the pathway</a>
00:00:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h00m25s">Right, they stop</a>
00:00:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h00m27s">That's an anxiety response from the GPS system</a>
00:00:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h00m30s">They stop they recalibrate and they readjust the map now and then if you're unfortunate this very rarely happens anymore</a>
00:00:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h00m37s">You'll be on a road that isn't mapped. And then the GPS system doesn't know what to do</a>
00:00:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h00m42s">Well that happens in real life too. I mean, those are I'm using GPS for a very specific reason</a>
00:00:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h00m46s">Those are intelligent systems as far as I'm concerned</a>
00:00:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h00m48s">those are the closest things we've ever designed to intelligent systems because they can actually orient right they orient in real time and they're unbelievably</a>
00:00:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h00m57s">Sophisticated systems right because they rely on a huge satellite network and and so on and they're cybernetic systems. Technically speaking</a>
00:00:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h01m03s">They respond very much like the way that we respond so</a>
00:01:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h01m09s">so anyways, you know, you're in you inhabit a map you try to adjust the</a>
00:01:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h01m14s">Resolution of the map so that it's munot more complex than it needs to be to get you from point A to point B</a>
00:01:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h01m19s">That's it. You want minimal resolution? Because that enables efficient cognitive processing</a>
00:01:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h01m25s">It doesn't overload you too much like when I'm looking at this room if I look say I want to walk down this pathway</a>
00:01:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h01m31s">basically what my mind does my perceptual field and you can detect this if I look straight ahead I</a>
00:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h01m36s">Can barely see you people on the periphery. You're more like you're kind of like blurs</a>
00:01:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h01m41s">You too, I can tell that you have heads but that's about it when you move I can see your hand</a>
00:01:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h01m46s">I can probably see your eyes, but barely so you're all very low resolution</a>
00:01:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h01m50s">And even though I can't detect it at the very periphery of my vision</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h01m53s">You guys are black and white so my color vision disappears at the periphery, even though I can't I can't actually perceive that</a>
00:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h01m59s">So what happens is if I want to walk down here this pathway becomes high-resolution. It becomes marked with positive emotion</a>
00:01:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h02m07s">All of this turns into low resolution back here</a>
00:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h02m10s">It's not even represented and then I find out well, am I doing this properly and the answer is well</a>
00:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h02m15s">I walk forward and if I get to the goal, then I've done it properly</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h02m19s">Enough and if you know one of you stand up and get in my way</a>
00:02:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h02m22s">Then I'm gonna focus on you and assume instantly that I haven't mapped you properly right?</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h02m27s">I put you in the category of irrelevant entity when in fact you happen to be in the category of strange</a>
00:02:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h02m35s">Object the thing that objects and so well, so then we inhabit those structures all the time</a>
00:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h02m41s">We're in a structure like that a perceptual structure</a>
00:02:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h02m44s">and if it's working then it's got the archetypal quality of</a>
00:02:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h02m48s">Paradise so to speak because it's axioms are correct</a>
00:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h02m52s">And it's functional and then now and then something comes along and that's what the snake is the eternal snake in the garden</a>
00:02:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h02m58s">That pops up inside a structure and it turns out that the things that you weren't attending to are</a>
00:02:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h03m04s">The most important things rather than the least important things and that what does that do? It blows the map into pieces and</a>
00:03:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h03m12s">That can happen at different levels of severity</a>
00:03:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h03m15s">But at the ultimate level of severity its apocalyptic</a>
00:03:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h03m19s">Right everything goes and that's a that's a traumatic intrusion</a>
00:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h03m24s">And essentially the story of the Garden of Eden is the story of a traumatic intrusion. That's exactly what it is</a>
00:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h03m30s">And so what happens is that Adam and Eve are living in unconscious bles. Roughly speaking</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h03m35s">Everything's fine. They're in their walled garden. They're in a paradisal state. They're not aware of their own vulnerability or nakedness</a>
00:03:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h03m42s">so they they're not suffering from negative emotion something pops up that</a>
00:03:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h03m47s">Radically expands their vision and all of a sudden now, they can apprehend all sorts of things that exist as threats</a>
00:03:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h03m54s">So that's their own nakedness and vulnerability and temporality itself because they become aware of the future and bang that</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h04m01s">State of being in that paradise is forever gone. That's the strange thing about human beings</a>
00:04:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h04m07s">Is this is what what happened to us? I think is that our</a>
00:04:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h04m11s">perceptions developed to such a degree that</a>
00:04:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h04m14s">We could no longer ignore what was irrelevant</a>
00:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h04m18s">We couldn't do it because we discovered roughly speaking once we discovered our finite limitations in time and space</a>
00:04:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h04m26s">We discovered that we surrounded by infinite threat</a>
00:04:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h04m29s">always and maybe that's why people are so hyper awake because</a>
00:04:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h04m34s">Threat wakes you up. Well, we're in a constant state of</a>
00:04:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h04m37s">existential threat now the advantage to that is that we take</a>
00:04:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h04m42s">We take arms up against a sea of troubles</a>
00:04:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h04m45s">constantly, that's the advantage right and we build enclosures and we take precautions for the future and we live a very long time and we</a>
00:04:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h04m52s">Generally live quite safe lives compared to the lives we could live and so we've traded pain for anxiety</a>
00:04:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h04m59s">That's another way of thinking about it now</a>
00:04:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h05m01s">It's still a pretty rough trade right because who wants to be nervous all the time</a>
00:05:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h05m06s">But you're alive and awake when you're nervous and it is a form of consciousness</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h05m15s">So the story of Adam and Eve is the story of the eternal fall that that's what it is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h05m20s">It says look you exist in these walled enclosures, but there's something that lurks that will always knock you off your feet</a>
00:05:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87OIyCFKQBk#t=00h05m27s">And then the question is what is that? And and the answer to that is being formulated over very long periods of time partly</a>
