00:00:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLrV1G1ENlA#t=00h00m05s">Thanks for the invitation.</a>
00:00:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLrV1G1ENlA#t=00h00m07s">What I found most interesting in your book is the stuff you write about child development and child upbringing and</a>
00:00:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLrV1G1ENlA#t=00h00m13s">for example you explain how overprotective parents can damage their children?</a>
00:00:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLrV1G1ENlA#t=00h00m20s">You say it's far better to render beings in your care competent than to protect them.</a>
00:00:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLrV1G1ENlA#t=00h00m24s">Do you think that the parents 
today are</a>
00:00:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLrV1G1ENlA#t=00h00m28s">more protective of their children than previous generations.</a>
00:00:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLrV1G1ENlA#t=00h00m32s">I would say that it looks like that.</a>
00:00:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLrV1G1ENlA#t=00h00m34s">Yes, I think there are complex reasons for that. I don't think that you can necessarily</a>
00:00:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLrV1G1ENlA#t=00h00m39s">lay that at the feet of the parents people are having fewer children and</a>
00:00:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLrV1G1ENlA#t=00h00m45s">and they're having them later in life and</a>
00:00:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLrV1G1ENlA#t=00h00m47s">So I think both of those things those are major demographic shifts</a>
00:00:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLrV1G1ENlA#t=00h00m51s">and I think that one of the</a>
00:00:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLrV1G1ENlA#t=00h00m52s">Consequences of that is that children's lives are much more organized than they used to be</a>
00:00:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLrV1G1ENlA#t=00h00m56s">which might have some advantages</a>
00:00:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLrV1G1ENlA#t=00h00m58s">but that also parents are more likely to over protect their older and more cautious and</a>
00:00:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLrV1G1ENlA#t=00h01m03s">the children also don't have as many siblings and of course siblings were part of the child raising process and and</a>
00:01:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLrV1G1ENlA#t=00h01m10s">It's hard to be over protected in some ways when you're competing with a bunch of siblings</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLrV1G1ENlA#t=00h01m15s">So it's complicated but I think that over protection is a problem</a>
00:01:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLrV1G1ENlA#t=00h01m20s">Rule 11 is do not bother children when they are skateboarding. This is a recurring theme in your book</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLrV1G1ENlA#t=00h01m27s">If we are overprotective with our children</a>
00:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLrV1G1ENlA#t=00h01m30s">We will create weak individuals.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLrV1G1ENlA#t=00h01m32s">Well you you demolish people's resilience that way.</a>
00:01:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLrV1G1ENlA#t=00h01m35s">I mean life is difficult and you cannot protect your children?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLrV1G1ENlA#t=00h01m58s">often more than that because of course people go through very difficult times in their lives and a</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLrV1G1ENlA#t=00h02m51s">That allow their eight or nine-year-old sons to sleep in their beds at night instead of sleeping in their own rooms</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLrV1G1ENlA#t=00h04m13s">still you believe strict parenting is important and you think this</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLrV1G1ENlA#t=00h04m21s">Why is the use of force justifiable</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLrV1G1ENlA#t=00h04m24s">Well it depends on the context and it also depends on what you mean by force</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLrV1G1ENlA#t=00h04m28s">There isn't a disciplinary strategy that you can utilize that doesn't involve something that's unpleasant while you can use reward</a>
