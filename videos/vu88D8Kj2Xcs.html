					<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h00m00s">Well I previously played with some kids who had never played any kind of rough physical play before.</a>
00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h00m06s">Playing with these children is very difficult</a>
00:00:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h00m07s">Because they get scared easily, you know? They want to play? - I know how to play with the kids.</a>
00:00:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h00m13s">They want to play, and they are very excited about it</a>
00:00:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h00m15s">They are eager to play the physical ones, but are confused, do you understand what I mean? When you play with them</a>
00:00:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h00m21s">You find them, for example, tapping you with their finger in your eye</a>
00:00:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h00m23s">Or they quickly cry out of nothing, and in short it seems as if they don't know what to do.</a>
00:00:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h00m30s">But a child who has had a lot of play and physical interaction,</a>
00:00:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h00m35s">His matter is different, because the first thing this child knows is</a>
00:00:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h00m38s">- Although it is not an authorized rule -</a>
00:00:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h00m42s">he is</a>
00:00:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h00m44s">The amount of strength he can wield with you so that the game is interesting and enjoyable, but not too much</a>
00:00:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h00m50s">And that's a really important question, actually because it is</a>
00:00:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h00m54s">To really play a good game of physical contact like wrestling with a kid, you want to make that kid</a>
00:00:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h01m01s">It attacks you to the maximum degree that it cannot harm you. The more this child is on the threshold of the degree that hurts you, the more enjoyable the game is for both parties</a>
00:01:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h01m06s">Because the child will hang around Kafa, for example</a>
00:01:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h01m08s">Then laugh, do I mean?</a>
00:01:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h01m09s">This is a good thing. And then maybe he will hold you stronger</a>
00:01:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h01m13s">To see if he could escape by doing it. Children often approach you</a>
00:01:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h01m16s">Then they give you a palm and then run</a>
00:01:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h01m18s">And then they look to see your reaction, and if you laugh, next time they will come and hang you up stronger, see what I mean? They increase strength gradually</a>
00:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h01m23s">Because it is fundamentally exploratory behavior. And part of their exploration is a question:</a>
00:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h01m26s">" So,</a>
00:01:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h01m29s">What is the body? "</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h01m31s">And the answer to that is: Well, what can you do with this body and get away with it by doing it?</a>
00:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h01m35s">But it is also a more complicated answer, because the question is, "What can you do with this body and get away with it for your action?"</a>
00:01:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h01m40s">While you can also continue to explore,</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h01m45s">Without fear or,</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h01m46s">Punishment, and without spoiling the game you're playing ''</a>
00:01:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h01m49s">So how do you find out? These things cannot be explained by mouth! You must practice it to know</a>
00:01:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h01m55s">It is like this:</a>
00:01:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h01m56s">"The child hits you, wrestles, pulls you by your hair, and does all these actions ... while you are modifying his behavior very carefully.</a>
00:01:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h02m02s">And you pay attention to the smallest details, and then you get a witty kid who wrestles madly</a>
00:02:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h02m07s">And these kids are fun to play with, they just jump around like a dog that won't bite you, you know what I'm talking about? Well trained dog</a>
00:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h02m13s">You can actually play with him and you can rough too</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h02m15s">And it'd be cool! The dog is amused and the person is amused. The situation here is excellent. This is a social dog (i.e. it was trained for that)</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h02m24s">So. The other nice thing kids learn is</a>
00:02:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h02m26s">What really hurts them and what does not harm them. And how apprehensive they can be</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h02m32s">But also enjoying it</a>
00:02:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h02m33s">As you know, when you struggle with a child, for example, you turn him on his face, or lean on him with your elbow</a>
00:02:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h02m39s">Or you bend his body together .. You throw him in the air and then grab him, do you understand what I mean?</a>
00:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h02m42s">And what you show the child here is</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h02m48s">“These are some of the things your body can do, and it is okay for it to happen</a>
00:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h02m52s">This will not harm you. ”These are things that you do not talk about but explain through action. Thus the child becomes somewhat confident about</a>
00:02:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h03m00s">What he or she can bear physically</a>
00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h03m03s">The difference between pain and non-pain, and the difference between</a>
00:03:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h03m09s">Fearlessness and lack of fear, when something is dangerous and when it is not. It's very complicated.</a>
00:03:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h03m14s">It's a very complex behavior, and that's part of the reason kids love to play. And now ... one of the things that happened</a>
00:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h03m21s">Which is an indicator of a deep disease in our society, is that</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h03m25s">I used to work in kindergarten when I was your age because I really love children</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h03m30s">And they love to play with me because I know how to play with them.</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h03m33s">So one of the things I've been doing with little kids is this</a>
00:03:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h03m36s">I've been painting them terrifying monsters, okay? Like things with giant teeth and so on. I was just drawing them a little bit. They were not pieces of art, for example, do you understand what I mean?</a>
00:03:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h03m42s">But these kids are [ __ ]</a>
00:03:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h03m44s">They were lining up around me to get a picture of a monster</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h03m46s">They say "Draw a monster shape for me", "Draw a monster shape for me!"</a>
00:03:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h03m49s">They adore these simple drawings of monsters. So this was kind of comedic.</a>
00:03:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h03m53s">And another thing I was doing was playing with them</a>
00:03:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h03m55s">For example, I used to take them to the monsters, grab an arm and a foot, and wrap them around</a>
00:03:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h03m59s">Or I would compliment them on some of them, or for example have them climb on me</a>
00:03:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h04m04s">But there was always someone in the group who couldn't do it</a>
00:04:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h04m07s">He looks like he's not being given enough attention, see what I mean? It was like a carving stone that was not carved on it:</a>
00:04:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h04m13s">It is very dull and poor in composition</a>
00:04:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h04m16s">And heavy. So a kid like that, for example, you sit down and -</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h04m20s">It's so sad - you sit down and interact with the kids. And this child is kissing you with them while he walks like he's limping - he walks like this</a>
00:04:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h04m27s">It stumbles and falls into your lap</a>
00:04:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h04m29s">And they're like ... they're just as sophisticated as 6-month-olds, you see what I mean? And they are children of Khnagha, Rado Fahmini</a>
00:04:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h04m34s">What an ugly need they will die for attention. The subject is usually very late</a>
00:04:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h04m40s">They are 4 years old. It's like, "Good luck fixing that, buddy. That won't happen."</a>
00:04:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h04m43s">Understand me? These babies are simply trembling because what happens to them is that they are so distressed and ill-formed</a>
00:04:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h04m50s">They are uncomfortable in their bodies, do not have the slightest degree of social awareness, are not alert, receptive, and neglected, and are inflamed with hatred because there is no one of the other children wanting to play with them.</a>
00:04:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h04m58s">What is normal. Because the other children are way ahead of them in their way of playing</a>
00:04:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h05m02s">They get stopped from playing with them</a>
00:05:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h05m05s">It's like playing with a family who has 9 months, and whoever is some children can do like that, understand me?</a>
00:05:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h05m09s">But this is not a play I mean. And these children simply stoop away.</a>
00:05:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h05m14s">They remain outside the crowd in their age group and never enter it</a>
00:05:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h05m18s">Never let him in. It is very, very ugly. Now in nurseries, you are prohibited from touching children</a>
00:05:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u88D8Kj2Xcs#t=00h05m27s">what the hell?! Why? Well, because you can't distinguish play from harassment. Oh really? Who cannot distinguish that ?!</a>
