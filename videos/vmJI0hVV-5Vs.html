a part I have difficulty with, because the</a>
00:00:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h00m11s">conceptual transformation is very, very large.</a>
00:00:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h00m15s">Because so far we’ve been talking about,
I would say, biological and evolutionary realities,</a>
00:00:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h00m22s">in a sense.</a>
00:00:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h00m25s">And we’ve been doing that in a relatively
standard manner.</a>
00:00:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h00m27s">I mean, there are elements of Piagetian theory
that run through it, there are elements of</a>
00:00:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h00m33s">cybernetic theory, there are elements of neurobiology
and neuropsychology.</a>
00:00:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h00m39s">And none of it, I would say in some sense,
is radically outside the way these sorts of</a>
00:00:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h00m49s">problems might be discussed in a typical scientific
or social scientific manner.</a>
00:00:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h01m05s">Except for maybe the fact that we’ve drawn
an explicit distinction between the world</a>
00:01:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h01m12s">as a place of things and the world as a place
of action.</a>
00:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h01m19s">Now there are consequences to the idea that
the world is a place of action that start</a>
00:01:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h01m23s">to become more radical at this point.</a>
00:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h01m27s">But drawing the relationship between what
I’ve already talked to you about and the</a>
00:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h01m32s">narrative domains that we’re going to explore
now, requires a… like a radical shift in</a>
00:01:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h01m42s">conceptual focus.</a>
00:01:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h01m44s">And so, the way I’m going to handle that
is by hitting it from ten or eleven different</a>
00:01:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h01m49s">directions, and building up a pattern.</a>
00:01:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h01m56s">You know, if you listen to a complex piece
of music, or at least this is my experience</a>
00:01:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h01m59s">with complex music, is sometimes, the first
time I hear it, I don’t really like it,</a>
00:01:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h02m03s">and I think I also don’t understand it.</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h02m06s">I actually can’t hear it.</a>
00:02:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h02m08s">You know, maybe a musical genius could hear
the whole thing instantly.</a>
00:02:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h02m11s">You know, they say Franz Liszt could sight-read
anything on the piano first try.</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h02m18s">So, you know, some people are so intelligent
musically that it’s incomprehensible, and</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h02m23s">I’m sure they hear things just fine the
first time they hear them.</a>
00:02:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h02m26s">But then what happens for me is that if I
listen to it a couple more times or pieces</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h02m30s">or chunks of it, they start to fall into place
that I can follow, and, you know, I can see</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h02m34s">the beauty sort of shine through those.</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h02m36s">And then eventually, the whole thing links
together, and then I can listen to it, especially</a>
00:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h02m42s">if it’s a complex piece of music, many,
many, many times.</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h02m46s">And the more complex, and probably the better,
the piece of music, the more I can listen</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h02m50s">to it.</a>
00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h02m51s">But if I listen to it enough, at some point
then I’ve had enough of it, and it’s all</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h02m56s">a very strange phenomenon.</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h02m58s">Because one of the things you might ask yourself
is, what exactly are you learning while you’re</a>
00:02:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h03m01s">doing that?</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h03m02s">You know, it seems like you want the music
to be just exactly the right amount of predictable</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h03m10s">and unpredictable.</a>
00:03:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h03m11s">If it’s too unpredictable then you can’t
understand it and if it’s too predictable</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h03m14s">it’s boring, and so it’s just like a conversation
that way.</a>
00:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h03m16s">It’s actually just like life as well!</a>
00:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h03m19s">You know, because you want things to be predictable
and stable, and you want things to be unpredictable</a>
00:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h03m24s">and interesting, and the degree to which you
want each of those is going to depend on the</a>
00:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h03m29s">time and the context and also on your own
intelligence and temperament.</a>
00:03:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h03m35s">Now, I’m going to tell you a bunch of stories
and give you a number of pieces of information,</a>
00:03:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h03m44s">and hopefully they’ll click together.</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h03m47s">Now I think the reason this information has
always been transmitted in story and image</a>
00:03:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h03m52s">form is because it’s very, very difficult
to transform it into articulated, like into</a>
00:03:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h03m57s">fully articulated explanation.</a>
00:03:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h03m58s">It isn’t really how it works.</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h04m00s">You know, we’re not really accustomed to
thinking about the idea that there are certain</a>
00:04:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h04m04s">forms of information (that are valid forms
of information) that can’t be transmitted</a>
00:04:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h04m10s">verbally.</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h04m11s">But of course, if you think about it, we all
understand this deeply.</a>
00:04:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h04m14s">Well, I can give you a bunch of examples.</a>
00:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h04m17s">The first example is that when you speak,
not only do you speak in words and phrases</a>
00:04:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h04m23s">and sentences and paragraphs, but you also
speak melodically.</a>
00:04:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h04m27s">And in fact, part of the reason that you can
understand melodies and that they make sense</a>
00:04:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h04m31s">to you is that what artists have done is separated
the melodic elements of speech from the semantic</a>
00:04:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h04m39s">element, and then played with the melodic
element.</a>
00:04:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h04m41s">And the melodic element tends to carry a lot
of emotion and intent.</a>
00:04:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h04m46s">And so, if you’re listening to someone speak,
you can tell when they’re being ironic,</a>
00:04:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h04m51s">you know, because they raise an eyebrow, and
their voice changes slightly, even though</a>
00:04:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h04m55s">they might be using, in fact they are using,
exactly the same words.</a>
00:04:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h04m58s">And in fact someone who’s very good at being
witty or ironic will set the situation up</a>
00:04:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h05m03s">so that you can barely tell that they’re
joking, and the better they are at that, the</a>
00:05:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h05m08s">tinier the hint they give you that you can
still catch on to, the funnier the situation</a>
00:05:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h05m13s">is.</a>
00:05:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h05m15s">So we know that information can be transmitted
through non-verbal channels.</a>
00:05:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h05m19s">It even happens during speech.</a>
00:05:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h05m22s">And then, of course, we understand that music
presents to us an intimation of meaning that’s</a>
00:05:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h05m30s">very difficult to fully grasp.</a>
00:05:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h05m33s">And music for me has always been an ineffable
phenomenon in some sense because it carries</a>
00:05:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h05m40s">the intimation of meaning in a manner that
can’t be rationally dismissed, or that people</a>
00:05:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h05m45s">aren’t interested in rationally dismissing.</a>
00:05:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h05m48s">Even punk rock nihilists listen to punk rock
nihilistic music, and they find that meaningful</a>
00:05:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h05m55s">even though they don’t believe in meaning!</a>
00:05:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h05m57s">And you know, in some sense they’re victims
of their own rationality, because they do</a>
00:05:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h06m02s">believe in meaning (or else they wouldn’t
be listening to the music), but they can’t</a>
00:06:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h06m04s">understand how they could possibly believe
in it, so their rational mind has dispensed</a>
00:06:04</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h06m10s">And sometimes people dispense with the idea
of meaning, for lots of reasons.</a>
00:06:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h06m15s">Partly because it’s inevitable, in some
sense, with sufficient rationality, but also</a>
00:06:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h06m20s">because it’s always useful to look for the
underbelly of things, because it also justifies</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h06m29s">And that’s fairly… that can be a very
desirable side-effect of the particular ideological</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h06m37s">And then there’s dance, of course, and dance
is even more ineffable than music, although</a>
00:06:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h06m42s">it’s often paired with music, you know,
and it grips people.</a>
00:06:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h06m47s">If you see a remarkable dance performance,
well part of it is that you’re sort of thrilled</a>
00:06:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h06m53s">and excited about seeing just exactly what
the human form can do.</a>
00:06:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h06m56s">Perhaps, partly, because you’re human and
when you see someone extending a certain ability</a>
00:06:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h07m03s">far beyond the norm then it expands your sense
of what a human being is capable of, so there’s</a>
00:07:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h07m09s">that, there’s the pure skill element.</a>
00:07:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h07m11s">And then there’s the novelty element, because
often if you watch a particularly good dancer</a>
00:07:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h07m17s">there’s things they do that you haven’t
seen before that you didn’t know anyone</a>
00:07:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h07m20s">could do and that’s pretty fun.</a>
00:07:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h07m22s">And then often the dance is joined with the
music and the body is expressing what the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h07m27s">music means and even though you can’t tell
what the music means you can tell that the</a>
00:07:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h07m31s">dance is expressing it.</a>
00:07:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h07m33s">See I think what happens there is that music
represents the patterns of being.</a>
00:07:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h07m39s">It’s actually because people think of music
as a non-representational art, but I think</a>
00:07:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h07m43s">that’s wrong, I think it might be the most
representational art.</a>
00:07:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h07m47s">Being is made up of layers of patterns constantly
interacting, and hopefully in a relatively</a>
00:07:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h07m54s">harmonious way, and music demonstrates that,
mimics it in some sense, abstractly.</a>
00:07:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h08m01s">And then the dance is an abstract representation.</a>
00:08:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h08m04s">People adapt to the patterns of being and
the dancer adapts to the pattern of music,</a>
00:08:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h08m09s">and so it’s symbolic, it’s an embodied
display of the place of the person in the</a>
00:08:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h08m16s">cosmos.</a>
00:08:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h08m17s">And you could also make that case when you
see people dancing in pairs, because you could</a>
00:08:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h08m21s">dance alone or you could dance in pairs, and
that’s basically standard human adaptation.</a>
00:08:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h08m28s">And music is interesting too because one of
the things you’ll notice is that there’s</a>
00:08:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h08m32s">always music in a movie.</a>
00:08:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h08m35s">Almost always.</a>
00:08:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h08m36s">There’s the odd movie that doesn’t have
it but it’s quite marked when it’s absent,</a>
00:08:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h08m39s">you know.</a>
00:08:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h08m40s">The movie feels a lot more cold and clinical,
although it can work.</a>
00:08:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h08m44s">But we accept the idea that music can be used
to fill in the missing context in a movie</a>
00:08:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h08m49s">without even ever questioning it, right?</a>
00:08:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h08m51s">Like, it’s very strange if you think about
it, that you go to a movie that is doing…</a>
00:08:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h08m57s">at least part of its function is to portray
reality in a realistic way, but there’s</a>
00:08:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h09m02s">a soundtrack playing in the background all
the time.</a>
00:09:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h09m04s">You know it’s so useful and so appropriate
that you don’t notice how strange it is</a>
00:09:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h09m11s">that that’s okay.</a>
00:09:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h09m13s">So, my point is that we well, and then of
course you can talk about novels and plays</a>
00:09:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h09m20s">the same way, because there’s a lot more
to a novel than the words themselves.</a>
00:09:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h09m26s">There’s you know, a novel is a deeply layered
thing, and part of your understanding of the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h09m34s">novel is your understanding of the interrelationships
between the layers, especially if it’s a</a>
00:09:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h09m38s">profound novel.</a>
00:09:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h09m39s">I mean I think that’s why we have this sense
of depth in artistic and literary works.</a>
00:09:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h09m45s">If the work is deep then it has many, many
layers, and the more layers it has interacting</a>
00:09:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h09m51s">at the same time, the more it’s a useful
representation of the essential elements of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h09m56s">being, and so the more meaningful it is to
us.</a>
00:09:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h09m59s">So, that’s all to say that there are modes
of communication that provide us with information</a>
00:09:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h10m06s">that we can’t articulate but that we still
act as if that information is valid.</a>
00:10:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h10m13s">And you might say, well, valid for what, what
exactly is it doing, what is it representing,</a>
00:10:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h10m18s">what kind of information is it offering that’s
so compelling?</a>
00:10:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h10m23s">And what’s so interesting about it is the
kind of information that we’re talking,</a>
00:10:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h10m26s">that information is so compelling, that you’ll
pay to expose yourself to it.</a>
00:10:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h10m32s">You know, it’s a rare lecture that you go
to and have to pay for the lecture itself.</a>
00:10:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h10m36s">I mean, you’ll come to the university and
you’ll get your degree, but if you had your</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h10m40s">option on a Saturday afternoon, or a Saturday
night, let’s say, it’s relatively unlikely</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h10m46s">that you would attend a lecture, and certainly
even more than unlikely that you would pay</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h10m54s">And, you know, why that is, is not obvious.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h10m57s">You say, well it’s entertaining.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h11m03s">that dismissing things that are enjoyable

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h11m28s">to non-verbal cultural forms and he talked
about them as epiphenomenal, fundamentally.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h11m44s">and drama and music, and science came way,

about someone who’s artistically gifted.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h13m34s">So anyways, the point is that there’s lots
of different ways that we can communicate</a>
00:13:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h13m38s">information.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h13m39s">And you might say well it’s only simple
information that can be conveyed that way,</a>
00:13:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h13m42s">and you have to convey the complex information
in more formal forms, scientific and philosophical,</a>
00:13:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h13m48s">but I think that’s exactly backwards.</a>
00:13:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h13m50s">I think we get to articulate the simple stuff
first, which is only what you expect, right?</a>
00:13:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h13m56s">Because when you’re mastering something
difficult, like the unfolding of being, the</a>

the simple things first and the complicated</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h14m05s">things later is pretty much 100%.</a>
00:14:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h14m07s">And I mean, different fields advance at different
speeds, but the artists and musicians get</a>
00:14:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h14m15s">to the complex matters far before the scientists
and the engineers.</a>
00:14:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h14m21s">And it has to be that way.</a>
00:14:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h14m22s">One of the deep things I learned from Jung
was that, as our knowledge expands out into</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h14m30s">the unknown, there are people operating at
the periphery, and so they really have one</a>
00:14:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h14m35s">foot in the unknown and one foot on dry land,
so to speak.</a>
00:14:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h14m38s">And some of them are more in the water than
the others.</a>
00:14:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h14m41s">And the ones almost submerged up to their
neck, when they tell you what they’re seeing,</a>
00:14:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h14m45s">it has to be poetic and musical and artistic,
because it’s so far beyond our capacity</a>
00:14:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h14m51s">to articulate, that we can’t represent it
in words.</a>
00:14:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h14m54s">And so all that can happen is that the artist
can get hold of it, and maybe the people who</a>
00:14:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h15m00s">are prone to religious-like sentiments, at
least experiences, which seems to be associated</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h15m07s">To have the actual religious experience, rather
than to be an adherent of the dogma, which</a>
00:15:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h15m12s">is associated with low openness.</a>
00:15:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h15m14s">So for Jung, it was the artists and the entrepreneurs,
because they’re the same people, who were</a>
00:15:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h15m21s">at the forefront of the expansion of what
we know into what is unknown.</a>
00:15:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h15m25s">And I think you can see echoes of that in
the way in which cities are rejuvenated.</a>
00:15:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h15m30s">Because what happens, you can certainly see
this in Toronto, is that a part of the city</a>
00:15:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h15m34s">that has some architectural or contextual
interest but is badly run down, starts to</a>
00:15:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h15m40s">get… at some point, you know, the artistic
people show up and they think “Hey!</a>
00:15:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h15m45s">This is kind of cool.</a>
00:15:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h15m46s">If we just did this to it there’d really
be something to it”.</a>
00:15:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h15m49s">And it usually doesn’t hurt that the rents
are low because of course artists never have</a>
00:15:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h15m54s">any money.</a>
00:15:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h15m55s">So then they go in there and civilise the
hell out of it.</a>
00:15:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h15m58s">And of course, they’re renting, and that
jacks up the property value, and then the</a>
00:15:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h16m01s">people who are a little less open but kind
of interested in art start flowing in behind</a>
00:16:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h16m05s">them.</a>
00:16:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h16m06s">And then soon the whole place is rejuvenated
and expensive, and of course the artists have</a>
00:16:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h16m11s">to go somewhere else.</a>
00:16:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h16m13s">But that’s a very interesting phenomenon,
because what’s happening is that even in</a>
00:16:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h16m17s">the cities they’re taking chaos and turning
it into order, and that’s what artists do.</a>
00:16:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h16m24s">Now that’s all to tell you that there are
different ways of transmitting and representing</a>
00:16:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h16m31s">information, and that you can incorporate
the information without any articulated notion</a>
00:16:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h16m38s">of what you’re doing.</a>
00:16:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h16m40s">So of course that’s the case, because otherwise
you’d have to claim that you understand</a>
00:16:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h16m44s">everything that you do and can articulate
it, and that’s just wrong, you know.</a>
00:16:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h16m51s">You have a theory of yourself but it’s not
a very accurate theory, which is why you’re</a>
00:16:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h16m55s">always doing things that are strange as far
as you’re concerned, which is also extremely</a>
00:16:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h16m59s">bizarre.</a>
00:16:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h17m00s">It’s like, who the hell are you if you can’t
even control your own behaviour?</a>
00:17:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h17m05s">And what does it mean to control it, and what
does it mean to not control it?</a>
00:17:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h17m08s">These are very, very complex and strange issues.</a>
00:17:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h17m12s">Alright, so I think the best way into this
is actually from an evolutionary perspective.</a>
00:17:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h17m20s">And I’m not convinced that this is correct
but I think there’s something to it.</a>
00:17:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h17m27s">So when you think about the nature of experience,
then you think, well the nature of experience</a>
00:17:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h17m38s">is quite different for different sorts of
creatures.</a>
00:17:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h17m42s">And one of the primary differences between
creatures is the degree to which they’re</a>
00:17:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h17m45s">capable of social interaction and then of
complex social interaction.</a>
00:17:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h17m50s">And primates generally speaking are very social
creatures.</a>
00:17:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h17m54s">They live in troops, or packs, like dogs.</a>
00:17:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h18m00s">Which is why we can get along with dogs, because
we understand each other.</a>
00:18:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h18m03s">Being hierarchical troop animals, we understand
dogs, and they understand us, and they can</a>
00:18:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h18m07s">fit right in, pretty much.</a>
00:18:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h18m10s">And we’re very, very good at figuring out
where we are in the troop.</a>
00:18:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h18m16s">And by ‘we’ I mean primates.</a>
00:18:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h18m19s">I mean that’s going back a very, very long
period of time.</a>
00:18:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h18m22s">You know, monkeys and chimpanzees have very
sophisticated knowledge of the social structures</a>
00:18:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h18m27s">surrounding them.</a>
00:18:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h18m28s">They know who’s who, and they know what
status they are, they know what rank they</a>
00:18:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h18m32s">are, essentially.</a>
00:18:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h18m34s">And that’s also the case with people.</a>
00:18:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h18m37s">And so one of the things you might say about
people is that our reality isn’t nature,</a>
00:18:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h18m42s">exactly.</a>
00:18:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h18m43s">It’s culture.</a>
00:18:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h18m45s">Now, you can make the argument that you can’t
really distinguish nature from culture, and</a>
00:18:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h18m50s">I believe that that’s true and untrue, in
a sense.</a>
00:18:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h18m56s">I think you can talk about the human and non-human
elements of reality.</a>
00:18:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h19m01s">And you can identify the human elements of
reality as culture, even though culture is</a>
00:19:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h19m06s">so old that you can also think about it as
an inevitable part of nature.</a>
00:19:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h19m11s">So anyway, so most of our experience in our
evolutionary past, at least let’s say for</a>
00:19:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h19m19s">the last several million years, we might as
well go back to when the ancestors of humans</a>
00:19:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h19m24s">hypothetically split off from the ancestors
of chimpanzees.</a>
00:19:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h19m31s">And people know very accurately when these
sorts of splits occur, by the way, because</a>
00:19:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h19m36s">what they do is they have some sense of the
rate of transformation of DNA.</a>
00:19:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h19m40s">You know it transforms and the rate is fairly
constant across time.</a>
00:19:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h19m44s">And so if you take two creatures and you determine
how much genetic similarity there is between</a>
00:19:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h19m50s">them, and how much difference, you could calculate
how far back they diverged.</a>
00:19:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h19m56s">And so, the fossil record helps with that,
although it’s very sparse.</a>
00:19:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h19m59s">But the DNA record is not very sparse at all,
in some sense, so you can be very accurate</a>
00:19:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h20m04s">about it.</a>
00:20:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h20m05s">We can even tell when people evolved or learned
to wear clothing, and the reason we can tell</a>
00:20:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h20m11s">that is because there’s certain kinds of
lice that can only live on clothing, and they</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h20m15s">seem to have diverged from the lice that live
in hair about 50,000 years ago, something</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h20m20s">like that.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h20m21s">And so the hypothesis is that, well, we must
have been figuring out how to wear clothes</a>
00:20:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h20m25s">at that point because the lice figured out
how to live in them.</a>
00:20:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h20m27s">So, you know, it probably took them a little
while, but I doubt if it took them very long.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h20m31s">You know those little creatures that breed
fast, man those things can evolve quickly,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h20m38s">So okay, so a big part of the experiential
field of advanced primates is the social world.</a>
00:20:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h20m46s">And so we could call that the primate world.</a>
00:20:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h20m48s">And we could also say that another big part
of their experience is the non-primate world,</a>
00:20:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h20m53s">which would be, roughly speaking, the natural
world.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h20m56s">And then we could also say that the other

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h21m07s">And we don’t know much about the subjective

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h21m13s">you can understand, I think, the subjective

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h21m19s">And so you have some insight.</a>
00:21:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h21m21s">And I think it’s also reasonable to assume
that…</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h21m25s">I mean for a long time people were unwilling
to admit that animals had a soul, that was</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h21m29s">the first problem.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h21m30s">But after that, that they were conscious.</a>
00:21:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h21m32s">And even the behaviourists fought that notion.</a>
00:21:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h21m34s">But I think the simplest thing to do is to
assume that animals and human beings are the</a>
00:21:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h21m40s">same, except when you can prove that they’re
different.</a>
00:21:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h21m42s">Because we share so much of our evolutionary
past then the logical inference is that if</a>
00:21:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h21m46s">you think a dog is doing something sort of
like you would do in that situation, and feeling</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h21m51s">that way, it probably is, with certain exceptions
for species difference.</a>
00:21:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h21m55s">And if that wasn’t the case I don’t think
that you could have a relationship with the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h22m01s">You can’t have much of a relationship with
a lizard, although there are lizards, bearded</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h22m11s">And you can actually have more of a relationship
with them.</a>
00:22:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h22m13s">And apparently the same is true for iguanas.</a>
00:22:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h22m16s">So you can go quite a ways backwards in evolutionary
time, and still have enough similarity between</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h22m24s">you and the creature that you’re interacting
with, so you can get a pretty good sense of</a>
00:22:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h22m28s">at least some element of their being.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h22m31s">And so, the idea that subjective, or subjectivity,
is a very ancient part of our experience,</a>
00:22:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h22m38s">seems to me to be a perfectly reasonable supposition.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h22m41s">We certainly know that it’s been around,
in all likelihood, for at least 150,000 years</a>
00:22:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h22m46s">(on the conservative side), because there
have been human beings that are essentially</a>
00:22:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h22m51s">identical to us, from a genetic perspective,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h22m56s">But I think you’d have to be a pretty harsh
judge to assume that higher-order primates</a>
00:22:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h23m01s">like chimps don’t have some consciousness.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h23m09s">You know, if you mark a chimp’s nose with
lipstick and then show it a mirror, it will,</a>
00:23:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h23m15s">at least sometimes, take the lipstick off
its nose.</a>
00:23:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h23m18s">Although I’ve seen a gorilla try to fight

00:23:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h23m21s">Well no, I haven’t personally seen that,
but I’ve seen a very good video of that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h23m27s">But I think the gorilla in it would eventually
figure out that it was him in the mirror.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h23m33s">Dogs will recognise a dog in the mirror, but
they seem to ignore their reflection very,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h23m39s">very rapidly.</a>
00:23:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h23m40s">And I don’t know if that means that they

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h23m44s">and that they figure out that that dog is
them, or if the dog just doesn’t smell like</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h23m49s">a dog, and then the dog thinks “well it
can’t be a dog because it doesn’t smell</a>
00:23:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h23m53s">like a dog”.</a>
00:23:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h23m54s">And dogs probably think that something is
a dog because of how it smells, and not because</a>
00:23:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h23m58s">of how it looks.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h24m01s">I think that’s why dogs don’t seem to
have any sense of relative size.</a>
00:24:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h24m05s">Because you can get a little Chihuahua barking
like mad at a Great Dane and you think, really?</a>
00:24:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h24m11s">That’s going to work, is it?</a>
00:24:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h24m13s">But the dog doesn’t seem to have a clue
about that, like he’s perfectly happy.</a>
00:24:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h24m17s">And the Great Dane, weirdly enough, will often
back off.</a>
00:24:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h24m21s">Anyway, okay, so we’ve been in a social
world, a deeply social world for a long time,</a>
00:24:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h24m31s">and I’m also going to make the presupposition
that we’ve been in the stratified social</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h24m36s">And I think you could call that, if you wanted
to, and I would never want to, by the way,</a>
00:24:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h24m41s">you could call that the patriarchy.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h24m45s">I think that I wouldn’t call it that because
that’s not what it is.</a>
00:24:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h24m50s">But I think that the fact that it’s called
that, and that that’s accepted as a reasonable</a>
00:24:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h24m58s">representation is actually a consequence of
the action of an archetype.</a>
00:24:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h25m02s">And the archetype is that, it’s the archetype
of the terrible Great Father, actually.</a>
00:25:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h25m08s">Because you think, well there’s a social
structure with striations in it, and that</a>
00:25:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h25m12s">has advantages and disadvantages.</a>
00:25:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h25m13s">And the advantages are that you can live in
it.</a>
00:25:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h25m16s">And the disadvantages are that you have to
follow the damn rules, and they might not</a>
00:25:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h25m20s">necessarily be to your individual benefit.</a>
00:25:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h25m22s">So, within a social dominance hierarchy, there’s
always a bifurcated, it also always has bifurcated</a>
00:25:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h25m30s">significance.</a>
00:25:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h25m31s">It can be good, and is good, insofar as it
protects you from, say, from threat from without,</a>
00:25:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h25m38s">maybe from other primates invading your territory,
for example.</a>
00:25:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h25m42s">But it can also be a very dismal structure
if you happen to be at the bottom of the hierarchy.</a>
00:25:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h25m49s">So anyways, as far as I can tell, that dominance
structure is typically represented as masculine.</a>
00:25:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h25m59s">And I think the reason for that, although
I’m not absolutely certain of this, I think</a>
00:25:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h26m04s">the reason for that is that our social hierarchies
are probably more like chimp social hierarchies</a>
00:26:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h26m09s">than they are like bonobo social hierarchies.</a>
00:26:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h26m11s">So, the bonobos are kind of a strange breed
of chimps.</a>
00:26:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h26m14s">I don’t know how many of you know about
them.</a>
00:26:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h26m16s">But the bonobos are extraordinarily sexual
and they use sex, pretty much as a standard</a>
00:26:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h26m24s">means of communication and tension reduction.</a>
00:26:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h26m27s">And there’s a lot of sex between the females
and the bonobo troops, and the use of sex</a>
00:26:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h26m34s">seems to bond them together in a way that
keeps male aggression under control, which</a>
00:26:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h26m38s">is quite interesting.</a>
00:26:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h26m39s">But in the chimps the fundamental dominance
hierarchy is male, although there’s a female</a>
00:26:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h26m45s">dominance hierarchy as well, and some females
can certainly be more dominant than some males.</a>
00:26:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h26m51s">But the fundamental structure seems to be
male.</a>
00:26:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h26m53s">And then I would also say, well, it’s probably
dependent to some degree in the primate community,</a>
00:26:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h27m00s">and in other social animals, on other factors.</a>
00:27:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h27m03s">So we know, for example, that the gender that
has the highest level of testosterone tends</a>
00:27:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h27m10s">to be the dominant gender.</a>
00:27:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h27m12s">And so in hyenas the females actually have
a higher level of testosterone.</a>
00:27:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h27m16s">They’re actually bigger and more aggressive
than the males, and the price they pay for</a>
00:27:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h27m19s">that is that they have to give birth through
a structure that’s very much like a penis,</a>
00:27:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h27m23s">which is not the world’s most pleasant experience,
and might account for the hyenas’ temper.</a>
00:27:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h27m29s">But, in human beings, you know, you see sexual
dimorphism.</a>
00:27:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h27m34s">Men are slightly bigger than women, and that’s
also generally characteristic of creatures</a>
00:27:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h27m40s">that have a dominance hierarchy that’s tilted
towards masculine.</a>
00:27:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h27m44s">And then the other factor seems to be that
human beings have… our infants have very,</a>
00:27:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h27m52s">very, very, very long periods of dependence,
and it’s very difficult to manoeuver your</a>
00:27:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h28m00s">way, doing anything, really, especially anything
that has to do with competition and power,</a>
00:28:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h28m06s">if you’re taking care of one infant, let
alone three.</a>
00:28:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h28m12s">And so, it seems to me that those are all
valid reasons why the primary power structures</a>
00:28:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h28m22s">among human beings have typically been male,
and why they’re represented as masculine.</a>
00:28:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h28m27s">Now there are other reasons too, because this
is a multi-faceted phenomenon.</a>
00:28:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h28m31s">I mean, one of the things that’s interesting
about human females is that they’re selective</a>
00:28:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h28m37s">maters.</a>
00:28:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h28m38s">Now chimp females are not selective maters,
and what that means is that the dominant males</a>
00:28:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h28m43s">still have most of the offspring, but the
reason for that, apparently, is because they</a>
00:28:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h28m46s">chase the subordinate males away from sexually
receptive females.</a>
00:28:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h28m51s">Although the sexually receptive females will
sneak off behind the rocks somewhere and mate</a>
00:28:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h28m55s">with the subordinate male.</a>
00:28:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h28m58s">But as long as the dominant male is around
the probability of that is quite low.</a>
00:28:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h29m03s">So the female chimps aren’t sexually selective,
whereas human females have concealed ovulation,</a>
00:29:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h29m08s">so that no one knows when they’re at their
most fertile, and they’re selective maters.</a>
00:29:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h29m13s">And women in every society virtually, that’s
ever been studies, have a typical pattern</a>
00:29:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h29m18s">of behaviour, which is that if you look at
the female dominance hierarchy and you look</a>
00:29:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h29m22s">at the male dominance hierarchy, the females
will mate across and up dominance hierarchies,</a>
00:29:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h29m27s">and the males will mate across and down.</a>
00:29:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h29m30s">Which works fine for both genders, because
their interests align.</a>
00:29:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h29m35s">But it also means that in all likelihood women
have exerted tremendous sexual selection pressure</a>
00:29:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h29m42s">on men, and that might be part of the reason,
of the many reasons, that we actually… you</a>
00:29:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h29m47s">know the theory is that the common ancestor
between chimps and humans was probably a lot</a>
00:29:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h29m51s">more like a chimp, a modern chimp, than like
a modern human.</a>
00:29:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h29m55s">So for whatever reason, we’ve undergone
a lot more transformation in the last 7 million</a>
00:29:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h29m59s">years than chimps have.</a>
00:29:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h30m01s">And one possible reason for that, and I think
it’s a highly probable reason, is that sexual</a>
00:30:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h30m06s">selection operated a lot more viciously, so
to speak, among humans.</a>
00:30:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h30m11s">It’s operated to the point where you have
twice as many female ancestors as male.</a>
00:30:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h30m16s">And you might think, well that can’t be
possible, but here’s how it’s possible.</a>
00:30:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h30m20s">It’s like, only every second man has children,
had a child, while all women had one.</a>
00:30:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h30m26s">Now of course, that isn’t what happened,
but on average that’s what happened.</a>
00:30:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h30m30s">So the proportion of men who are completely
childless in any given generation is far higher</a>
00:30:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h30m36s">than the proportion of women who are.</a>
00:30:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h30m39s">So you see an element of expendability in
males, and that’s typical across the biological</a>
00:30:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h30m45s">community, because you don’t need as many
males as you need females in order to keep</a>
00:30:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h30m48s">the population moving forward.</a>
00:30:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h30m52s">And one of the things that happens as a consequence
of that, at least in principle, is that males</a>
00:30:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h30m55s">are more behaviourally variable and variable
across a lot of dimensions, than females are.</a>
00:30:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h31m01s">And that’s a plus, because they’re more
variable on the upside, but it’s also negative</a>
00:31:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h31m05s">because they’re more prevalent on the downside.</a>
00:31:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h31m09s">Now there’s some substantial argument about
that in relationship to people, what the actual</a>
00:31:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h31m13s">implications of that are for human beings.</a>
00:31:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h31m18s">One potential implication is that although
women and men have equivalent IQs, the standard</a>
00:31:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h31m24s">deviation is slightly different.</a>
00:31:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h31m26s">Which means that there are more males who
are intellectually impaired, but there are</a>
00:31:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h31m30s">also more males who are four and five standard
deviations above the population mean.</a>
00:31:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h31m35s">You don’t need much of a difference in standard
deviation in order to produce radical differences</a>
00:31:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h31m40s">at the extreme.</a>
00:31:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h31m42s">So I’ll give you an example.</a>
00:31:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h31m45s">Males are more aggressive than females among
humans, but the effect is only about half</a>
00:31:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h31m50s">a standard deviation.</a>
00:31:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h31m52s">And so what that means is that, if you take
a female and a male randomly from a population</a>
00:31:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h31m59s">and you were trying to guess who was the more
aggressive of the two, most of the time, you</a>
00:31:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h32m04s">know about 60% of the time, the male would
be more aggressive than the female, but 40%</a>
00:32:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h32m10s">of the time it would be reversed.</a>
00:32:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h32m11s">So you know, that’s a lot of overlap.</a>
00:32:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h32m13s">But then here’s the rub.</a>
00:32:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h32m17s">So let’s say just for example, that among
the population of men and women combined,</a>
00:32:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h32m22s">only the most aggressive person out of a hundred
ends up in jail.</a>
00:32:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h32m28s">Those are all men.</a>
00:32:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h32m29s">Because that tilt towards aggression is enough,
so that when you go way out on the distribution,</a>
00:32:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h32m35s">the only people who are that extreme are men,
even though the population difference isn’t</a>
00:32:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h32m39s">that great.</a>
00:32:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h32m40s">So anyways, there’s a massive debate in
the relevant literature about the potential</a>
00:32:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h32m47s">consequences of that for things like cognitive
function, because there’s some indication</a>
00:32:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h32m51s">as well that men are more cognitively specialised
but women are more cognitively robust.</a>
00:32:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h32m56s">Anyways, it doesn’t really matter.</a>
00:32:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h33m00s">But what does matter is the fact of this permanent
dominance hierarchy.</a>
00:33:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h33m04s">Now, the dominance hierarchy, the male dominance
hierarchy, also has another feature.</a>
00:33:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h33m10s">So we already said that, you know, on average,
men are half as likely to leave offspring</a>
00:33:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h33m15s">as women are.</a>
00:33:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h33m17s">And so what that means is that all things
considered… this isn’t…</a>
00:33:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h33m23s">I’m not trying to make this into a circular
argument.</a>
00:33:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h33m28s">Because I could say it’s the more successful
males that leave more offspring.</a>
00:33:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h33m31s">But then you’d say, well that’s the definition,
Darwinian definition, of success.</a>
00:33:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h33m34s">But I don’t mean Darwinian success, because
that’s self-evident.</a>
00:33:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h33m39s">What I mean is, if you look in the modern
world for example, and you try to predict</a>
00:33:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h33m44s">number of available sexual partners for a
given male, your best predictive measure of</a>
00:33:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h33m50s">that is income.</a>
00:33:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h33m53s">And the best predictive measure of that is
intelligence and conscientiousness.</a>
00:33:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h33m57s">And so, what happens is that males orient
themselves in groups, and then they compete.</a>
00:33:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h34m04s">And then women peel off the top.</a>
00:34:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h34m07s">And so the women are in a position of judgment
on men, and the judgment is the judgment of</a>
00:34:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h34m13s">nature.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h34m14s">Now, from a Darwinian perspective… you know,
when we think of nature we think of, well</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h34m35s">But, from a Darwinian perspective, you can
define nature much more straight-forwardly,</a>
00:34:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h34m41s">and more accurately, as that which selects.</a>
00:34:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h34m44s">Now, you know, you hear a lot about natural
selection, and natural selection basically</a>
00:34:44</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h35m00s">And some of those random alterations will
be more suited to that particular environment,</a>

the millennia as the organism chases the landscape,</a>
00:35:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h35m16s">roughly speaking.</a>
00:35:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h35m17s">But Darwin, you know, Darwin, who was an unbelievably
intelligent person, was also very, very interested</a>
00:35:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h35m25s">in sexual selection, and as far as Darwin
was concerned, sexual selection was just as</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h35m30s">powerful in modifying genetic structure, in
driving evolution, as natural selection.</a>
00:35:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h35m38s">And that’s been very underplayed by biologists.</a>
00:35:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h35m41s">That’s only started to switch in the last…</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h35m44s">I would say it hasn’t switched that much
yet, but it started to switch probably in</a>
00:35:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h35m49s">about the last 25 years.</a>
00:35:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h35m51s">And that’s because the idea of sexual selection
makes things a hell of a lot more complicated.</a>
00:35:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h35m58s">Because, well first of all, in a standard
Darwinian account of evolution, there’s</a>
00:35:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h36m04s">no place for mind, there’s no place for
a creator, there’s no place for teleology.</a>
00:36:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h36m08s">And teleology is something moving towards
an end, a goal, right?</a>
00:36:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h36m14s">But the thing is, if sexual selection is operative,
and if consciousness is ancient, then mind</a>
00:36:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h36m22s">has been operating through sexual selection
as long as there’s been sexual selection.</a>
00:36:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h36m27s">So you think, do you have any choice, do you
make any choice in who your sexual partner</a>
00:36:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h36m34s">will be?</a>
00:36:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h36m35s">And the answer to that is, well it’s hardly
random, you make a choice!</a>
00:36:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h36m41s">And what’s interesting is that, you know,
if you take 60 people, let’s say if you</a>
00:36:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h36m46s">took 60 women, and you showed them a bunch
of men, and you asked them to rank them in</a>
00:36:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h36m49s">terms of their attractiveness, there’s going
to be very consistent rankings.</a>
00:36:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h36m53s">You know, I mean, we know what makes up attractive
facial features, for women and for men, it’s</a>
00:36:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h36m58s">easy to determine that.</a>
00:36:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h36m59s">What you do is you take 60 faces and you average
the features.</a>
00:36:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h37m05s">So you don’t get the average person, because
the average person is more like a median,</a>
00:37:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h37m09s">you get the averaged person.</a>
00:37:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h37m11s">And the averaged person has perfectly symmetrical
features that are nicely shaped, and fairly</a>
00:37:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h37m16s">big eyes, and they’re very nice-looking,
they’re very attractive.</a>
00:37:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h37m22s">And so, that means that there’s like a central
human form, in a sense, that we find attractive.</a>
00:37:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h37m29s">And we see this in other species, for example
there are butterflies who won’t mate with</a>
00:37:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h37m33s">another butterfly if it’s like a sixteenth
of an inch out of symmetry, because it’s</a>
00:37:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h37m39s">not a butterfly of that type, you know.</a>
00:37:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h37m41s">And that’s how people think too, if you
deviate from the averaged person, the less</a>
00:37:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h37m47s">canonically human you appear, and the less
attractive you appear.</a>
00:37:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h37m51s">And, you know, we’re chasing this ideal
in some sense that’s an emergent property</a>
00:37:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h37m55s">of the nature of our species.</a>
00:37:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h37m57s">And then, you know, there’s certain physical
characteristics, wide shoulders in men, and</a>
00:37:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h38m04s">narrow waists.</a>
00:38:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h38m05s">In women, it’s waist-to-hip ratio, a very
common marker of beauty, across cultures,</a>
00:38:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h38m10s">and across body types, interestingly enough.</a>
00:38:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h38m13s">So, if you take thin women and heavier women,
and you get men to rate the attractiveness</a>
00:38:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h38m18s">of the women within that category, the heavy
women and the light women who have a waist-to-hip</a>
00:38:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h38m23s">ratio of about 0.68 are the ones that are
judged most attractive physically.</a>
00:38:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h38m27s">And so, that actually correlates, by the way,
with fertility, because the abdominal fat</a>
00:38:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h38m33s">in a young woman is a sign of ill health and
also a marker of decreased likelihood of conception.</a>
00:38:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h38m38s">Now none of this is operating consciously,
obviously, it’s deeply wired into us, it’s</a>
00:38:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h38m43s">part of our mediate perception.</a>
00:38:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h38m46s">But it still does indicate that there’s
an ideal, like a platonic ideal, lurking at</a>
00:38:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h38m52s">the back of our minds, against whom we compare
everyone that we meet.</a>
00:38:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h38m56s">And then you might say, well what’s the
nature of that platonic ideal, and that’s</a>
00:38:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h39m00s">a very, very complicated question.</a>
00:39:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h39m03s">You know, I would say that you could almost
literally claim that the… well you can certainly</a>
00:39:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h39m13s">claim that the ideal male is represented in
mythology as a hero.</a>
00:39:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h39m22s">And that’s actually what mythology is about,
it’s about representing ideal patterns of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h39m25s">behaviour, so it’s hardly surprising.</a>
00:39:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h39m28s">And so, you know, if you go to a movie, and
it’s a romance, and there’s the main lead</a>
00:39:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h39m33s">character that you’re supposed to fall in

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h39m44s">particular pattern of behaviour.</a>
00:39:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h39m45s">And the pattern of behaviour is quite identifiable.</a>
00:39:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h39m48s">So for example he’s going to move forward
and explore, and not hide and cower.</a>
00:39:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h39m53s">And the probability that he’s going to be
creative is very high, and the probability</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h39m56s">that he’s going to be good-looking and strong
is very high.</a>
00:39:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h40m00s">And so, those are archetypal features.</a>
00:40:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h40m03s">And those aren’t all the archetypal features,
because those are, in some sense, those are</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h40m09s">the self-evident ones.</a>
00:40:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h40m11s">But you know, people are also evaluating each
other for things like intelligence, and personality,</a>
00:40:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h40m16s">and character.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h40m18s">And you could say in some sense that men are

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h40m24s">watching the competition to take the man who

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h40m31s">It’s a very, very intelligent strategy.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h40m36s">Let the men sort it out, well as I say, it’s
too cognitively complex to compute.</a>
00:40:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h40m42s">You could say that the male dominance hierarchy
is equivalent to the stock market.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h40m48s">The stocks are always competing with one another,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h40m54s">of price and value, and that’s exactly what

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h40m59s">So one of the things that we’ve just discovered
in my lab, this is Caitlyn Burton’s work,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h41m04s">it’s very cool, is that we took… we were

00:41:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h41m13s">And I’m going to speak in terms of conservatism,
because that’s how we construed the data,</a>
00:41:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h41m18s">although we could’ve done the reverse if

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h41m21s">And what we did was we took, we got a bunch

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h41m34s">We had a lot of people generate them and take
them from news items and so forth, because</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h41m38s">we didn’t want any bias in the initial question

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h41m42s">Or we didn’t want a bias that wasn’t there
in the actual world.</a>
00:41:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h41m48s">So we had many people do this, and then we
gave these questions to many, many people</a>
00:41:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h41m53s">online, in a variety of stages.</a>
00:41:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h41m56s">And we extracted those out that seemed to
best fit the data, and then assessed them</a>
00:41:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h42m03s">for the utility in predicting things like
party membership or voting behaviour.</a>
00:42:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h42m07s">And so we got a good structure, it makes a
lot of sense, and what we found with regards</a>
00:42:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h42m11s">to conservatism was that there was an ethnocentrism
factor, it was the third and weakest factor,</a>
00:42:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h42m18s">and that would be associated with in-group
preference vs. out-group derogation.</a>
00:42:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h42m23s">So those are anti-immigrant people, fundamentally,
you know, and they’re, well they’re ethnocentric.</a>
00:42:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h42m29s">That’s the simplest way to explain it.</a>
00:42:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h42m36s">And then the second smallest factor was religious
traditionalism.</a>
00:42:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h42m42s">And most of this was done with Americans,
for a variety of reasons.</a>
00:42:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h42m46s">And that was really where the fundamentalist
Christians nested.</a>
00:42:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h42m49s">And not everyone… that was not only a factor
made up of fundamentalist Christian beliefs,</a>
00:42:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h42m57s">but they loaded heavily.</a>
00:42:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h42m59s">Those were people who weren’t for stem cell
research, they were anti-abortion, they were</a>
00:42:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h43m04s">anti-gay marriage.</a>
00:43:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h43m06s">Or they were pro-traditional, which is how
they see themselves.</a>
00:43:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h43m10s">And then, the largest factor was a factor
that we called ‘masculine independence’.</a>
00:43:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h43m19s">And it was more characteristic of men, and
what it basically consisted of was an attitude</a>
00:43:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h43m25s">that winners win and losers lose, and that’s
just how it should be.</a>
00:43:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h43m28s">So it was the men who… the personality predictors,
one of them was extroverted assertiveness…</a>
00:43:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h43m36s">hunting and the right to own firearms also
loaded on this factor, but it was masculine</a>
00:43:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h43m44s">competitiveness, I think, is the best way
of thinking about it.</a>
00:43:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h43m48s">And I think it’s a good illustration of
the kind of individual attitude that makes</a>
00:43:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h43m56s">you more likely to attempt to climb up dominance
hierarchies and dominate them from the top</a>
00:43:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h44m00s">down.</a>
00:44:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h44m01s">And that’s not necessarily something that
would be associated with factors like compassion.</a>
00:44:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h44m05s">Well, I’ll leave it at that.</a>
00:44:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h44m09s">It’s just that you can see…</a>
00:44:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h44m11s">I’m telling you that because you can see
how these proclivities manifest themselves</a>
00:44:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h44m16s">in all sorts of areas of behaviour.</a>
00:44:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h44m18s">I can tell you something else that’s very
interesting about men and violence.</a>
00:44:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h44m25s">I don’t know if I can get this story straight
because it’s been a while since I told it.</a>
00:44:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h44m39s">So there’s this interesting phenomenon,
that’s very characteristic of societies,</a>
00:44:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h44m46s">I believe pretty much everywhere it’s been
studied.</a>
00:44:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h44m50s">Now, you can calculate an index called the
Gini coefficient.</a>
00:44:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h44m54s">And the Gini coefficient is a number that
represents how much inequality of income distribution</a>
00:44:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h45m00s">there is in a given geographical area.</a>
00:45:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h45m03s">So you could calculate a Gini coefficient
for a street or an area in a city, or a city,</a>
00:45:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h45m09s">or a state, or a country, you can do it at
all those levels.</a>
00:45:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h45m13s">And what you find is that, you know you always
hear this idea that poverty causes crime.</a>
00:45:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h45m18s">That’s a classic left-wing idea.</a>
00:45:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h45m20s">But it’s wrong, it’s seriously wrong.</a>
00:45:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h45m24s">And it’s importantly wrong.</a>
00:45:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h45m25s">And it’s definitively wrong, not only that.</a>
00:45:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h45m29s">So there’s no argument about this, it’s
already been established.</a>
00:45:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h45m33s">What causes crime, especially aggressive crime,
is relative poverty, and relative poverty</a>
00:45:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h45m38s">is not the same thing as poverty at all.</a>
00:45:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h45m40s">It’s seriously not the same thing.</a>
00:45:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h45m42s">Poverty is when you don’t have enough to
eat.</a>
00:45:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h45m44s">Relative poverty is when the guy next door
has a much better car than you.</a>
00:45:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h45m49s">And there’s lots of relative poverty in
the United States, and there’s some absolute</a>
00:45:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h45m52s">poverty, but even the absolute poverty in
the United States is nothing like the absolute</a>
00:45:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h45m57s">poverty say in places like India or sub-Saharan
Africa, where absolute poverty means you have</a>
00:45:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h46m02s">nothing.</a>
00:46:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h46m03s">Now, what’s really interesting about the
Gini coefficient is that if you go to places</a>
00:46:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h46m09s">where everyone, roughly speaking, is poor,
say by national standards…</a>
00:46:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h46m15s">I think South Dakota was often used as an
example, or maybe one of the Maritime Provinces…</a>
00:46:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h46m21s">like Newfoundland, where there’s low average
income but it’s pretty flat distribution,</a>
00:46:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h46m26s">there’s almost no crime.</a>
00:46:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h46m29s">And if you go to places where everyone’s
rich then </a>
00:46:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h46m34s">But if you go places where there’s poor
people and moderately well-off people, and</a>
00:46:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h46m40s">rich people, and the distribution is really
steep, then the rate of aggressive behaviour</a>
00:46:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h46m45s">among young men, and it’s usually within
their own ethnic group, starts to sky-rocket</a>
00:46:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h46m50s">out of control.</a>
00:46:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h46m52s">And the reason for that seems to be that,
if the dominance hierarchy is too steep, then</a>
00:46:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h46m57s">the young men have no likelihood of climbing
to a dominant position while playing the standard</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h47m04s">And so what they do is turn to aggression,
to make their mark on the world.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h47m09s">And it works, too, that’s the other thing.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h47m12s">Make no mistake about it, if you’re looking

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h47m26s">It works.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h47m28s">Would that be part of the reason why… because

00:49:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h49m32s">and the reason they want to climb the dominance

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h49m33s">I was going to, actually ask earlier in the

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h49m47s">So it seems like we all want to live within
a structure, but we don’t want the rules</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h49m53s">Well, we have this contradictory problem,
we want to be protected by the structure but</a>
00:49:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h49m56s">we want to advance our position within it.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h50m04s">behaviour, is that you’re allowed to advance

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h50m14s">In fact I think people in civilised countries

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h50m51s">So I mean, why… see, you might… here’s
a reason… you know, because one of the things</a>
00:50:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h51m02s">we were talking about is masculine violence.</a>
00:51:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h51m04s">Now the thing about masculine violence is
that it only tends to emerge in situations</a>
00:51:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h51m08s">where there don’t seem to be any other reasonably
viable means of advancing status.</a>
00:51:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h51m16s">So it’s not reasonable to say that men are
aggressive.</a>
00:51:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h51m20s">You can say that on average men are more aggressive
than women.</a>
00:51:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h51m23s">And you can also say that if you put men in
a situation where they have no, where they</a>
00:51:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h51m30s">can see status differences but they have no
means of moving forward, that they’re likely</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h51m40s">And then you can say that, the reason for
that is that it makes them more attractive,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h51m47s">Yeah?</a>
00:51:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h51m48s">Yeah, I’d just like to add on, I read this
article once that talks about how polygamous</a>
00:51:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h52m01s">societies are more violent than monogamous

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h52m02s">Yeah, absolutely.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h52m03s">I was going to say maybe it’s because when
one guy has two wives that means that 50%</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h52m04s">of the population has no wives, no access
to sex.</a>
00:52:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h52m05s">Yeah that’s exactly right, the evolutionary
psychology explanation for the pathology of</a>
00:52:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h52m08s">polygamy is that once you let it establish
itself then then men get ultra-violent.</a>
00:52:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h52m12s">So would you say that monogamy would almost
be a basis for civilised society?</a>
00:52:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h52m18s">Many people have said that, and yes I think
you can make a strong case for that.</a>
00:52:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h52m22s">And I think the fundamental reason is the
one you just pointed out.</a>
00:52:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h52m25s">You know the idea is, well, would you rather
have one woman, or die, you know?</a>
00:52:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h52m34s">Sorry no, that’s not quite right.</a>
00:52:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h52m38s">It’s more like, would you be willing to
limit yourself to one partner or have a shot</a>
00:52:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h52m44s">at many partners but a much higher probability
of dying.</a>
00:52:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h52m47s">Right, and you know, some guys will take that.</a>
00:52:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h52m50s">They’ll take the high-risk approach.</a>
00:52:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h52m54s">So now, this doesn’t eliminate the difference
in individual differences in determining who’s</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h53m00s">going to be aggressive, because what will
happen is that as the Gini coefficient pressure</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h53m05s">rises, the more aggressive men, the men who
are more aggressive by nature, will get more</a>
00:53:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h53m10s">aggressive first.</a>
00:53:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h53m11s">So you can imagine, it’s a threshold phenomenon,
in some sense.</a>
00:53:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h53m15s">And what I should tell you as well is that
the relationship between the Gini coefficient</a>
00:53:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h53m19s">and male-on-male homicide isn’t 0.2 or 0.3,
which is the correlation that you’d get</a>
00:53:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h53m26s">if you were predicting something like that
using personality.</a>
00:53:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h53m29s">It’s like 0.8 or 0.9.</a>
00:53:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h53m31s">It’s like it eats up all of it, it’s the
explanation.</a>
00:53:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h53m35s">So it’s a huge effect, it’s so big an
effect that you can basically say that oh</a>
00:53:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h53m40s">well, we figured that out.</a>
00:53:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h53m41s">Although psychologists never know when they’ve
figured anything out, and they keep endlessly</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h54m21s">I mean, the methodologically sophisticated

00:54:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h54m33s">So countries with a higher Gini coefficient
are more violent, and cities within that country</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h55m36s">So I guess part of the reason I’m telling
you that, come to think of it, is that I think</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h55m53s">Okay, so back to sexual selection.</a>
00:55:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h55m58s">Now, we already talked about the fact that
biologists perhaps were uncomfortable with</a>
00:55:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h56m04s">the idea of sexual selection, because it brings
a non-random factor into evolution.</a>
00:56:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h56m10s">A seriously non-random factor, because you
have to go back as far as you can in history</a>
00:56:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h56m17s">to where there was no choice, on the part
of the organism, to attribute evolution to</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h56m24s">And you have to go back a long ways back,
as I said, even butterflies are perfectly</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h56m28s">capable of distinguishing between a high-quality

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h56m33s">a low-quality butterfly partner.</a>
00:56:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h56m34s">And you know, insects have been around for
a very, very long time.</a>
00:56:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h56m40s">So we have no idea, what that actually means
is that we have no idea what role choice has</a>
00:56:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h56m45s">made in the evolutionary process.</a>
00:56:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h56m48s">But one thing that you can infer is that the
reason human beings are the way they are now,</a>
00:56:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h56m52s">and not like chimps or human ancestors, is
because the sexual selection process got started,</a>
00:56:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h57m00s">and it was intense.</a>
00:57:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h57m02s">And so, as a consequence of that, here we
are.</a>
00:57:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h57m05s">And so, you know, maybe it was a good thing.</a>
00:57:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h57m07s">Although it’s very hard, in some sense,
on all those people who failed.</a>
00:57:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h57m10s">And that’s, you know, roughly speaking,
twice as many men as women.</a>
00:57:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h57m17s">So then that all raises the question, like
who exactly is responsible for the male dominance</a>
00:57:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h57m23s">hierarchy?</a>
00:57:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h57m24s">Because you could say it’s male competitiveness,
but you could also say, yeah well it’s an</a>
00:57:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h57m27s">inevitable function of female selection.</a>
00:57:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h57m30s">Which is not an argument that you hear very
often.</a>
00:57:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h57m33s">But I think it’s a very difficult argument
to escape from.</a>
00:57:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h57m36s">And that leads us to our next hypothesis.</a>
00:57:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h57m37s">So we’re going to say that the masculine
dominance hierarchy is represented as masculine.</a>
00:57:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h57m43s">I’m going to call that The Great Father
for the time being.</a>
00:57:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h57m45s">And that’s the permanent dominance hierarchy
of men, and it’s always there, it moves</a>
00:57:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h57m51s">through history.</a>
00:57:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h57m52s">It’s different men all the time, but the
men slot in and out as they are born and die,</a>
00:57:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h57m56s">but the structure itself stays intact across…
forever.</a>
00:57:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h58m01s">It’s always there.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h58m02s">It’s been there at least for millions of
years, so for our purposes we’ll just call</a>
00:58:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h58m06s">it permanent.</a>
00:58:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h58m07s">It’s a permanent part of experience, and
it’s a big part of it.</a>
00:58:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h58m11s">And you know, as culture gets more and more…
covers larger and larger expanses of territory,</a>
00:58:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h58m18s">gets more and more sophisticated, it’s an
ever larger part of reality.</a>
00:58:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h58m22s">I mean, most of us spend almost all our time
coping with the dominance hierarchy, and almost</a>
00:58:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h58m30s">none of our time combatting nature.</a>

that’s it, you know, but most of the problems</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h58m38s">that you would face in a purely natural environment,
you’re so distant from them that you could</a>
00:58:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h58m44s">hardly imagine, you can’t even imagine what
it would be like, in some sense, to be in</a>
00:58:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h58m47s">an environment like that.</a>
00:58:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h58m48s">Yeah?</a>
00:58:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h58m49s">I have a question.</a>
00:58:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h58m50s">Like your explanation of what drives men to
become competitive and vindictive of the hierarchy…</a>
00:58:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h58m51s">what drives women?</a>
00:58:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h58m52s">Like for example there’s an aggressive nature
of women and there’s some sort of competitiveness</a>
00:58:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h58m53s">in women, let’s say at the University of
Toronto.</a>
00:58:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h58m54s">So</a>
00:58:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h59m05s">what is driving women to try to elevate their
level in the hierarchy?</a>
00:59:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h59m09s">Well, that’s a good question.</a>
00:59:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h59m10s">So the way I would answer that question is
two-fold.</a>
00:59:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h59m13s">So the question was what drives women to move
to the top of the hierarchy?</a>
00:59:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h59m19s">It’s something that’s worth discussing.</a>
00:59:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h59m24s">So if anybody objects to what I’m going
to say, then please do, because I’m not,</a>
00:59:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h59m27s">you know, dishing this out as received truth,
it’s…</a>
00:59:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h59m31s">I’ve been trying to figure this out and
this is what it looks like to me.</a>
00:59:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h59m34s">The first thing is that I think there are…
male and female dominance hierarchies both</a>
00:59:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h59m37s">exist but they’re different.</a>
00:59:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h59m40s">And that females compete with each other intensely,
but they don’t compete for the same things,</a>
00:59:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h59m45s">and they don’t compete the same way.</a>
00:59:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h59m48s">So let me tell you a little story, this is
a bit of a divergence, but it’s an interesting</a>
00:59:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h59m54s">point.</a>
00:59:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h59m55s">And one of the questions I’ve always been
asked in this class… because I’m going</a>
00:59:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=00h59m58s">to lay out a hero story, and the fundamental
hero archetype, and the hero is masculine</a>
00:59:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h00m04s">in mythology… and so the women always ask,
well what about the role of the woman?</a>
01:00:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h00m08s">And it’s like, it’s very, very complex,
which of course, all you women already know,</a>
01:00:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h00m12s">because it is very, very complex.</a>
01:00:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h00m13s">But it isn’t something that… first of
all I don’t think it’s a question that</a>
01:00:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h00m18s">would’ve been asked before the invention
of the birth control pill.</a>
01:00:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h00m22s">Because we know what the archetypal female
is, prior to that.</a>
01:00:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h00m27s">It’s the Virgin Mary with child, it’s
a virgin with child.</a>
01:00:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h00m30s">Which means that the unit for woman is ‘woman
with child’.</a>
01:00:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h00m35s">It’s not woman, it’s woman with child.</a>
01:00:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h00m38s">And, well, it’s obvious why that is, because
as soon as you become a woman, in most societies,</a>
01:00:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h00m44s">you have a child.</a>
01:00:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h00m46s">Before that, you’re a girl, and that’s,
you know, that’s in some sense irrelevant,</a>
01:00:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h00m52s">in terms of your destiny.</a>
01:00:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h00m54s">Now you might say, well what’s your archetypal
pattern if you’re not a mother?</a>
01:00:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h01m00s">Well, the way it looks to me is that there’s
two archetypes for personal development, for</a>
01:01:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h01m08s">the personal path, roughly speaking.</a>
01:01:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h01m10s">There’s the hero, and that would be the
person that explores the unknown and discovers</a>
01:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h01m15s">something of value and brings it back and
distributes it to the community.</a>
01:01:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h01m19s">So it’s like a hunting… it’s probably
predicated on a hunting platform, because</a>
01:01:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h01m27s">our bodies are hunting platforms, basically.</a>
01:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h01m31s">And one theory about what men did, which is
a very probable theory, is that they went</a>
01:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h01m36s">out and hunted for meat.</a>
01:01:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h01m37s">And chimps like meat, they’ll eat it whenever
they can, although they’re not very good</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h01m40s">hunters.</a>

say it’s a maternal archetype in a sense,</a>
01:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h02m29s">and one of the things that’s very interesting
about human males is that they’re quite</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h02m32s">maternal, by comparison to other animals.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h02m35s">So for example, the mother bear doesn’t
have the male bear, the boar… is it boars</a>
01:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h02m43s">and sows with bears?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h02m44s">I think it is.</a>

because he’ll kill them.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h02m48s">Now, not all males will do that but many will,
they don’t have any filial attachment.</a>
01:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h02m57s">And that’s the case for many but not all
complex mammals.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h03m17s">I would say they’re not as good at taking

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h03m34s">I think that switch is around the age of two
or two and a half, when the kids can engage</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h03m42s">Because men are much more likely to engage
in rough-and-tumble play than women are, and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h03m46s">rough-and-tumble play seems to be one of the

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h04m02s">And the best way to learn that is in rough-and-tumble

01:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h04m04s">Because what happens is that if you’re playing

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h04m20s">And you have to let them win fairly frequently,

01:04:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h04m59s">but they don’t have an embodied sense of

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h05m04s">Because often a young child, if they’re

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h05m47s">Anyways, back to the archetypal representation.</a>
01:05:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h05m52s">I think really the way to think about it is
that for men, the hero archetype is the archetype</a>
01:05:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h05m58s">that’s dominant and in the forefront, and
the maternal archetype is subordinate and</a>

01:06:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h06m08s">So each of the genders can play the role of
the other gender but there’s a tilt in each</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h06m13s">of them towards the… what would you say?</a>
01:06:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h06m17s">Well I would say towards typical gender-normative
behaviour.</a>
01:06:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h06m24s">Now the social constructivists believe that
no such thing exists, but those people are</a>
01:06:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h06m28s">so pathological that even considering what
they have to say is a mistake.</a>
01:06:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h06m32s">So, you know they act as if there is no biology
and everything’s cultural, and it’s like,</a>
01:06:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h06m39s">well no, that’s just not right.</a>
01:06:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h06m42s">Now what biology means in practice and what
you should do about it, that’s a whole different</a>

as socially… height differences between</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h06m51s">men and women are not socially constructed,

maybe you guys can help me clarify this or</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h07m29s">And then three days later they were friends

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h07m37s">exactly, but the fact that they could have

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h07m46s">And the option is, the option that the men

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h09m33s">you will be physically controlled.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h09m41s">Well I don’t know the answer to that, I
don’t know what women do about that but</a>
01:09:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h09m46s">I also don’t know what men do about that

01:09:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h09m49s">So I was watching something the other day,
it was this…</a>
01:09:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h09m52s">I posted it on my Twitter account as an example
of animus possession.</a>
01:09:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h09m59s">So a woman and a man were having a dispute
on the street.</a>
01:09:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h10m03s">It was a political dispute.</a>
01:10:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h10m04s">And this particular woman, the way she was
behaving towards this particular man, was</a>
01:10:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h10m10s">such that had she been a man, and had he been
a man, he would have definitely hit her.</a>
01:10:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h10m15s">Because she was right in his face, and she
was cursing at him and swearing and calling</a>
01:10:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h10m19s">him an idiot.</a>
01:10:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h10m20s">And really being hyper-aggressive.</a>
01:10:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h10m21s">And of course, he couldn’t do anything about
it.</a>
01:10:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h10m24s">So then I was watching that and I was thinking,
just exactly what are you supposed to do in</a>
01:10:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h10m28s">a situation like that?</a>
01:10:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h10m29s">Because you’re screwed no matter what you
do.</a>
01:10:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h10m31s">If you’re on the male side, it’s like,
you certainly can’t intervene physically.</a>
01:10:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h10m36s">It’s like you’re dead in the water instantly,
instantly, in your eyes, the eyes of society,</a>
01:10:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h10m41s">and in the woman’s eyes, instantly, if you
move past the boundary.</a>
01:10:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h10m44s">If you leave, well, there’s no glory in
running away, that’s for sure.</a>
01:10:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h10m50s">So what exactly is supposed to happen?</a>
01:10:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h10m53s">I have no idea what’s supposed to happen
in a situation like that.</a>
01:10:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h10m57s">I think what happens, what will happen over
time, is that men just won’t put themselves</a>
01:10:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h11m01s">in those situations.</a>
01:11:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h11m02s">I think what the male would have to do in
that situation is behave like a woman would,</a>
01:11:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h11m09s">in a female dominance hierarchy.</a>
01:11:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h11m15s">So he stands there and takes it and afterwards
goes off and bad-mouths her to her social</a>
01:11:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h11m20s">circle.</a>
01:11:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h11m21s">That’s a form of aggression.</a>
01:11:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h11m22s">Right, right, but you know that’s definitely
not seen as an admirable form of behaviour</a>
01:11:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h11m28s">among men.</a>
01:11:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h11m29s">I mean, I don’t think it’s an admirable
form of behaviour, period.</a>
01:11:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h11m32s">But I mean, you know, aggression is often
not admirable, so that’s fine.</a>
01:11:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h11m35s">Yeah?</a>
01:11:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h11m36s">I think that when you take away emotion, like
when someone’s acting really aggressively</a>
01:11:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h11m37s">towards you and you reserve your emotion,
it gives them a lot less to feed off of, and</a>
01:11:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h11m41s">that ends up taking power away in a similar
way that aggression does.</a>
01:11:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h11m55s">Because people react aggressively and they
want feedback that gives them more excitement…</a>
01:11:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h11m59s">Oh definitely.</a>
01:11:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h12m00s">Oh yeah it would’ve been a real victory
for her if she would’ve gotten slapped.</a>
01:12:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h12m02s">Absolutely, because it would prove everything
she said instantly.</a>
01:12:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h12m06s">Yeah, but when you dismiss, power’s gone.</a>
01:12:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h12m11s">So then you have all the power.</a>
01:12:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h12m13s">Yeah, yeah.</a>
01:12:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h12m14s">Well I think that that would be a reasonably
effective strategy for a street confrontation</a>
01:12:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h12m19s">like that.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h12m20s">I’m not so sure how well it would work in
a prolonged competition inside a company,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h12m25s">for example.</a>
01:12:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h12m26s">In a hierarchy, yeah, because you know the
truth of the matter is that men have no idea</a>
01:12:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h12m34s">how to treat women if they’re in male power

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h12m39s">And that’s because we have no idea how to
do that.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h12m41s">No one has any idea how to do that.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h12m42s">It’s only been happening, in any pronounced
sense, for about, well, on a societal level,</a>
01:12:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h12m52s">really probably since the mid-70s.</a>
01:12:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h12m54s">You know, it’s three generations.</a>
01:12:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h12m56s">It’s a drop in the bucket.</a>
01:12:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h12m58s">And it’s a very, very difficult thing to
sort out.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h13m01s">So, I mean part of the reason I’ve been
thinking about these sorts of things is because</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h13m05s">I’ve been very interested in the fact that
men have been doing very badly in junior high</a>
01:13:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h13m10s">and high school, and they’re bailing out
of universities like mad.</a>
01:13:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h13m13s">At the rate it’s going there’ll be almost
no men in most disciplines within ten years.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h13m17s">I mean you can tell that even in this class.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h13m20s">It’s funny because on my YouTube videos
I look at the gender distribution for viewing</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h13m26s">and it’s 80% male, which is interesting
to me.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h13m30s">I’m not sure exactly why that is.</a>
01:13:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h13m32s">But in lots of fields it’s 80:20 women already,
and I can’t see why that won’t…</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h13m39s">I think that’ll accelerate as we move forward,
rather than slowing down.</a>

and the power hierarchy.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h13m52s">Now from a Darwinian perspective, one of the
things you might do is call whatever selects</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h14m04s">And so when we think of nature and we think
about nature from a scientific perspective,</a>
01:14:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h14m09s">we don’t even think about humans as agents

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h14m13s">We tend to think of the human being as something

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h14m17s">That’s in mythology.</a>
01:14:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h14m18s">It’s like, the human being against the natural
world, it’s a very common plot in movies</a>
01:14:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h14m24s">and stories.</a>
01:14:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h14m25s">So it’s man against nature, roughly speaking.</a>
01:14:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h14m28s">So we tend to think of those as separate categories.</a>
01:14:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h14m33s">But if women do the selection among human
beings, at least they do the intense selection,</a>
01:14:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h14m42s">then women are nature, for men.</a>
01:14:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h14m46s">And that’s exactly what the archetype is.</a>
01:14:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h14m48s">It’s Mother Nature.</a>
01:14:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h14m50s">And Mother Nature has a very vicious element,
and the vicious element of Mother Nature is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h14m56s">rejection.</a>
01:14:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h14m57s">And that can be maternal rejection, which
is, you know, certainly something that causes</a>
01:14:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h15m01s">a tremendous amount of trauma.</a>
01:15:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h15m03s">But it can also be the most fundamental form
of rejection, and the most fundamental form</a>
01:15:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h15m11s">of rejection is sexual rejection.</a>
01:15:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h15m14s">Because it means that you are judged as biologically
unworthy, roughly speaking.</a>
01:15:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h15m23s">And there’s other reasons why… so the
reason I’m telling you this is because I’ve</a>
01:15:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h15m27s">been trying to puzzle out… what you see
in mythology quite clearly is that the dominance</a>
01:15:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h15m32s">hierarchy is represented as male, so culture
is male, and nature is female.</a>
01:15:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h15m36s">Well, why the hell would nature be female?</a>
01:15:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h15m38s">It’s like, okay, well I’ve given you one
reason, and I think it’s the primary reason.</a>
01:15:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h15m42s">There’s other reasons, because nature is
also seen as that which produces natural forms,</a>
01:15:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h15m48s">and of course, women produce natural forms,
so that’s a logical association.</a>
01:15:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h15m54s">And then, what’s the other one?</a>
01:15:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h15m59s">Well, we can leave it at that for the time
being.</a>
01:15:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h16m08s">So, now let me show you how</a>
01:16:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h16m23s">I think that that’s represented.</a>
01:16:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h16m24s">I think this is the way the world is structured
when you consider it as a place of action.</a>
01:16:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h16m29s">So the world as a place of action has characters,
like the elements are characters, and the</a>
01:16:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h16m35s">characters are engaged in dramatic behaviour.</a>
01:16:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h16m41s">And there are classes of characters, and as
far as I can tell, this is a reasonably comprehensive</a>
01:16:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h16m47s">classification of dramatic characters.</a>
01:16:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h16m49s">We’ll start from the inside and go out.</a>
01:16:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h16m54s">And you can think of any of these as primary,
by the way, and you’ll see that reflected</a>
01:16:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h16m58s">in different kinds of mythology.</a>
01:16:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h16m59s">So sometimes the maternal is primary, and
sometimes the culture is primary, and sometimes</a>
01:16:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h17m05s">the hero, the individual is primary.</a>
01:17:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h17m07s">And I think that’s because these three things
are irreducibly primary.</a>
01:17:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h17m12s">In that, from the perspective of consciousness,
in that, to be conscious, there has to be</a>
01:17:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h17m17s">you, but if you’re conscious you have to
have evolved within a culture and that’s</a>
01:17:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h17m23s">culture is necessarily nested in the natural
world, and so wherever there’s one there’s</a>
01:17:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h17m28s">all three.</a>
01:17:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h17m29s">And the individual’s also the thing… without
the individual there wouldn’t be any separation</a>
01:17:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h17m34s">between nature and culture.</a>
01:17:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h17m35s">So you can see the individual consciousness
is the generator of the entire structure,</a>
01:17:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h17m39s">but you can say that about any of the characters.</a>
01:17:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h17m42s">So there’s the archetypal son, because the
hero tends to be masculine, and then, it has</a>
01:17:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h17m48s">a… that character has a positive element
and a negative element.</a>
01:17:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h17m53s">And the positive element is the good person,
and the negative element is the bad person.</a>
01:17:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h17m59s">And I would say the archetypal representations
of those are, like, the saviour, and Satan.</a>
01:17:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h18m06s">And that’s basically… there are portrayals
like that in virtually every system of mythology</a>
01:18:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h18m12s">and religion.</a>
01:18:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h18m13s">Now it seems to me that in some sense Christianity,
and this was probably under the influence</a>
01:18:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h18m17s">of the Zoroastrians, developed the most articulated
representation of good vs. evil at the individual</a>
01:18:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h18m27s">level.</a>
01:18:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h18m29s">And that’s why you can identify two fundamental
characters in the Christian story, so to speak,</a>
01:18:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h18m35s">that play out these roles.</a>
01:18:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h18m36s">And they’re seen as eternal adversaries
locked in battle across time.</a>
01:18:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h18m41s">And that would be, the battle takes place
in the natural world, the battle takes place</a>
01:18:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h18m45s">in the cultural world, and the battle takes
place within, as well.</a>
01:18:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h18m50s">And you can see that reflected in stories
all the time, because, you know, it’s so</a>
01:18:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h18m54s">frequently the case that the hero, the super-hero
has his nemesis.</a>
01:18:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h19m00s">And it’s the guy that he’s extraordinarily
well-matched with who continuously tests his</a>

01:19:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h19m09s">So you see that with Batman and the Joker,
for example, or you see that with Sherlock</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h19m15s">There’s always this pairing and that’s
partly because I think the archetypal realms</a>
01:19:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h19m23s">of human decision-making are something like,
are you working to make things better or are</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h19m29s">Are you possessed by resentment and hatred,

their own psyches, and then there’s a battle</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h19m46s">in culture.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h19m47s">There’s a battle everywhere between those
two fundamental perspectives.</a>

the Great Father, and the Great Father represents</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h20m00s">So there’s the hero and the adversary, at

the Twin Towers have just fallen.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h24m37s">What’s happened?</a>
01:24:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h24m39s">Well, one answer to that is that the towers
fell, but it’s a very, very poor answer.</a>
01:24:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h24m46s">Because that was an unknown unknown, I would
say, and it traumatised people.</a>
01:24:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h24m52s">I mean everyone, even in Toronto, walked around
in shock for about two days after that.</a>
01:24:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h24m56s">And the reason for that was that we didn't
know what fell.</a>
01:24:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h25m00s">The buildings fell, but the thing is the buildings
aren’t isolated.</a>
01:25:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h25m04s">Like, they’re not some abandoned buildings
standing out there in the middle of a field</a>
01:25:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h25m09s">in a barren wasteland in the middle of an

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h25m13s">They weren’t buildings, exactly.</a>
01:25:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h25m15s">They were only buildings at a superficial
level.</a>
01:25:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h25m17s">First of all they had 5000 people in them,
or 5000 people died, if I remember correctly.</a>
01:25:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h25m23s">And then all those people were networked out
with all sorts of other people.</a>
01:25:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h25m28s">And they were networked at multiple levels.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h25m30s">So they were family members but they were
also elements of the financial and economic</a>
01:25:30</p>

01:25:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h25m36s">And in the political </a>
01:25:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h25m40s">And then what was hit was of course, not just
the buildings, but the economic and political</a>
01:25:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h25m46s">system, whatever that means.</a>
01:25:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h25m48s">And of course the people who took the towers
down weren’t trying to knock buildings down,</a>
01:25:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h25m54s">which is what you saw happen, they were trying
to knock down the things the buildings invisibly</a>
01:25:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h25m59s">related to.</a>
01:25:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h26m01s">And then you might ask well, what were those
buildings invisibly related to?</a>
01:26:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h26m04s">And it’s a simpler question to actually
reverse the question and ask, well what weren’t</a>
01:26:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h26m08s">they related to?</a>
01:26:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h26m10s">And the reason that people were traumatised
in the aftermath was because when we, when</a>
01:26:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h26m14s">our bodies, in some sense, answered that question,
the answer was, uh oh, those buildings were</a>
01:26:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h26m21s">probably attached to everything in every possible
way.</a>
01:26:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h26m25s">And so God only knows what’s going to come
leaping out of that.</a>
01:26:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h26m29s">So what happens when you see the buildings
fall, the facts that you see the buildings</a>
01:26:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h26m37s">fall actually blinds you to what’s happening.</a>
01:26:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h26m39s">It’s a very peripheral representation of

01:26:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h26m43s">Because you could also say, well it was a

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h26m48s">of you.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h26m49s">Well, you don’t see that, you feel it, and
you don’t really know what it means.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h26m52s">But it puts a wave of uncertainty, a radical
wave of uncertainty, into everything.</a>
01:26:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h26m58s">And not only the present, but also the future
for sure.</a>
01:26:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h27m01s">Because things took a vicious turn after that,
and almost immediately, right?</a>
01:27:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h27m05s">The whole political system readjusted itself,
it became much more authoritarian.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h27m09s">You know, airports became little fascist enclaves.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h27m16s">It just drove me crazy to be lined up like
that and then subject to search, you know,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h27m23s">by faceless representations of the paranoid

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h27m39s">It was a way worse consequence I think, than
the buildings falling down themselves.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h34m20s">For lots of our ancestors going down to get
water from the local river was a life or death</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h34m26s">I mean I can’t imagine having to get water
from a crocodile infested stream.</a>
01:34:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h34m31s">Especially when that’s where the lions are
hanging out too, you know.</a>
01:34:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h34m35s">So, that’s order.</a>
01:34:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h34m37s">That’s the positive element of order.</a>
01:34:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h34m39s">Now you can say, students say this a lot:
“oh my God, I’m so constrained within</a>
01:34:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h34m43s">these boxes, it’s destroying my individuality”
you know.</a>
01:34:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h34m47s">And that’s the tyrannical…</a>
01:34:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h34m48s">I mean it’s pathetic in some sense, because
God, you’re so privileged it’s beyond</a>
01:34:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h34m54s">comprehension.</a>
01:34:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h34m56s">But having said that, it is also the case,
and the case has to be made, that you do have</a>
01:34:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h35m02s">to sacrifice your potential to cultural norms.</a>
01:35:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h35m06s">And that is… you can argue that that’s
destructive.</a>
01:35:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h35m10s">And sometimes it is destructive.</a>
01:35:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h35m12s">Like creative people don’t fit very well
into nested boxes.</a>
01:35:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h35m15s">And in order for them to fit they have to
do damage in some sense to their psyches,</a>
01:35:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h35m19s">because they’re not naturally made to…
that isn’t their natural environment, boxes</a>
01:35:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h35m28s">within boxes.</a>
01:35:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h35m29s">And so they might say, well I’m being oppressed.</a>
01:35:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h35m31s">It’s like, well of course you’re being
oppressed.</a>
01:35:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h35m34s">If you’re in fifty boxes that’s constrain
your freedom of movement, but maybe you should</a>
01:35:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h35m38s">be somewhat grateful for the fact that the
boxes exist.</a>
01:35:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h35m41s">You think, well you don’t even notice them.</a>
01:35:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h35m43s">The boxes are so effective that you don’t
even notice them.</a>
01:35:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h35m47s">You can even criticise them, and you should,
you know, maybe they could be better and not</a>
01:35:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h35m52s">quite as rigid, and so forth.</a>
01:35:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h35m54s">And the criticism is justified but you have
to keep both of the representations in mind</a>
01:35:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h36m03s">at the same time, you know.</a>
01:36:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h36m05s">Your culture is the wise king and the despot
at the same time.</a>
01:36:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h36m08s">And people hate that sort of thing because…
and you know our rational minds and our history</a>
01:36:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h36m16s">of logical intellectual thinking has forced
us to assume that a thing can’t be itself</a>
01:36:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h36m22s">and its opposite at the same time.</a>
01:36:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h36m24s">But unfortunately when you’re talking about
very large-scale categories, things are what</a>
01:36:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h36m30s">they are and their opposite at the same time.</a>
01:36:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h36m32s">Because culture is the wise king and the tyrant,
and that means it’s very difficult to adjust</a>
01:36:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h36m38s">your behaviour in relationship to it, because
you never know if you’re talking to the</a>
01:36:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h36m42s">wise king or the tyrant.</a>
01:36:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h36m43s">You know, and you feel that.</a>
01:36:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h36m45s">If you have to do your taxes or if you have
to deal with the university bureaucracy in</a>
01:36:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h36m49s">some way, it’s like, you’re a number,
you know, and you’re just annoying, like</a>
01:36:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h36m53s">patients in the hospital, because hospitals
would run a lot better if they didn’t have</a>
01:36:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h36m57s">any patients in them, obviously.</a>
01:36:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h36m58s">And you know, you feel that, of course, whenever
you’re in a very complex bureaucracy.</a>
01:36:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h37m02s">It’s like, you’re exchangeable, and that’s
very annoying.</a>
01:37:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h37m06s">But by the same token, here you are.</a>
01:37:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h37m08s">So you have to criticise… this is also a
very complex form of moral behaviour.</a>
01:37:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h37m13s">You have to criticise with gratitude.</a>
01:37:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h37m16s">And that’s something that students should
really be taught in university, because the</a>
01:37:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h37m22s">opposite of gratitude is resentment, and there
is nothing that’s more pathological than</a>
01:37:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h37m27s">resentment.</a>
01:37:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h37m28s">The only thing that comes close to resentment,
in terms of its capacity to produce misery,</a>
01:37:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h37m33s">is arrogance, and those things are often…
arrogance, resentment, and deceit… it’s</a>
01:37:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h37m38s">like that’s the evil triad.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h37m40s">You get all those three things going in your
life and boy, you’re going to be in rough</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJI0hVV-5Vs#t=01h37m47s">So then, let’s take a break, for fifteen
