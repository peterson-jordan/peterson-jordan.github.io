<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68tFnjkIZ1Q#t=00h21m36s">it's a fundamental metaphor so you can move that around anywhere.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68tFnjkIZ1Q#t=00h22m19s">for example,</a>
