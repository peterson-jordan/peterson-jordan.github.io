<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h00m38s">constructed in England. And-And the myth goes
something like this:</a>
00:00:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h00m41s">There is a-- There is a cup, the Grail, used

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h00m47s">a-- has redemptive significance and it’s

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h00m54s">are after this cup. So, it’s a redemption
story, right?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h00m56s">It means, the world’s damned, unredeemed.
There’s some object that can serve as, as</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h01m08s">symbolic perspective – and it’s worthwhile
to go on a quest of that sort.</a>
00:01:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h01m12s">And the King Arthur story is set up in an
interesting way, ‘cause there’s a king,</a>
00:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h01m16s">Arthur, but he has all these knights, these
nobles, and they all sit at a round table.</a>
00:01:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h01m20s">And they’re at a round table because they’re
equals. So, although it’s a hierarchical</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h01m25s">story, there’s-there’s a motif in it that
transcends the hierarchy.</a>
00:01:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h01m28s">It says: Well… yeah, under normal circumstances
everyone’s arranged in a hierarchy. But</a>
00:01:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h01m35s">when you’re out to seek whatever you need,
then everyone’s an equal. And so, fine,</a>
00:01:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h01m39s">so they sit at the round table, and then they
go off to search for the Holy Grail</a>
00:01:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h01m43s">And the story opens with a very interesting
motif, which is the knights look at the forest</a>
00:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h01m47s">and then they try to find the part that looks
the darkest, to them. And then, they go that</a>
00:01:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h01m53s">way. That’s the marker for their mission,
right, to go to the darkest place. And of</a>
00:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h01m58s">course, each knight goes off in a different
direction because the world looks slightly</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h02m01s">different to each knight.
So… objectively speaking, they’re going</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h02m06s">to a different place. But psychologically
speaking, they are going to the same place,</a>
00:02:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h02m10s">right? And that place, I suppose, is being
represented in mythology and literature as</a>
00:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h02m14s">“The Heart of Darkness”.
And if you were ever curious about why people</a>
00:02:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h02m17s">aren’t enlightened – since it seems to
be a possibility – you can always think</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h02m23s">about the story of King Arthur and the knights
of the Holy Grail, and think: Well, do you</a>
00:02:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h02m27s">really want to enter the forest at the darkest
place? And the answer to that is of course:</a>
00:02:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h02m32s">No, because the darkest place means precisely
that place you least want to go. And it’s</a>
00:02:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h02m37s">the same for everyone
So then, I have this little nephew, although</a>
00:02:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h02m45s">he’s almost 15 now. He had this dream when
he was four years old. And the background</a>
00:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h02m50s">to the dream is this: He was waking up in
the middle of the night for months, screaming.</a>
00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h02m55s">He had night terrors. And this went on for
like six months. And what was happening in</a>
00:02:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h03m01s">his life was twofold: There was some instability
in his family, ‘cause his parents got divorced</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h03m05s">about a year after that. And also, he was
at the transition point from staying at home</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h03m10s">to going to kindergarten.
So, you know, not only was he making the big</a>
00:03:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h03m13s">move out there into the terrible world, but
the stable point from which he might like</a>
00:03:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h03m18s">to have moved was shaky. So, you know, he
wasn’t having that great a time.</a>
00:03:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h03m22s">so anyways he’s screaming away at night,
and this is pretty unsettling, right, ‘cause</a>
00:03:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h03m27s">night terrors are no joke, and so he’s upset
about it, and his mom’s upset about it,</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h03m30s">and so I’m watching him and he’s running
around the house; he’s only about this high,</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h03m33s">a very verbal kid, and he’s got this knight
hat on, and this sword and this shield, and</a>
00:03:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h03m38s">he’s running around the house being a knight,
and at night he takes his night hat and his</a>
00:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h03m43s">shield and his sword to bed,
and I think, we’ll that’s pretty cool,</a>
00:03:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h03m45s">and you can see how that makes sense, right,
and you can see how it’s an enacted reality</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h03m50s">‘cause children enact or act out their reality
before they can explicitly understand it,</a>
00:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h03m56s">just like we do, and so I’m staying there,
he wakes up, and he has, you know, one of</a>
00:03:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h04m02s">these fits, and then the next morning he comes
to breakfast, and I said, hey, did you have</a>
00:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h04m06s">any dreams last night, and he goes, yeah,
I had a dream; I said, well, tell us the dream,</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h04m11s">and there’s six adults sitting around the
table and, you know, we’re ready for this</a>
00:04:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h04m14s">dream, or so we think, and then he says, okay,
I was out in this field and I was surrounded</a>
00:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h04m19s">by beaked dwarfs, and they came up to my knees,
and so these dwarfs they had no arms, they</a>
00:04:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h04m25s">just had shoulders, and powerful legs, and
they had, they were all covered with hair,</a>
00:04:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h04m29s">and they had a cross shaved on the top of
their head, and they were all covered with</a>
00:04:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h04m32s">grease, and everywhere I went these dwarfs
would jump up with their beaks and bite me,</a>
00:04:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h04m37s">and you’re looking at him like, that accounts
for the night terrors, right,</a>
00:04:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h04m42s">and so then he says, yeah, and there’s more
to it too; if, if you look in the background</a>
00:04:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h04m47s">behind all the dwarfs there was a dragon way
in the background and it was puffing out fire</a>
00:04:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h04m52s">and smoke, and every time it puffed out fire
and smoke, a whole bunch more of these dwarfs</a>
00:04:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h04m56s">would get made, and you think, that’s pretty
cool, that’s a hydra story, right, remember</a>
00:04:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h05m01s">the story of the hydra, cut off one head,
two more grows, it’s one of Hercules’</a>
00:05:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h05m06s">trials, and that’s an observation about
the world, which is, you solve one problem,</a>
00:05:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h05m11s">and like two more problems pop up, and then
you solve those and…</a>
00:05:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h05m14s">Anyways, he says, okay, well I’ve got this
dragon back there, and so this is his problem,</a>
00:05:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h05m18s">right, he’s been eaten by beaked dwarfs,
and that’s not good, and there’s not much</a>
00:05:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h05m22s">sense fighting them off because there’s
just more of them made every time this thing</a>
00:05:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h05m26s">lurking in the background breathes, so I said,
what could you do about that</a>
00:05:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h05m30s">it’s like his brain was working all these
ideas around and he’d heard lots of Disney</a>
00:05:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h05m34s">stories and had lots of books read to him,
and had abstracted out a lot of information,</a>
00:05:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h05m39s">but he hadn’t quite got it right, and it
was all seething around in his head, and I</a>
00:05:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h05m42s">just said, well, what could you do, tap, and
he went, oh I know what I could do.</a>
00:05:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h05m47s">I could take my sword and I’d get my dad,
which is a good notion, right, ‘cause he’s</a>
00:05:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h05m52s">small, and then I’d jump up on the dragon
and I’d pop out both of its eyes with the</a>
00:05:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h05m55s">sword so it couldn’t see me, and then I’d
go down its throat to the box where the fire</a>
00:05:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h06m00s">came out, and then I’d carve a piece out
of the box and I’d use that as a shield,</a>
00:06:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h06m05s">and I thought, great, you really got the story,
and the story’s something like this,</a>
00:06:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h06m10s">right: If you’re being plagued by midget

00:06:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h06m23s">went right down the throat of the dragon,
which is, you know, a fairly brave thing to</a>
00:06:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h06m26s">do, and then right to the place where the
fire, the transforming element, was being</a>
00:06:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h06m31s">produced, and he took a piece of the device
that made the transforming element, and he</a>
00:06:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h06m35s">used it as a shield.
Okay. Well that’s really cool, and the story’s</a>
00:06:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h06m40s">better than that, I think, and it’s true

00:06:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h06m45s">sort of stories; this actually happened; he
didn’t have any more nightmares,</a>
00:06:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h06m49s">so when I checked with his mother, repeatedly
after that because I thought, well this is</a>
00:06:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h06m52s">too good to be true, right, he’s got this

00:06:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h06m59s">but that’s the case, it is the case, he

00:06:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h07m02s">and I think that’s because he’d almost
already got it, right; he was running around</a>
00:07:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h07m06s">like a knight; he knew, almost, it just had
to be made a little more explicit, and not</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h07m12s">even that explicit ‘cause it was still a

He couldn’t say that, but he could tell</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h07m29s">the story, and he could act it out, and that
looked like it was good enough, so that’s</a>
00:07:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h07m35s">pretty cool, so he basically, you know, he
managed this, essentially, he fought the dragon</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h07m49s">and that’s a pretty good story because it

means, you know, you’re not gonna run away,</a>
00:08:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h08m06s">and you still have something to learn, then

and you think, well why should I believe that,</a>
00:08:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h08m19s">right, and the answer to that would be, well,
don’t knock it till you try it, and the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h08m23s">second answer would be, that’s exactly what

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h10m33s">of stories like that. And the one that I told

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h11m55s">So then you look at Solzhenitsyn and he says
okay, well so I spent fifteen years trying</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h12m08s">so tough it was unbelievable. You put them

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h20m56s">at least in part as Mary, and she’s handing
out something too, and if you look at those</a>
00:20:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h21m01s">they’re little round circles with crosses
on them, and what those are, are hosts, hosts,</a>
00:21:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h21m07s">they’re the symbols of transformation, particularly
in Catholicism; now that’s a very complicated</a>
00:21:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h21m14s">idea, and this is the idea, it’s something
like this:</a>
00:21:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h21m17s">At Christ’s last supper before he was crucified,
he told his disciples that they were going</a>
00:21:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h21m22s">to have to ingest him, right, so they gave
them wine and bread, and the wine was blood</a>
00:21:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h21m28s">and the bread was flesh, and what’s the
idea, what does it mean to incorporate someone?</a>
00:21:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h21m34s">It means to embody them, that’s what it
means, and this, this imagistic ritualistic</a>
00:21:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h21m40s">process, is the notion that in order to attain
redemption, it’s necessary to embody the</a>
00:21:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h21m46s">hero, and that’s kind of what this picture
is trying to portray,</a>
00:21:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h21m49s">it says, okay, well you got this death apple
over on the left-hand side, and that’s not</a>
00:21:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h21m54s">so good, and you need an antidote to it, and
the antidote is whatever this represents,</a>
00:21:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h21m59s">whatever this represents, and you see up in
the tree here there’s all these hosts hanging.</a>
00:21:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h22m04s">Now the hosts are representative of Christ,
and for complicated reasons they’re made</a>
00:22:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h22m08s">out of wheat, say, and partly the reason they’re
made out of wheat is because if you look at</a>
00:22:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h22m12s">hero Gods prior to Christianity, you see that
wheat was often conceptualized as a dying</a>
00:22:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h22m19s">and redeemed God, right, because it would
die in the Winter and then be re-born in the</a>
00:22:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h22m23s">Spring, just like all plants are, and the
notion of the dying and redeeming, the dying</a>
00:22:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h22m29s">and resurrecting hero, was kind of, what would
you say, layered on top of that older agrarian</a>
00:22:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h22m36s">idea, and all mixed together, and it sort
of popped out in this idea of the, of the</a>
00:22:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h22m39s">host,
and so the idea here is that whatever ails</a>
00:22:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h22m43s">human beings, which is their knowledge of
vulnerability and death, can be rectified</a>
00:22:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h22m49s">by their incorporation of whatever this symbol
represents,</a>
00:22:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h22m54s">and so then you might ask, well what exactly
does that symbol represent, and, of course,</a>
00:22:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h22m58s">the standard Christian answers to that, and
the extended Christian answers are, well it</a>
00:22:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h23m04s">represents your faith in Christ, say, but
that’s not a very useful answer, all things</a>
00:23:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h23m09s">considered, so let’s look at it in a little
bit more complicated way.</a>
00:23:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h23m13s">It’s not a useful answer I think because
it’s too sectarian, right, it excludes many,</a>
00:23:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h23m20s">many people, this notion, and there’s a
whole formalism that you have to buy into</a>
00:23:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h23m24s">to even get access to what that story means,
and it’s an unfortunate formalism because</a>
00:23:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h23m29s">first of all I think it’s more appropriate
to an earlier time and place, and second of</a>
00:23:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h23m33s">all because I think we’re actually sophisticated
enough now intellectually, psychologically,</a>
00:23:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h23m40s">to actually start to understand what some
of these stories mean,</a>
00:23:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h23m43s">and since we have reasonably well-developed
brains, and we might as well use them, it</a>
00:23:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h23m47s">would be better if they were on our side,
so to speak, than constantly conspiring to</a>
00:23:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h23m51s">undermine our faith,
let's look at what a person is like. And a</a>
00:23:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h24m01s">person is sort of just as complicated as a,
an object, which is not that surprising cause</a>
00:24:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h24m06s">there's an aspect of us that is object like,
right? Our objective being.</a>
00:24:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h24m11s">And we know people are unbelievably complicated.
They have they have nervous systems that have</a>
00:24:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h24m18s">more connections in them than there are subatomic
particles in the universe, just for starters.</a>
00:24:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h24m23s">And so that means that when you're looking
at another person, you're looking at something</a>
00:24:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h24m27s">that's more complicated than anything else
that exists anywhere, including the sum total</a>
00:24:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h24m32s">of everything that exists everywhere, except
other people. More complex than everything.</a>
00:24:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h24m38s">And then you have to understand too that just
because you don't think of yourself that way</a>
00:24:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h24m42s">doesn’t mean you're not that way.
It just means that you're conscious mind,</a>
00:24:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h24m46s">your rational mind say isn't sophisticated
enough to actually completely model who or</a>
00:24:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h24m53s">what you are. And that's obvious because that's
why we study ourselves. We don't know who</a>
00:24:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h24m58s">we are. We're trying to figure it out. We've
been trying to figure it out ever since we</a>
00:24:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h25m00s">woke some thousands of years ago. We don't
know when</a>
00:25:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h25m06s">And you think well if you look at people,
well you know, there's the kind of obvious</a>
00:25:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h25m09s">level that you see people at, the self level,
which is the privileged level of analysis</a>
00:25:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h25m14s">for the west. But you’re a member of a family.
And if I said well are you more yourself or</a>
00:25:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h25m19s">your family, you might say well, most of the
time I think I'm more myself, but I might</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h25m24s">be willing to sacrifice my life for my child's.
In which case I would say well, then you’re</a>
00:25:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h25m30s">just as much your child as you are you. Or
maybe you’re even more your child. And what</a>
00:25:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h25m34s">about your family? Well that's a tough question
too. And then what about your cultural group?</a>
00:25:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h25m39s">Well you say no, it's me, not my cultural
group. But then I'd say well what if there's</a>
00:25:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h25m43s">a war? Is it you or your cultural group? And
then you’ll say oh it's my cultural group.</a>
00:25:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h25m48s">And then you see as well, well at this level
of analysis are you your biological group?</a>
00:25:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h25m56s">Is that what you identify with, the biosphere
say? Say well no, not generally. But there's</a>
00:25:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h26m01s">a lot of environmentalists out there. And
they say well what we should primarily be</a>
00:26:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h26m06s">concerned with is the global health of the
planet because our survival depends on that.</a>
00:26:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h26m11s">We're as much that as we are the self. And
you might not agree with that. And I suspect</a>
00:26:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h26m15s">that most of the time there's screwy reasons
for proposing such a thing. But on the other</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h26m20s">hand, a case can be made.
I mean we know that you can undermine your</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h26m25s">ecosystems. It happened in Spain. They let,
four hundred years ago they let the sheep</a>
00:26:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h26m29s">eat everything. And so Spain turned into a
desert. Doesn't seem like a particularly wise</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFu9nNPMiUk#t=00h26m33s">move.
And then you think well below the phenomenological</a>

it's perfectly reasonable to presuppose that</a>
