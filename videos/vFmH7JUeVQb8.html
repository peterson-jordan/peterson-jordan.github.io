00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h00m03s">Please clap for Matt Delahante.</a>
00:00:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h00m22s">Thank you very much</a>
00:00:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h00m27s">I clearly know some of the people present</a>
00:00:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h00m30s">Thank you so much for coming here</a>
00:00:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h00m33s">And many thanks to Bangburn Philosophy for organizing this event and many great events</a>
00:00:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h00m38s">And the ones that I have participated in, some of them will probably be shown on the screen, so you can see what is going on</a>
00:00:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h00m43s">For those who do not know, I died Delahunt 13 years ago</a>
00:00:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h00m47s">When I hosted the TV show "The Atheist Experience" in Texas</a>
00:00:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h00m50s">In addition to lessons, debates and other things</a>
00:00:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h00m53s">We've also been working with magic since I was three years old</a>
00:00:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h00m56s">I did some lessons in magic and irony</a>
00:00:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h00m59s">Where I was doing magic and I knew about skepticism</a>
00:00:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h01m01s">And we had traveled across Canada, and that was amazing</a>
00:01:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h01m04s">We went to Victoria, Vancouver, Winnipeg, Calgary and Ottawa</a>
00:01:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h01m09s">So here we are tonight, but I'm not doing magic or talking about skepticism</a>
00:01:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h01m13s">This is because something exciting has been raised</a>
00:01:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h01m16s">A few months ago I was at the Chan Center in Vancouver</a>
00:01:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h01m20s">With both Tracy Harris and Sarah Heder</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h01m22s">And we were talking in one of the rooms, and I looked into the dressing room next to my dressing room</a>
00:01:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h01m27s">And it was written there "Jordan Peterson."</a>
00:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h01m29s">It wasn't completely familiar to me, but people were already sending me information</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h01m34s">They say "you gotta talk to Jordan Peterson" "you gotta do it"</a>
00:01:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h01m37s">And even though our rooms were next to each other, we never had a chance to speak</a>
00:01:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h01m41s">And I've finished the event with Tracy and Sarah and I'm back home</a>
00:01:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h01m45s">Then Travis called me and said, "When will we do your witchcraft and suspiciousness?"</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h01m49s">Would you like to do Toronto events instead of stand up and do an improvisation?</a>
00:01:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h01m54s">Just sit down and chat with Jordan.</a>
00:01:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h01m56s">And I said "definitely"</a>
00:01:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h01m58s">And I will tell you in advance, since I will not waste your time and want to reach the topic for which you came</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h02m05s">We'll sit here and chat, we met for the first time in two hours for dinner</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h02m11s">So that would be a kind of acquaintance</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h02m13s">There will be something we agree on and another on which we disagree, who knows</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h02m17s">And we're going to take some questions, there's microphones at the end of the hall</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h02m20s">Two quick notes, one thing has been announced</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h02m22s">Some of you may be familiar with it</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h02m24s">I will not answer any questions about American atheists and David Silverman</a>
00:02:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h02m28s">And this is the best thing we do as it has nothing to do with this event at all</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h02m32s">The other thing I had told Jordan was over dinner</a>
00:02:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h02m36s">The video that I got the most, was the BBC interview</a>
00:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h02m41s">When the person meeting him used to repeat the phrase "so what you say is"</a>
00:02:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h02m46s">Even if I disagree with him about everything (which is not true)</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h02m51s">Even if I hate him, I hate it even more</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h02m56s">So I will not repeat the sentence "so what you say is"</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h02m58s">In case I had a question, I would say, "Does that mean?"</a>
00:02:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h03m02s">Things that lead to clarification instead of using the "straw man" approach when you have an agenda</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h03m08s">So thank you so much everyone for coming tonight</a>
00:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h03m11s">We will try to have an entertaining conversation</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h03m20s">And without further delay, ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Jordan Peterson</a>
00:03:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h03m42s">They were so noisy that I was almost shoved into the chair</a>
00:03:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h03m47s">How are you doing?</a>
00:03:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h03m49s">Ready to start</a>
00:03:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h03m53s">There are people who came and it was said this and that and we had a little talk over dinner</a>
00:03:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h04m00s">I think it is nice to start with something quick, easy and simple, like God</a>
00:04:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h04m08s">And specifically, I do not believe in the existence of God</a>
00:04:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h04m13s">And I do not have knowledge of your thoughts on this topic</a>
00:04:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h04m16s">Do you mean that you do not believe in his existence?</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h04m19s">I don't mean on the topic in general</a>
00:04:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h04m21s">But I would be glad to hear your thoughts on what I probably don't think</a>
00:04:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h04m36s">Well, it's a complicated problem</a>
00:04:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h04m38s">And I don't think we take it as seriously as it deserves</a>
00:04:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h04m43s">I specifically don't think the kinds of famous atheists, for whom I respect</a>
00:04:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h04m50s">They take it seriously</a>
00:04:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h04m53s">So I don't think they take it seriously enough from a biological perspective</a>
00:04:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h04m59s">Or from the perspective of phenomenology</a>
00:04:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h05m01s">Or from a literary or metaphorical perspective</a>
00:05:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h05m05s">That would be useful for beginners</a>
00:05:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h05m08s">I have become convinced that the basis of the main assumptions of our Western cultures</a>
00:05:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h05m19s">They are statically intertwined and in a metaphorical substrate</a>
00:05:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h05m26s">When you enter that metaphorical pillar, you become under the control of religious phenomena</a>
00:05:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h05m31s">And I think you will not only be able to draw that conclusion as a consequence of a deep philosophical idea and literary analysis</a>
00:05:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h05m40s">But if you know enough about the functioning of the mind, you will also reach the same conclusion</a>
00:05:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h05m46s">I think you will also come to the same conclusion if you look at the development of religious science</a>
00:05:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h05m53s">From the perspective of a developmental biologist, not from the position of the biological developers who have added a belief</a>
00:05:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h06m00s">That most human morality was created in the first 500 years since the Enlightenment</a>
00:06:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h06m06s">So I think that's the beginning</a>
00:06:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h06m10s">You have to bear with me because I'm from Texas</a>
00:06:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h06m16s">It's okay, I'm from Alberta and it's older than Texas, it's that bad</a>
00:06:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h06m26s">So the curious thing to me is that seems to apply to religious thought and religious customs</a>
00:06:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h06m37s">And the value of religious identity for people</a>
00:06:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h06m41s">I do not see that any of this is related to the possibility of a god or not or the existence of sufficient reason to believe in his existence</a>
00:06:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h06m50s">And this is the point I stick to, I have no problem with the idea</a>
00:06:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h06m53s">Okay, we're trying to do it without a loud applause, but it's good that I got it</a>
00:06:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h07m00s">Never complain about the warm applause</a>
00:07:00</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h15m04s">You can stop smoking without the intervention of something supernatural</a>
00:15:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h15m08s">No, not really</a>
00:15:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h15m09s">Can't you stop smoking without supernatural intervention?</a>
00:15:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h15m11s">There are no reliable chemical methods to induce smoking cessation</a>
00:15:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h15m14s">You can use a drug called bupropine I think</a>
00:15:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h15m21s">Is this supernatural?</a>
00:15:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h15m23s">No, you don't need a supernatural effect, but it doesn't work well</a>
00:15:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h15m26s">But if you give people magic mushrooms and they have a mysterious experience</a>
00:15:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h15m31s">With one treatment, they would have an 85 percent chance to quit smoking</a>
00:15:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h15m35s">But that's kind of evidence</a>
00:15:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h15m37s">It is proof that you can take the mushrooms and increase your chances of quitting smoking</a>
00:15:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h15m43s">No, not like that, it is an indication that if you took the mushroom and had a mysterious experience</a>
00:15:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h15m49s">You will stop smoking because it does not work</a>
00:15:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h15m52s">Well, if you eat mushrooms and have had an experience that you describe as mysterious, you will increase your chances of quitting smoking</a>
00:15:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h15m59s">This does not indicate to me that they had a supernatural experience</a>
00:15:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h16m06s">Well it is not conclusive evidence it is never evidence</a>
00:16:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h16m09s">No, of course it is proof, wait one second, this is an error, it is really a guide</a>
00:16:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h16m17s">He's right, I'll correct that</a>
00:16:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h16m21s">Well if you want to think about it suspiciously</a>
00:16:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h16m24s">You have a drugstore that is mushroom medicine, which I gave to people trying to quit smoking</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h16m30s">This mushroom medicine does not have a direct effect on smoking behavior</a>

00:16:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h16m38s">And you can get physiological indications of that mysterious experiment</a>
00:16:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h16m42s">You might say that isn't enough to prove it to be a mysterious experience</a>
00:16:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h16m46s">You are conscious and I accept it, you accept all kinds of things</a>
00:16:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h16m50s">Without the ability to apply its validity to every possible formula</a>
00:16:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h16m58s">So don't be in a hurry, it's a serious matter</a>
00:16:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h17m01s">If people were given mushrooms and they had a mysterious experience</a>
00:17:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h17m06s">They will not just quit smoking</a>
00:17:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h17m10s">But they also wouldn't suffer from the fear of dying if they had cancer</a>
00:17:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h17m14s">And this is important, and not only that</a>
00:17:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h17m16s">If I tested them after a year and they had a mysterious experience</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h17m24s">Including marriage, their personalities will be permanently modified to more openness and more innovation</a>
00:17:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h17m34s">By standard speculation, this is a massive effect</a>
00:17:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h17m40s">So we cannot be in a hurry to do without this</a>
00:17:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h17m44s">So paranoia, as I have mentioned repeatedly, is not an understatement or a falsehood</a>
00:17:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h17m49s">And I am not saying that there is nothing supernatural and that nothing is a mysterious experience</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h17m56s">What people describe as self "I had a mysterious moving experience"</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h18m13s">All of this is self-explanatory, which may be due to linguistic limitations</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h18m21s">And which they have no other, this is the language that represents all culture</a>
00:18:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h18m25s">We have to use it for explanation</a>
00:18:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h18m27s">But that does not in any way serve to confirm the theory of the existence of a supernatural kingdom or supernatural agent</a>
00:18:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h18m36s">It depends on your definition of the supernatural, I understand your intent</a>
00:18:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h18m40s">I do not claim that the phenomenon of ecstasy due to the breaking of the fast is a direct proof of God's existence</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h18m49s">Although that would be great</a>
00:18:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h18m53s">People narrate personal experiences of this kind of thing, but that is not completely outside of the realm of experience</a>
00:18:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h19m00s">But because of the boundaries that exist between objective and subjective</a>
00:19:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h19m06s">It's hard to go deep enough to come up with what is definitive</a>
00:19:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h19m11s">And I understand that's a problem</a>
00:19:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h19m14s">But the question of the supernatural is a different matter</a>
00:19:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h19m19s">People are able to enter different trial sessions</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h19m23s">Where things are different for them in quality</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h19m25s">Their impressions are different, their thoughts are different, their responses to the world are different</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h19m30s">They feel diving with their own death</a>
00:19:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h19m33s">And they exceeded their normal level of impression</a>
00:19:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h19m38s">Perhaps this is not part of what is supernatural</a>
00:19:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h19m41s">But you started by defining the supernatural somewhat narrowly</a>
00:19:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h19m44s">Are you asking for a miracle here and now?</a>
00:19:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h19m47s">Something that defies the laws of physics?</a>
00:19:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h19m49s">What is your definition of the supernatural?</a>
00:19:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h19m51s">So there is a natural world, and there are people who claim that something is not part of the outside world</a>
00:19:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h19m59s">And that this thing has an external and supernatural origin</a>
00:19:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h20m03s">These are the claims that I do not see the possibility of making a confirmatory epistemology</a>
00:20:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h20m10s">I have no problem accepting that people have these experiences</a>
00:20:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h20m14s">For many years I have been a southern fundamentalist intent</a>
00:20:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h20m19s">And I remember standing in the church, feeling what I was describing at the time as the holy ghost</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h20m27s">Now, after many years, I remember it and ask myself why I was describing it this way</a>
00:20:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h20m33s">It is a unique experience of the same quality as drug experimentation or similar</a>
00:20:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h20m40s">I tried similar things, from music to drugs to sex</a>
00:20:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h20m44s">But they are not completely the same</a>
00:20:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h20m46s">This is the type of reservation that believers use</a>
00:20:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h20m50s">"What you are talking about in terms of sexual pleasure or drugs is not the same as my feeling in the Holy Spirit, I have felt them all."</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h20m56s">The reason at that time led me to say that I was filled with the Holy Spirit</a>
00:20:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h21m01s">Is that everyone around me was saying that</a>
00:21:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h21m04s">Not because I had any way to apply the causal connection between the Holy Spirit and my experience</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h21m12s">I had an experience and I, like everyone else around me, ascribed it to the Holy Spirit</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h21m18s">How was your experience?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h21m19s">Euphoria and pleasure, I don't think I had any aspirations</a>
00:21:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h21m26s">It was definitely an overwhelming emotion, you get chills</a>
00:21:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h21m33s">I clearly remember the first time I had a very similar experience outside of church</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h22m02s">Because a southern religious official has different styles than a fiftieth religious official</a>

00:22:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h22m27s">The same way as the elevator experience, where everyone turns with their faces to the back of the elevator</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h22m34s">Then the latter often feels uncomfortable and turns with his face towards the back side like everyone else</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h23m03s">Which can be evoked through music, dance, and other forms of ritual and multitude</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h23m15s">To attribute that to a supernatural source</a>
00:23:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h23m19s">Well I want to separate that from another line of thinking, let's leave that aside</a>
00:23:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h23m23s">What we can think of is a theory on the origin of religious belief</a>
00:23:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h23m27s">Experience comes first, and with it comes implicit assumptions about the supernatural</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h23m34s">Who awakens those experiences behind the scenes</a>
00:23:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h23m37s">Well, this is very different from theories of religious deduction</a>
00:23:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h23m42s">For example, Freud's theory of religion being a defense against fear of death</a>
00:23:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h23m47s">Or Marx's theory of religion being the opium of the people</a>
00:23:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h23m50s">The theory we are putting before us is a more biological one</a>
00:23:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h23m55s">And it seems to me a more reliable theory</a>
00:23:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h23m57s">Even though religious movements may be harnessed for economic purposes</a>
00:23:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h24m01s">And for purposes of manipulation, this is clear</a>
00:24:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h24m05s">I can say that there are a number of explanations that I have heard about the origin of religion</a>
00:24:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h24m09s">And I find them all reasonable explanations in different forms</a>
00:24:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h24m12s">Except for those that claim to have come from supernatural formations</a>
00:24:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h24m15s">Well that and what we will follow</a>
00:24:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h24m18s">That was more funny than I expected, I'm just honest</a>
00:24:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h24m23s">Honestly, this is a lot of times more funny than people think</a>
00:24:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h24m27s">Well people can have these experiences and they can be evoked in many ways</a>
00:24:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h24m32s">And people find these experiences valuable, at least through their self-narration</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h24m57s">So here is a question</a>
00:24:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h24m58s">Why do people go through these experiences and have a tendency to attribute them to supernatural sources as a spiritual source</a>
00:24:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h25m07s">What is happening now</a>
00:25:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h25m10s">Optimal belief, and this is a contradiction</a>
00:25:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h25m13s">The skepticism is not saying, "Let's get this out and talk about it."</a>
00:25:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h25m18s">If we want to come up with acceptable explanations is possible</a>
00:25:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h25m20s">For me it is very similar to the 1940's and 1950's</a>
00:25:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h25m24s">When people were kidnapped by aliens or were fleeing to them</a>
00:25:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h25m28s">They had various explanations about the aliens</a>
00:25:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h25m32s">These explanations often matched the monsters I saw in films after 2001</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h25m37s">Or sorry, after the film "Close Contact with the Third Kind"</a>
00:25:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h25m41s">Almost all alien photography has become a big head</a>
00:25:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h25m46s">The narratives in the culture of what an alien is upon him were close</a>
00:25:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h25m51s">And people would say, "This is what I went through."</a>
00:25:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h25m54s">Likewise, cameras sometimes capture a certain movement or light effect in a house that is said to be haunted</a>
00:25:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h26m04s">This is then interpreted as a ghost or spirit in human form</a>
00:26:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h26m09s">In some cases, we can clarify that this is not true</a>
00:26:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h26m13s">In other cases, we don't necessarily have an idea of ​​what they have seen</a>
00:26:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h26m15s">But because of what people understand about sects, spirits, and ghosts</a>
00:26:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h26m22s">It is implicit in the way we think</a>
00:26:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h26m26s">Our perception enters as an acceptable explanation, even if there is no such thing</a>
00:26:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h26m34s">This is why they converge, but it does not explain why the main motivation is attributing the matter to the supernatural</a>
00:26:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h26m44s">I am not convinced that natural instinct applies to the supernatural</a>
00:26:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h26m51s">I think the thing is we're not just formula markers</a>
00:26:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h26m56s">But we are a race of people, do you know how to see faces?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h27m00s">Yes, that's good, right</a>
00:27:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h27m02s">So you see faces and expect that there is something hidden to get you</a>
00:27:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h27m06s">Then you go and check and see that there is nothing to get at you</a>
00:27:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h27m10s">Instead of guessing that you might be wrong and saying, "Maybe it's spirit."</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h27m39s">And between being lying there and not there</a>
00:27:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h27m42s">It seems natural to have the conclusion that something of me is gone</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h27m49s">This does not mean that something of me like spirit is gone</a>
00:27:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h27m54s">When the radio or television stops working, we do not think that the man on television is gone, that the television is just not working</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h28m08s">I don't know if you should use that comparison</a>
00:28:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h28m11s">Because it suggests that whatever is on the TV is coming from an external source</a>
00:28:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h28m14s">You definitely won't work this equation with respect to spirit</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h28m21s">Yes, that's exactly the point</a>
00:28:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h28m23s">You are stating that consciousness is not present in the mind even if it is centered</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h28m29s">Why then do I think consciousness is somewhere other than mine?</a>
00:28:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h28m31s">How do you calculate awareness?</a>
00:28:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h28m33s">I'm not sure we can calculate consciousness</a>
00:28:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h28m35s">This is definitely true</a>
00:28:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h28m37s">But I have no reason to think that it is beyond what the mind can produce</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h28m47s">Consciousness is not only mysterious, it is very vague, the most mysterious thing, not only is it normally mysterious</a>
00:28:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h28m58s">The fact that something is really is so mysterious that I or have no explanation for it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h29m05s">If there is such a thing, we say it is consciousness, do we not have a full explanation of consciousness?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h29m11s">Not even partial, it seems to be associated with the mind in an unclear way</a>
00:29:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h29m15s">So consciousness is really vague, and you and I do not have an explanation for it</a>
00:29:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h29m19s">We as humans are not comfortable saying "I don't know," and that's something I'm trying to teach people to be more comfortable with.</a>
00:29:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h29m25s">That is to say, "I don't know."</a>
00:29:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h29m27s">So when you ask me about consciousness, I reply, "I don't know."</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h29m31s">But other people never feel comfortable saying "I don't know."</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h29m35s">They stop him with an explanation that cannot be justified, something that cannot be tested or falsified</a>
00:29:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h29m40s">Which is that there is a ghost in the machine</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h30m03s">Because I worry that by confirming the explanation, you stop looking for real action</a>
00:30:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h30m08s">So you say that part of the reason we assume a beings is, is that there is a deficiency in a being in death</a>
00:30:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h30m17s">This is related to the question of why people attribute their mysterious experiences to supernatural beings</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h30m33s">And that they have a hyperactive agent detector</a>
00:30:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h30m36s">So it's a collection of all the mechanics that produce this</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h30m40s">Which allows them to attribute supernatural characters to the source of mysterious experiences, something like that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h30m58s">This is what it seems to me, there are a lot of ways to think about how people interact with the world</a>
00:30:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h31m05s">But I think that's the way we treat ourselves and people as we see them behave in the world</a>
00:31:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h31m12s">So I think it is an indication of our deepest belief, because I believe faith is linked to action</a>
00:31:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h31m17s">So what consciousness looks like to me is a force that confronts possibility</a>
00:31:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h31m25s">Sometimes we call it a possibility, sometimes we call it a possibility, and sometimes we call it the future</a>
00:31:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h31m35s">I don’t see then that we are absolutely walking like clockwork, which I think</a>
00:31:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h31m40s">Although I've been accused of misunderstanding Sam Harris before</a>
00:31:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h31m43s">But I think that's the equation he's doing</a>
00:31:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h31m47s">Instead, I see us as elements facing a ground of possibility</a>
00:31:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h31m52s">And what consciousness does is enable us to turn that potential into reality</a>
00:31:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h31m59s">And we do it with anything that allows us to make decisions</a>
00:31:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h32m02s">I think our legal system is actually based on the idea that it is true</a>
00:32:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h32m08s">I think if you treat yourself that way, it will work</a>
00:32:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h32m13s">I think if you treat others that these are their basic characteristics and perhaps their values, you will agree with them</a>
00:32:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h32m20s">And I think if you organize your community on these assumptions, it will seem effective</a>
00:32:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h32m25s">So what do you think about the idea of ​​consciousness facing a floor of possibility or possibility?</a>
00:32:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h32m34s">I don't think I had a problem with anything specific that I said</a>
00:32:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h32m41s">There are many different ways of framing these things so that people can better understand them</a>
00:32:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h32m46s">One of those things that people suffer from, and perhaps we will have to return to that later, there is no need to go into it far</a>
00:32:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h32m53s">This idea that the absence of God means the absence of moral authority worries many</a>
00:32:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h33m02s">And when you talk about looking at consciousness ...</a>
00:33:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h33m07s">The way you describe consciousness is what our agency has been called</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h33m18s">I get along too much with Dan Dennett</a>
00:33:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h33m22s">But I had another discussion recently, and I'll explain because of that discussion</a>
00:33:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h33m26s">I have no problem that we have a desire and a will and that we are an object capable of seeing himself</a>
00:33:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h33m35s">To see what the consequences of my actions will be in the future</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h33m38s">It does not matter to me if it is absolutely as extreme as it is now</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h33m45s">Or if it was something like a Trump imperative</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h33m48s">I'm so sorry I didn't have to say Trump</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h33m53s">If there is anything that can get rid of the inevitable picture</a>
00:33:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h33m59s">This does not change for me the fact that you will be responsible for your actions</a>
00:33:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h34m07s">Let's say when my lawnmower is in trouble, I cut it</a>
00:34:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h34m15s">Yes, it is difficult to get rid of these remnants of religious behavior</a>
00:34:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h34m19s">Yes it's true, I mean at least I got rid of them</a>
00:34:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h34m27s">I haven't seen you dealing with your lawn mower yet</a>
00:34:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h34m31s">But in the end, I came to understand that the lawnmower is not a thinker who does not make decisions</a>
00:34:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h34m36s">So the difference is that I am introducing a kind of idea that implies more moral responsibility</a>
00:34:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h34m43s">I had an argument with Sam Harrison in Chicago about free will</a>
00:34:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h34m48s">And I was indicating that he could walk and get off the stage</a>
00:34:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h34m54s">Or I could pick it up and take it off stage, and the effect would be the same</a>
00:34:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h35m00s">But the conflict between the two situations is everything I describe as will</a>
00:35:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h35m04s">Whether you call it free or not, that's what we value and we care about</a>
00:35:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h35m10s">I would have taken responsibility for the action and would have acted against what the other element wanted</a>
00:35:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h35m18s">And there would be a theoretical error in that</a>
00:35:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h35m21s">Yes, well, that's fine</a>
00:35:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h35m23s">We can go to the topic of ethics, I think the next question I have, unless you have something to pursue</a>
00:35:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h35m30s">Is that a lot of .. You were saying that a while ago, and it seems that you talk about it a lot</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h35m35s">You have not dealt with the issue yet .. I will not return to it because I want to move forward</a>
00:35:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h35m40s">The question of whether or not there is a good reason to believe that God exists as opposed to the question of whether or not there is a good reason for people to believe that God exists</a>
00:35:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h35m51s">There are people who believe and there are people who believe in belief and the existence of value</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h35m56s">And from what you said here and in some other comments, which I will not argue with you</a>
00:35:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h36m01s">I am curious, regardless of whether God exists</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h36m05s">What do you fear that we will lose if people stop believing in the existence of God or believing in the existence of value?</a>
00:36:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h36m16s">We will lose the metaphorical foundation of our soul and be lost</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h36m23s">I really want to know, and I'm not playing the villain, I want to know what you mean by the metaphoric pillar.</a>
00:36:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h36m34s">Because you say we will lose it, when I ask you and you say we will lose it there are two things</a>
00:36:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h36m40s">The first thing is there are things that you and I both agree that you should preserve</a>
00:36:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h36m45s">And other things, you and I may disagree on the necessity of preserving them</a>
00:36:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h36m50s">Because when people tell me, if I walk on the Dosteyevsky road, God does not exist and that everything is permitted</a>
00:36:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h36m57s">First of all, I do not think that is true ..</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h37m03s">Aside from literally seeming arrogant as it sounds, I could torpedo that with a two-minute lesson on the ethics of secularism.</a>
00:37:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h37m11s">I think the first part of that argument is correct, but not the second part</a>
00:37:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h37m16s">We can look into that</a>
00:37:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h37m18s">But there are two categories of things that you and others may fear losing</a>
00:37:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h37m24s">Some of them I can agree that we don't have to lose them</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h37m28s">Others, I will have no problem losing it</a>
00:37:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h37m31s">Also, it is wrong to throw Sam Harris off the stage</a>
00:37:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h37m33s">Yes, I am not planning to do that but it crossed my mind for a moment</a>
00:37:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h37m39s">We both agree that often was wrong</a>
00:37:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h37m43s">Often yes</a>
00:37:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h37m45s">I follow the status quo as an assistant, if the theater was on fire would have been the best thing I could do for him throwing Sam out of it</a>
00:37:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h37m56s">So what do you think we're going to lose, what bothers you, when you say the metaphor?</a>
00:37:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h38m02s">I might be literally ignorant, but I really don't understand what it means</a>
00:38:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h38m08s">There are degrees of an idea, I mean that the structure of every idea or belief is multi-level, like a piece of music</a>
00:38:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h38m17s">There is the word in the sentence, then the sentence itself, then the phrase, and then the paragraph</a>
00:38:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h38m25s">Then a series of paragraphs within which paragraphs are written</a>
00:38:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h38m31s">Then the context is broader than the explanation for all of that</a>
00:38:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h38m35s">Then comes our emotional or motivational likeness, and then our embodiment in the world</a>
00:38:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h38m42s">And all of these things are active as we understand each other</a>
00:38:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h38m47s">And when we move outside the scope of language, which is the degree of the paragraph, say</a>
00:38:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h38m53s">Toward the emotional, motivational, and embodiment, we also move to the figurative</a>
00:38:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h38m59s">The metaphor is structured in a certain way and this is well documented, by the way</a>
00:38:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h39m05s">If you look at how the two hemispheres of the brain interact</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h39m09s">You'll see the left half (Let's talk broadly and I'm not oversimplifying you, but we don't have time), it's linguistic.</a>
00:39:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h39m17s">But correctly understood linguistic speech is provided by the right half, which is not verbal</a>
00:39:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h39m23s">Which includes things like language music</a>
00:39:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h39m25s">So at the bottom of the linguistic structure there is something extra linguistic that takes the form of metaphors and fictional and drama, that kind of thing.</a>
00:39:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h39m36s">The religious ground is made up of stories, metaphors, and dramas</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h39m42s">And if you disable it, it will bisect the widest possible context within which the statements are made in an understandable manner</a>
00:39:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h39m51s">Well I followed it all, shockingly</a>
00:39:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h39m56s">Anytime you talk about the two hemispheres and all of that ..</a>
00:39:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h40m00s">So when you talk about the larger context</a>
00:40:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h40m04s">If we lose faith in God, we lose the metaphorical pillar that is the broader context in which we evaluate narratives.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h42m46s">And your answer to that is that I believe because I have a moral sense</a>

00:43:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h43m04s">You see Sam Harris as an implicit value actor</a>
00:43:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h43m08s">Would you otherwise have thrown him off the stage</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h43m11s">Then the question is exactly as a question of why is it an intrinsically valuable entity, what is your metaphysics for that</a>
00:43:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h43m17s">I don't think it has value implicitly, in the sense that the universe suggests that there is something clear</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h43m31s">Morality to me is much simpler than some think</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h43m38s">Maybe you are the one who reads the mind</a>

00:43:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h43m42s">Because for me, even though I've been sitting here talking about this for decades, I don't believe in God</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h43m49s">You said that I believe because I have a moral code, but a moral code that I talked about ..</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h44m02s">Instead, you ask why Sam has an implicit value, so it seems in your stories that this is the only explanation</a>
00:44:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h44m09s">Perhaps you were afraid of being punished</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h45m03s">okay then</a>
00:45:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h45m07s">Because if we turned to ribeye here we might go downhill</a>

00:47:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h47m47s">Sure, let's hear it, man</a>
00:47:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h47m49s">If I cut my head off it would be counter to my health</a>
00:47:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h47m53s">I did not intend to say that, I would say that it is a metaphoric pillar</a>
00:47:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h48m00s">You say I have to accept that</a>
00:48:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h48m02s">No, I never tell you what to accept</a>
00:48:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h48m05s">You certainly do, you say your death would be a mistake</a>
00:48:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h48m07s">I'm just trying to explain my position</a>
00:48:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h48m09s">But you said that this will not correspond to your well-being, and this is a metaphysical and philosophical saying, and it is not a clear truth.</a>
00:48:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h48m19s">Cutting someone's head is against his health!</a>
00:48:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h48m21s">It depends on your definition of wellness</a>
00:48:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h48m24s">Of course</a>
00:48:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h48m25s">But that matters</a>
00:48:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h48m27s">If you define wellness as this glass of water we are not discussing the same</a>
00:48:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h48m30s">You can define wellness, it's okay, that's what I'm waiting for</a>
00:48:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h48m33s">You cannot, you cannot define wellness</a>
00:48:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h48m37s">So why should I try, I definitely won't be able if you keep telling me I can't</a>
00:48:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h48m40s">Well pardon, I'll hold back, all ears!</a>
00:48:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h48m47s">So the initial objection to Sam and I’s position is always repeated</a>
00:48:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h48m52s">That is why anyone should be interested in the topic of wellness</a>
00:48:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h48m55s">And we will both admit that this is actually a self-preference. There are people who will care about wellness and people who will not.</a>
00:48:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h49m02s">The second objection is that wellness is not clearly defined</a>
00:49:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h49m06s">We both admit it, we are not saying we have all the answers on how to achieve a better life</a>
00:49:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h49m12s">We're saying we'll know wellness, and I'm saying you can start with some foundations</a>
00:49:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h49m21s">It could start with death being preferable to life, but you don't go too far in this direction</a>
00:49:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h49m25s">Stop suffering</a>
00:49:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h49m27s">No, I'm saying you can start out that death is preferable to life but you don't go too far in this direction</a>
00:49:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h49m33s">Yes, you go away, you stop suffering, you just die</a>
00:49:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h49m38s">If you cannot start with the substrate</a>
00:49:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h49m40s">When you die you are not a being so there is no wellness</a>
00:49:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h49m51s">This is not necessary</a>
00:49:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h49m54s">If you look at the best things in our life you cannot say that death is better</a>
00:49:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h50m00s">Yes you can</a>
00:50:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h50m01s">I know you can say it</a>
00:50:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h50m03s">People always do that</a>
00:50:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h50m05s">They can express their preferences, but their preferences may be wrong</a>
00:50:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h50m09s">How can being dead good for your life?</a>
00:50:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h50m13s">What if you are a victim of chronic burn and have cancer?</a>
00:50:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h50m19s">I never have a problem with the notion that there are situations in which death may be preferable to someone's life</a>
00:50:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h50m28s">But when we talk about broader areas, like talking about creating the best possible society or the best possible quality of life for people</a>
00:50:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h50m37s">Death is not included in this, which does not mean that there are no individual exceptions</a>
00:50:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h50m42s">So the foundations on which I started, it can begin to be that death is better than life and so forth</a>
00:50:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h50m46s">If you start out that life is generally preferable to death</a>
00:50:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h50m49s">And health in general is preferable to disease</a>
00:50:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h50m51s">Happiness is generally preferable to sadness</a>
00:50:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h50m53s">None of these are bound by strict rules</a>
00:50:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h50m57s">So if you start out with them, then you are not skeptical about those claims</a>
00:50:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h51m01s">Well I ask!</a>
00:51:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h51m04s">You are out here and say I will never be the straw man around you</a>
00:51:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h51m08s">Now, every time I say something, you respond by saying, "You're not a skeptic about that."</a>
00:51:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h51m13s">I am sorry, I am not trying to attack you, I am trying to understand where your equation begins</a>
00:51:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h51m19s">It seems weird that you are saying "You're not a skeptic about that" when I'm in the middle of my rubbish tour</a>
00:51:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h51m24s">While I'm in the middle of the sentence explaining that those are the general foundations to start with</a>
00:51:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h51m30s">Well that is what I was asking about, if you say, and correct me if I am wrong then I am not trying to be difficult</a>
00:51:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h51m37s">You say those are the positions you start from, those are the things that you accept according to faith</a>
00:51:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h51m43s">No</a>
00:51:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h51m44s">You have justification for them</a>
00:51:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h51m46s">Yeah</a>
00:51:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h51m47s">Let's hear it</a>
00:51:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h51m48s">You have already heard them! Life in general is preferable to death because we are talking about our life and death is not among the concerns of our living</a>
00:51:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h51m57s">There can be no exception. That is the point I would have come to</a>
00:51:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h52m01s">So you can start with those points, or start with any three that you find</a>
00:52:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h52m05s">You can choose three random bases</a>
00:52:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h52m07s">And the aspect that makes the secular moral system distinct from religious judgments and the theory of spiritual leadership and that kind of thing</a>
00:52:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h52m15s">Is that the secular moral system has its goal of continuous improvement</a>
00:52:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h52m23s">This means that if you discover that one of your foundations is wrong, or contradicts with something else, you can change it</a>
00:52:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h52m30s">You can start out that death is preferable to life, and then when you discover that this is not working well, you can change it</a>
00:52:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h52m34s">I think those foundations are based on the relevant evidence of how people live their lives and what they care about</a>
00:52:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h52m40s">It may be better than my tri-group and I am open to reviewing any of the foundations at any time</a>
00:52:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h52m46s">But to say that I am not skeptical about them, this is completely the opposite of who I am</a>
00:52:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h52m52s">Because skepticism is that I will not accept something as true without a good reason</a>
00:52:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h52m58s">Which is to be willing to review if there is evidence</a>
00:52:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h53m02s">If you and I agree that we care about the good life, and the good life is not properly defined</a>
00:53:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h53m08s">We may have different ideas of what the good life means, we can just sit here and take notes</a>
00:53:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h53m14s">I think we'll look at maybe the five things we agree that contribute to the good life</a>
00:53:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h53m20s">If we take these things and compare them to the foundations of a secular moral system that I am explaining</a>
00:53:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h53m26s">We can determine, non-subjectively, if the list we have created can be accessed through those foundations</a>
00:53:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h53m35s">We can do this for religious morality, too</a>
00:53:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h53m37s">The analogy I used in the past, for example, is chess</a>
00:53:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h53m43s">There is nothing in the universe that requires us to care about the game of chess and its laws are random and were invented by someone</a>
00:53:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h53m50s">We're changing those laws, we've added traffic lights and fortification traffic, and we've done things like this</a>
00:53:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h53m54s">We have the laws of chess and we don't always know which moves are the best</a>
00:53:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h53m57s">But if the goal of the game is to win or not to lose, we can analyze the moves in line with the consequences and the goal of winning.</a>
00:53:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h54m08s">Then determine which moves are the best and which are the worst moves</a>
00:54:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h54m11s">This is what the secular moral system does because it allows review while religious systems do not</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h54m56s">This is not exactly the point, but rather the point is that it has been updated</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=00h57m43s">I didn't say it that way</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h03m19s">Yes true, it is a broader phenomenon</a>
01:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h03m23s">I just see people use religion that way</a>
01:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h03m25s">So what are we going to do to wrap up, I heard you say we have to answer the questions</a>
01:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h03m29s">We'll take a few questions</a>
01:03:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h03m33s">I didn't mean to grab that, I was just curious about the timing</a>
01:03:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h03m39s">You can easily say that, I was happy to talk for five hours</a>
01:03:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h03m44s">But they calculate it, and all of these people have better questions than I will come up with</a>
01:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h03m49s">So there are microphones above, yes where is that guy</a>
01:03:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h03m53s">Oh my God it is lit and we can see it</a>
01:03:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h03m55s">Some notes on the questions, and by the way thanks. That was great and we will talk tomorrow</a>
01:03:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h04m09s">Here I start to have some fun</a>
01:04:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h04m13s">Some notes on the questions, some of you know I am doing a live TV show where I interrupt people</a>
01:04:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h04m17s">And if you think that I will not interrupt you, you are wrong</a>
01:04:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h04m20s">But I hope I don't have to and that everyone is in line with the questions and the question marks</a>
01:04:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h04m28s">And the kind of questions we're looking for are the ones that don't begin with propositions or with someone's life story</a>
01:04:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h04m33s">So you can mention your name if you want, and if you do not want it okay, then say your question to both of us</a>
01:04:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h04m40s">And I'll make a promise that I'm taking a break every time, but I'm not going to take it tonight and I'm going to do my best to give shorter answers so we can hear everyone who has questions.</a>
01:04:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h04m51s">They enlightened you first, sir. Thank you and give you a moment</a>
01:04:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h04m56s">Thanks, I think this question is most likely to Jordan Peterson</a>
01:04:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h05m01s">Just to clarify more clearly what you mean by God, do you think that in the event of the demise of humanity, God will still exist?</a>
01:05:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h05m21s">I don't think I know how to answer that</a>
01:05:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h05m24s">The whole situation is hypothetical, I mean, I can address some of it</a>
01:05:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h05m37s">Human beings are characterized by awareness and self-awareness, which is relatively unique</a>
01:05:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h05m46s">There is some less clear evidence of self-awareness in animals, but it is not conclusive</a>
01:05:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h05m53s">Some of them can recognize themselves in the mirror</a>
01:05:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h05m56s">But our self-awareness is accompanied by expressive linguistic and graphic models of ourselves</a>
01:05:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h06m03s">And that has been clarified in a large time scale</a>
01:06:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h06m06s">There are a lot of formation factors that will be gone if we are gone</a>
01:06:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h06m11s">And it is not clear how true this is, because I do not understand to what degree formation depends on consciousness</a>
01:06:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h06m23s">He also sees the classical materialistic Enlightenment, which I might say in the nineteenth century</a>
01:06:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h06m28s">That if consciousness is nullified, the material substrate of this universe will remain unchanged</a>
01:06:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h06m37s">But I do not take that equation because I believe that the material substrate ..</a>
01:06:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h06m43s">I think that reality is a strange thing .. I think that reality is the interaction of what we consider to be the material substrate and consciousness itself</a>
01:06:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h06m54s">And so when you destroy consciousness, you are shattering reality</a>
01:06:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h06m58s">And I don't really understand what that leaves a trace</a>
01:06:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h07m00s">Because it has neither relativism nor any measure in the clear sense, without any introduction to the existence of an invisible censor</a>
01:07:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h07m09s">So a lot disappears without awareness and self-awareness</a>
01:07:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h07m14s">I do not know how to answer the question whether God will disappear</a>
01:07:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h07m17s">Because that brings us back to the same problem that I was talking about earlier</a>
01:07:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h07m21s">Which is that it is not quite easy to understand what people mean when they say "God"</a>
01:07:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h07m26s">Because when you asked the question "Will God disappear" there is speculation that the essence of God can be understood and placed in a small place</a>
01:07:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h07m34s">As with anything as simple as a chair, for example, that we both share the same concept</a>
01:07:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h07m39s">There are an endless number of caveats in the religious literature about guessing that you understand the meaning of the term</a>
01:07:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h07m49s">Or sometimes even about using the term</a>
01:07:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h07m51s">So this is the best thing I can do with that question</a>
01:07:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h07m55s">Thanks</a>
01:07:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h08m02s">Hi, My question is about something Matt said but I would like Dr. Peterson to answer it first</a>
01:08:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h08m11s">So Matt, you said people don't want to seek to develop their own moral system</a>
01:08:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h08m17s">And thus they turn to religion to free them from the duty of that idea</a>
01:08:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h08m21s">But is it not reasonable to see religion as an archival system that holds the truth</a>
01:08:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h08m29s">If we abandon that, are we not in a position where everyone has to invent their own morals in their lives, as a newborn child he has to achieve it again</a>
01:08:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h08m42s">In practical terms, this seems like an impossible system to put in place with any result</a>
01:08:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h08m50s">I just wonder how to solve that dilemma</a>
01:08:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h08m52s">This was Nietzsche's criticism</a>
01:08:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h08m54s">I am not trying to put in place an order, the system has already been established</a>
01:08:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h08m59s">So my goal is not to rid the world of debt, but that would be a good side effect of my goals</a>
01:08:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h09m07s">My goal is to achieve the best possible understanding for me of reality, and for other people to achieve it as well</a>
01:09:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h09m16s">When I talk about religion, there are things within religious history, within religious teachings that are correct, good, and useful</a>
01:09:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h09m28s">We have no reason to believe that any of this will pass if it stops us from believing in God</a>
01:09:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h09m34s">Because they are true, good, and true things, whether God exists or not</a>
01:09:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h09m38s">If the thing we're worried about is ... I've asked people before</a>
01:09:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h09m42s">I apologize if this bothered anyone, but there are people who say:</a>
01:09:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h09m46s">"If you do not believe in God, what prevents you from rape and murder?"</a>
01:09:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h09m50s">And I say if you were persuaded today that your belief in God does not exist and you were forced for some reason to leave Him</a>
01:09:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h09m58s">Are you going to start killing?</a>
01:09:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h10m00s">There are people who will say yes, and I optimistically do not believe them, but we know that there are people who do</a>
01:10:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h10m11s">But the truth of what is good and beneficial is true regardless of whether or not a debt persists</a>
01:10:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h10m18s">Because children are not born with an understanding of morality, but rather they learn it and become educated about it from their parents and explore the world.</a>
01:10:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h10m28s">In fact, everyone goes through the process of creating an understanding of their own ethics</a>
01:10:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h10m35s">We are only constructing things from what is around us that show us evidence that they are smarter and better, we are sitting on the shoulders of the giant.</a>
01:10:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h10m45s">The burning question I am asking is for Christians who believe in the existence of God and Satan</a>
01:10:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h10m53s">It is as follows: "How did you decide that God is good and Satan is evil?"</a>
01:10:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h10m59s">Because the paradigm is that God has written His moral law in your heart and this is what you say</a>
01:10:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h11m04s">But if that was the case, if Satan had written his moral code in your heart, you would say that it is good</a>
01:11:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h11m12s">The truth is that you use your internal self-evaluation to determine that God is good or that this religion is correct</a>
01:11:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h11m21s">Or that the first baptismal church is the correct one or the second baptismal church is the correct, or this is the preacher who should be employed</a>
01:11:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h11m27s">This is what we do, and I don't see much value in worrying about the possibility of everything disappearing</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h12m05s">It is because of this benefit itself that people are afraid of what will happen given what they have seen in the past</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h22m32s">I say that a primary religious language, there is such a thing, and I try to separate it in "Maps of Meaning"</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h23m07s">Whereas in the scientific realm, the real or sensual aspect is essentially something like this</a>
01:23:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h23m17s">So the question from the religious perspective is something like this:</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h23m20s">What is the best way to interpret the world if we wish to determine how to act well within it?</a>
01:23:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h23m29s">And the way in which that language develops is the result of a transformative process in biological and cultural terms</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h23m52s">So this is the mystery surrounding us all, and that will be related to talking about it with the future potential and the potential within you.</a>
01:23:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h24m00s">It is the sublime part of the formation that continues to escape from your theorizing, that is the unknown</a>
01:24:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h24m07s">It is just like the undiscovered regions for animals, it is an important part of the formation</a>
01:24:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h24m12s">So the undiscovered area is unknown, and there are areas that have been discovered, the culture is the known thing</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h24m19s">This room and these cultural norms that unite us enough to sit here and be peaceful when we debate is tough.</a>
01:24:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h24m29s">So that's the religious ground, these are yin and yang, and these are chaos and order</a>
01:24:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h24m34s">Interestingly, our minds seem to have adapted to that particular ground</a>
01:24:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h24m38s">Because the right hemisphere appears to be most responsible for the chaos operations of the anonymous</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h24m44s">While the left hemisphere appears to be responsible for the operations of the familiar and the familiar</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h24m49s">And that is a good proof, if you do not want to take my word for it you can read the book "Lynn McGail Crest" called "The Master in His Emery"</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h24m56s">It is a pioneering treatment in the neuropsychological aspect</a>
01:24:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h24m59s">So that's the religious domain, yin and yang, chaos and arrangement</a>
01:24:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h25m04s">And this puts humans in the center</a>
01:25:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h25m08s">The idea is that we are always confronted with what we understand, and we have to understand that</a>
01:25:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h25m14s">Even in these authoritarian statements</a>
01:25:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h25m18s">We are always confronted with the ultimate truth of what is incomprehensible and which may appear in our life at any moment and hinder it.</a>
01:25:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h25m26s">that's the truth! Then comes the religious question:</a>
01:25:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h25m30s">"If that is the truth, how do you orient yourself in your relationship with these two domains?"</a>
01:25:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h25m36s">And the answer to that is, for example, following the instinct of the meaning, because the meaning appears like the instinctive answer</a>
01:25:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h25m47s">Embedded in a neuropsychological image in the directive reflection, I might say a primary reflection of the unknown</a>
01:25:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h25m52s">Meaning is the response that directs us in that world</a>
01:25:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h25m57s">So when we engage in a meaningful interest it is a signal from the farthest point in our biology</a>
01:25:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h26m02s">However, we have a balance between what we know and make us feel safe and what we do not know and should be explored</a>
01:26:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h26m10s">This makes us safe, not inclusive, engaged, not panicked</a>
01:26:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h26m21s">And by staying at that middle point of the scale that we mentioned earlier</a>
01:26:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h26m26s">So by staying at that point we are doing what is best for us and the best for our families and our community, and only God knows what is beyond that.</a>
01:26:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h26m37s">We do it all simultaneously, and we can say that we do, that it speaks to us when we do it</a>
01:26:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h26m46s">And that is the point that goes beyond religious instinct, it is the ability to go along the boundary between chaos and order</a>
01:26:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h26m56s">Which is represented by mythical heroes such as Saint George who goes out to slay the dragon</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h27m08s">There is nothing outside of religious language that raises that greatness, there is nothing there to suggest to non-normal people</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h27m47s">Yes sir</a>
01:27:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h27m49s">Thank you for this interesting and fact-finding conversation</a>
01:27:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h27m54s">My question is for you, Dr. Peterson</a>
01:27:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h27m56s">I implied that there is a difference between someone who is actually an atheist and someone who claims to be an atheist</a>
01:27:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h28m06s">I mentioned it when I said he "died" and some of the others are not true atheists</a>
01:28:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h28m12s">I'm curious to know why you think so?</a>
01:28:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h28m15s">Is this just because everyone of us has confidential values?</a>
01:28:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h28m19s">How to be a true atheist in your opinion?</a>
01:28:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h28m24s">Raskolnikov is in the book Crime and Punishment</a>
01:28:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h28m28s">And I really cannot come up with a better answer for that, because it is a complex question and this is the correct answer</a>
01:28:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h28m35s">I love that book, it's an amazing book with a lot of suspense, by the way, out there maybe a lot of you haven't read it</a>
01:28:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h28m43s">You have to read it because it might be the best novel ever written</a>
01:28:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h28m47s">It's incredibly exciting when you start reading it</a>
01:28:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h28m50s">Raskolnikov hatches a perfect murder plot. It's so exciting</a>
01:28:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h28m55s">The last thing Dosteyevsky did was turn his rivals into straw men</a>
01:28:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h29m02s">What Dostyevsky has done in all of his great novels is to make all his enemies or all the situations with which he competes</a>
01:29:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h29m11s">She looks as strong and impressive as possible, and he was able to do that since he was an amazing genius.</a>
01:29:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h29m19s">So "Raskolnikov" weaves a murder plot, and assassinates the terrible woman, which is considered terrible for everyone who knows her</a>
01:29:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h29m27s">And who has enslaved her mentally frail little sister, the woman who does nothing but make people miserable all the time.</a>
01:29:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h29m37s">And he's doing what he's doing to save his sister from an advanced form of prostitution</a>
01:29:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h29m42s">To save himself from hunger so that he can become a lawyer and help people</a>
01:29:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h29m48s">So Dosteyevsky is setting the stage. Here is an ideal situation for assassination, where all rational options point in that direction</a>
01:29:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h29m57s">And "Raskolnikov" kind of tortures himself or is tortured because he is hungry, unwell and does not think clearly.</a>
01:29:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h30m06s">He chooses the assassination and goes far to carry it out, and before that he rebukes himself</a>
01:30:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h30m15s">This is what I might call the negative atheist type</a>
01:30:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h30m17s">He says: See there are all the rational reasons for dividing this woman's skull with an ax</a>
01:30:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h30m28s">I look at all the good things I will achieve, I look at the wellness that I will improve in others</a>
01:30:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h30m34s">So he does it! Then all the gates of Hell open!</a>
01:30:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h30m38s">Raskolnikov made his way to assassination by setting the rational case</a>
01:30:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h30m47s">And also by saying that God does not exist and there is no metaphysical reason that deters me from this act</a>
01:30:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h30m55s">And there are all these reasons that push me in that direction</a>
01:30:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h30m59s">Maybe I'm only a moral coward to be afraid of doing, so he does it</a>
01:30:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h31m06s">But what he finds is that he has broken an unbreakable moral rule, something is happening to his inner soul.</a>
01:31:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h31m13s">The rest of the book deals with a series of post-traumatic dissociation</a>
01:31:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h31m20s">The issue of post-traumatic stress is very interesting</a>
01:31:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h31m24s">One of the things you see is a constant occurrence in PTSD</a>
01:31:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h31m28s">It often happens in people who watch themselves do something very sly</a>
01:31:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h31m35s">And that is, they admit, I don't build that in them</a>
01:31:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h31m38s">They saw themselves doing this and accidentally breaking the old moral code</a>
01:31:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h31m44s">And they shaped themselves in a way that they couldn't fix, they were broken forever</a>
01:31:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h31m53s">So there are acts like this, crime and punishment first and often I might say</a>
01:31:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h32m00s">She does a great job of explaining, anecdotally, how these self-evident or intuitive things intersect into this broad anecdotal metaphorical substrate.</a>
01:32:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h32m13s">And that you are using your rationality to deviate from that metaphorical substrate at your own risk</a>
01:32:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h32m18s">And I think that's the point, it's a precise collection of myself</a>
01:32:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h32m25s">Thanks, I'd like to know if Matt has any thoughts about that</a>
01:32:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h32m29s">Do you think?</a>
01:32:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h32m36s">It is surprising, and I assure you that I do not mean to insult because I put you in a high position among the excuses that I dealt with</a>
01:32:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h32m48s">There is a common theme among the justifications, which is the saying "You are not really an atheist, because ..."</a>
01:32:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h32m59s">Now in the case of Dr. Peterson, "You are not really an atheist, because in my mind an atheist is a murderer."</a>
01:32:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h33m07s">"And I will not bother you with that. You think that you are an atheist, but you really are not."</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h33m16s">Some other justifiers say, "You think you are an atheist, but you are not, because God has written His moral law on your heart."</a>
01:33:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h33m26s">This is basically what has been expressed in some way</a>
01:33:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h33m31s">And that is that there is an ethical pillar and a moral center that God places in people</a>
01:33:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h33m36s">And that we all know that and distinguish it and that you are not really an atheist, and this is what an atheist does ..</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h33m41s">An atheist is someone who does not believe in the existence of God, I am not convinced of the existence of God</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h33m46s">This does not necessarily mean that I am completely convinced that God does not exist</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h33m58s">This, as I have talked before, is independent of whether or not I am educating myself or doing good things</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h34m20s">There are atheists in the crowd who wrote to me, “We can't wait for the conversation to take place with Jordan</a>
01:34:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h34m27s">And I said that was fine, and I hope we will have a lot of conversations in the future as well</a>
01:34:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h34m33s">Just to say about something I find upsetting won't be enough to get rid of me</a>
01:34:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h34m39s">He is not familiar to me, I asked, what about him? What do you like and worry about?</a>
01:34:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h34m47s">And they answered a bunch of things, none of them did anything about compatibility of religious views</a>
01:34:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h34m56s">They seemed to be confused about it</a>
01:34:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h34m58s">The good news for them was that while he thinks atheists are killers, he thinks you are not an atheist</a>
01:34:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h35m07s">This is his way of circumventing and acknowledging things that conflict with his worldview</a>
01:35:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h35m15s">I wouldn’t have decided who a true Christian was, I didn’t even do it while I was a believer, and I certainly won't now</a>
01:35:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h35m22s">Something he says to represent he is a Christian, I have to accept that, I have an example in my mind of what that means and what it means to be a Muslim</a>
01:35:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h35m31s">But I want them to explain their model to me</a>
01:35:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h35m34s">I know people who are described as Christian atheists, who really like what Jesus said, but they don't believe in God.</a>
01:35:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h35m40s">There is Thomas Jefferson who wrote the Jefferson Gospel, and from him he removed everything that was traced back to the supernatural and miracles.</a>
01:35:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h35m47s">This is because he liked the teachings there</a>
01:35:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h35m50s">I think you can be a culturally Christian if you want to</a>
01:35:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h35m54s">It's interesting to me, I'm not sitting here with someone like Ray Comfort</a>
01:35:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h36m01s">Where I am told, "You are not an atheist because you are better than being an atheist."</a>
01:36:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h36m09s">This is what atheists always face because they have been marginalized by religious privileges all over the world for many years</a>
01:36:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h36m17s">And when atheists tell their family members or friends and the tas they have known for many years that they are atheists, they are told</a>
01:36:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h36m21s">"Are you an atheist, how is that? You are a good person, I've known you for a long time"</a>
01:36:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h36m25s">And this is because the prevailing idea among people of what an atheist is, has been poisoned through religious statements, our reputation has been distorted from the pulpits</a>
01:36:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h36m36s">And this has been infused into all aspects of culture directly to the point of intellectual pursuit</a>
01:36:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h36m43s">And it is time for that to end</a>
01:36:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h36m53s">I didn't like to tell you, but you are going to give us the last question</a>
01:36:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h36m58s">There are a lot of questions that I can put forward</a>
01:36:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h37m00s">Sorry, they warn me</a>
01:37:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h37m03s">Would you like to talk more about consciousness or morality?</a>
01:37:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h37m09s">Dude, it's your question!</a>
01:37:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h37m12s">Well, moral?</a>
01:37:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h37m16s">Yes, because that will be fast, not as in the state of consciousness, which will never be faster</a>
01:37:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h37m21s">Thank you Matt for returning to Toronto. It's always great to hear you</a>
01:37:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h37m26s">Thank you for coming, Dr. Peterson</a>
01:37:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h37m28s">Dr. Peterson, you seem very eager to talk about evolution and biological underpinnings</a>
01:37:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h37m38s">And that would influence the great stories that exist that underpin our lives</a>
01:37:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h37m43s">But can't evolution be a pillar of morality without that extra step?</a>
01:37:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h37m49s">Isn't it enough that the only animals that evolve are only those that don't die?</a>
01:37:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h37m55s">And the only one that developed in a society or lived in a civilized community</a>
01:37:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h38m01s">Is it not strange that there are evolutionary underpinnings for morality, and that there are animals that demonstrate morality and not just humans</a>
01:38:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h38m12s">We are really good at it but we are not the only ones</a>
01:38:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h38m15s">Well, I definitely say the last part of your argument is correct, you can see morality is a contingent property of collective interaction in some sense.</a>
01:38:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h38m29s">It is more complex than that, it is group interactions through time, it is more complex</a>
01:38:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h38m34s">You can clearly see the moral underpinnings in animals, for sure</a>
01:38:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h38m39s">You ask, "Should there be something more metaphysical than that?"</a>
01:38:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h38m44s">No, I'm saying it seems to us metaphysically because we are wrong analysts for the real world as every shade in the grass Type 1 False Positive - Negative False</a>
01:38:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h38m56s">But why not be a society if we are naturally incapable of being immoral?</a>
01:38:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h39m05s">Moral to me is completely selfish, it feels good for me to be moral because things are good that way</a>
01:39:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h39m09s">And it makes me feel so good to be nice to others, if I felt that I should be nice I wouldn't</a>
01:39:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h39m15s">So when we're moral there is a reason why we feel so good!</a>
01:39:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h39m20s">Well, I'll go back to Young again, he made an assumption and talked a lot about the image of God in human beings, which was instinctive of God.</a>
01:39:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h39m35s">And let's return to the issue of anesthesia</a>
01:39:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h39m40s">You could say that people can have an intense mysterious experience, even those mysterious experiences of a deity, let's say</a>
01:39:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h39m51s">Because that really happens, without taking it as evidence of the existence of divinity</a>
01:39:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h39m56s">Religious instinct is built so deeply within us that we are unable to get out of it even if it is only a physical instinct</a>
01:39:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h40m05s">That's the possibility</a>
01:40:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h40m07s">Some of us can get out</a>
01:40:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h40m08s">Let him continue because our time is up</a>
01:40:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h40m10s">I don't even know how to distinguish between these things, I'm not even sure you can distinguish between them</a>
01:40:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h40m22s">Do I have anything to say about that in closing</a>
01:40:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h40m27s">I think no, I tried to put those perspectives out</a>
01:40:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h40m31s">The detailed answer to your question is found in my book, and it spans nearly 600 pages</a>
01:40:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h40m37s">And it's really, really, really, really difficult</a>
01:40:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h40m41s">But it really does handle what you are asking, and I really don't think there is a simpler way of explaining, I couldn't find a simpler way</a>
01:40:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h40m51s">I have a few things before we close</a>
01:40:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h40m53s">First of all, I have no idea what size my first book will be, but it will not be 600 pages. This does not mean that there is something wrong with that</a>
01:40:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h41m02s">Also, I don't think I have anything specific to connect with your question because I have the impression that we are on a similar path</a>
01:41:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h41m13s">Because I think that is the cultural-ethical aspect, and it happens naturally</a>
01:41:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h41m19s">We observe the true meanings and justice of others</a>
01:41:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h41m23s">And the cornerstone of morality from my point of view, as I had drawn up a blueprint for the ethical system</a>
01:41:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h41m28s">The foundations for this are empathy and the desire to live the good life</a>
01:41:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h41m33s">The last note is, once upon a time while I was under the influence of LSD</a>
01:41:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h41m40s">I was staring at the plank of the bathroom door, not knowing why I was in the bathroom, but I was there</a>
01:41:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h41m49s">And from the wooden plank of the bathroom door a picture is formed, this is not a joke</a>
01:41:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h41m54s">A strawberry had an S letter on her chest, a face and a robe</a>
01:41:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h42m05s">And the huge strawberry (Super Strawberry) flew out of the bathroom door and circled around my head before hitting the door and becoming again a plank.</a>
01:42:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h42m16s">It's the most beautiful trip ever</a>
01:42:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h42m20s">However, I do not think it refers to the reality and capabilities of the huge strawberry</a>
01:42:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h42m33s">And because that wasn't a fair greeting to end the session, I'll let Dr. Peterson give one final note, then we'll tell you good night.</a>
01:42:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h42m45s">So if you have something to add and close with on any topic we discussed tonight</a>
01:42:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h42m51s">I only have one thing and that is that I am pleased with what it means, that these kinds of discussions are happening and that there is an audience of the public who is watching</a>
01:42:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h43m06s">that is great</a>
01:43:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h43m10s">And in full agreement with that remark, thank you for your presence. We appreciate your devotion. I will be glad to see you come again.</a>
01:43:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmH7JUeVQb8#t=01h43m20s">Thanks</a>
