people say things like "everyone's creative".</a>
00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h00m04s">It's like - that's wrong, okay? It's wrong.</a>
00:00:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h00m06s">It's just as wrong as saying, that everyone's extroverted.</a>
00:00:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h00m09s">First of all, you have to be pretty damn smart to be creative.</a>
00:00:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h00m11s">Because otherwise, you're just gonna get to where other people have already got - and that's not creative by definition, so...</a>
00:00:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h00m18s">So, being fast and being out there,
at the front of things, really makes a difference.</a>
00:00:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h00m22s">And then, you also have to have these divergent thinking capabilities.</a>
00:00:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h00m25s">And that's part of your trait structure.</a>
00:00:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h00m27s">And creative people are really different than non-creative people.</a>
00:00:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h00m30s">You know, partly because, for example:</a>
00:00:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h00m32s">they're highly motivated to do creative things,
and to experience novelty,</a>
00:00:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h00m36s">(and to... x3) chase down aesthetic experiences, and to attend movies,</a>
00:00:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h00m41s">and to read fiction, and to go to museums,</a>
00:00:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h00m43s">and to enjoy poetry, and to enjoy music
that's not conventional music, for example.</a>
00:00:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h00m48s">These aren't trivial differences.</a>
00:00:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h00m50s">And so, it's a real misstatement to make
the proposition, that everyone's creative.</a>
00:00:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h00m56s">It's just simply not the case,
it's a matter of wishful thinking.</a>
00:00:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h01m00s">It's like saying, that everyone is intelligent.</a>
00:01:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h01m01s">It's like, well, if everyone is intelligent,
then the term loses all of its meaning.</a>
00:01:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h01m06s">Because any term, that you can apply to every member of a category, has absolutely no meaning.</a>
00:01:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h01m10s">Now, that doesn't-</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h01m12s">And you know, the other thing you wanna be thinking about here, is that - don't be thinking, that creativity is such a good thing.</a>
00:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h01m17s">It's a high-risk/high-return strategy.</a>
00:01:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h01m20s">So if you're creative... you just try this!
There's creative people in this room, man.</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h01m23s">You guys are going to have a hell of a time monetizing your creativity.</a>
00:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h01m26s">It's virtually impossible.
It's really, really difficult.</a>
00:01:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h01m29s">Because, first of all, let's say
you make an original product.</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h01m32s">You think the world will be the pathway to your door, if you build a better mousetrap.</a>
00:01:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h01m35s">It's like, that's complete rubbish.
It isn't- it isn't true in the least.</a>
00:01:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h01m40s">If you make a good, creative product,
you've probably solved about 5% of your problem.</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h01m46s">Because then you have marketing,
which is insanely difficult.</a>
00:01:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h01m48s">And then you have sales,
and then you have customer support,</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h01m51s">And then, you have to build an organization, and you have to...</a>
00:01:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h01m54s">If it's really novel, you have to tell people,
what the hell the thing is!</a>
00:01:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h01m58s">You know, we built this Future Authoring program, right?
[stutter] It's available for people online.</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h02m03s">How do you market that?</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h02m04s">No one knows what that is,
and that's a real problem.</a>
00:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h02m07s">If you wrote a book - well, then you have the problem,
that another million people have also written a book.</a>
00:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h02m11s">But if you produce something, that's
completely new and doesn't have a category,</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h02m15s">people can't search for it online.
How are they gonna find it?</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h02m18s">So you, you just have-
And then you have pricing problems, and...</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h02m21s">It's really, unbelievably difficult to produce
something creative, and then monetize it.</a>
00:02:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h02m26s">And even worse, if you're the creative person:
let's say you have a spectacular invention.</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h02m30s">You've got no money, right?
You've got no customers.</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h02m33s">Those are big problems. And so, maybe
you go and you find a venture capitalist.</a>
00:02:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h02m37s">We start with family and friends,
cause that's how it works.</a>
00:02:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h02m39s">You raise money for your product - you raise money from your family and friends.</a>
00:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h02m42s">That's assuming, you have family and friends that have some money, and that they're going to give it to you.</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h02m47s">And most people aren't in that situation.
So it's a terrible barrier right off the bat!</a>
00:02:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h02m51s">And then of course, you're putting your family and friends at substantial financial risk,</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h02m55s">because the probability, that your stupid idea is gonna make money, is virtually zero.</a>
00:02:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h02m59s">Even if it's a really brilliant idea!</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h03m01s">And so then, let's say: well, you get past family and friends, and you get venture capitalists involved.</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h03m06s">Cause that's often the next step.</a>
00:03:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h03m08s">Or an angel investor, that's-
There's steps in building a business.</a>
00:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h03m12s">Family and friends, angel investor - that's some rich guy, that you've happened to meet some manner- in some way;</a>
00:03:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h03m17s">who's into this sort of thing, and is willing to provide you with some money, to get your product off the ground.</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h03m23s">Well, how much of your product [profit] is that person gonna take?</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h03m27s">Well, most of it! Most of it.
And then, if you get a venture-</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h03m31s">And no wonder, because, you know...
You don't have any money.</a>
00:03:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h03m34s">How are you gonna bargain for control over your product?</a>
00:03:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h03m37s">He'll just say: "Well, do you want the money or not?"</a>
00:03:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h03m39s">And if your answer is "no", then... he'll go and
do something else with his money. It's not like...</a>
00:03:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h03m44s">There's no shortage of things,
that you can do with your money.</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h03m47s">There's million things you can do with it!
So, you're not in a great bargaining position.</a>
00:03:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h03m51s">And then, if you get venture capitalists involved,
they'll take another big chunk.</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h03m54s">And maybe, if they're not very straight with you,
they'll just throw you out!</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h03m58s">Because maybe, by that point in the company's development, you're nothing but a pain in the neck.</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h04m02s">Because what do you know about:
marketing, and sales, and customer service,</a>
00:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h04m05s">and building an organization, and running a business?</a>
00:04:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h04m08s">Like, you don't have a clue.
So why do they need you?</a>
00:04:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h04m11s">So, even if you're successful at generating a new idea,
and you put it into a business,</a>
00:04:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h04m16s">the probability that you, as the originator of the- of the idea,</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h04m20s">are going to make some money
from it - is very, very low!</a>
00:04:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h04m23s">So don't be thinking, that creativity is such a...
Something you would want to curse yourself with.</a>
00:04:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h04m29s">Now, you know, it's not all bad, because it opens up
avenues of experience for creative people,</a>
00:04:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h04m34s">that aren't available to people who aren't creative.</a>
00:04:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h04m36s">But it definitely is a high-risk/high-return strategy, you know?</a>
00:04:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h04m40s">So, the overwhelming probability is that you will fail.</a>
00:04:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h04m44s">But a small proportion of creative people succeed spectacularly.</a>
00:04:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h04m49s">And so, it's like a lottery in some sense.</a>
00:04:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h04m51s">You're probably gonna lose.
But if you don't lose, you could win big.</a>
00:04:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h04m55s">And that keeps a lot of creative people going.
But also, they don't really have much choice in it!</a>
00:04:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h04m58s">Because if you're a creative person,
you're like a fruit tree, that's- that's bearing fruit.</a>
00:04:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h05m04s">So, you don't really have-
You can suppress it, but it's very bad for you.</a>
00:05:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h05m08s">You know, the creative people I've worked with,
is if they're not creative, they're miserable.</a>
00:05:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h05m11s">So they have to do it, but...</a>
00:05:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h05m14s">And you know, there's real joy and pleasure in it,
[stutters] and psychological utility.</a>
00:05:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h05m20s">But, that doesn't necessarily mean, that it's an intelligent....</a>
00:05:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h05m24s">It's certainly not a conservative strategy,
for moving forward through life.</a>
00:05:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h05m27s">So...</a>
00:05:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h05m28s">And you know, whenever I talk to people who are creative,</a>
00:05:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h05m31s">and you guys should listen to this,
because I know what I'm talking about.</a>
00:05:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h05m34s">If you happen to be creative: if you're
a songwriter, or another kind of musician,</a>
00:05:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h05m38s">or an artist, or any of the other number of things, that you might be...</a>
00:05:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h05m42s">Find a way to make money.
And then practice your craft on the side.</a>
00:05:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h05m47s">Because, you'll starve to death otherwise.</a>
00:05:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h05m50s">Now, some for some of you that won't be true, but it's a tiny minority.</a>
00:05:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h05m53s">Your best bet is to find a job,
that will keep body and soul together,</a>
00:05:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h05m56s">and parse off some time,
that you can pursue your creative thing.</a>
00:05:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h06m00s">Because then, well... as a long-term strategy,
your medium-to-long-term strategy, it's a better one.</a>
00:06:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h06m05s">But it's gotten incredibly difficult for people, musicians for example,</a>
00:06:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h06m08s">it's incredibly difficult for new musicians,
to monetize their... their craft.</a>
00:06:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h06m13s">Even if they're really, really good at it!</a>
00:06:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h06m15s">So, it's, it's...
Well, so anyways, so don't be...</a>
00:06:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h06m18s">So I say: "well, everyone's not creative".
And everybody goes: "Oh, that's terrible!"</a>
00:06:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h06m22s">It's like, it's not so terrible!
It's not someth-</a>
00:06:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw#t=00h06m24s">It's not self-evident, that you would curse
someone with high levels of creativity.</a>
