<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h00m17s">First of all, let's start- let's think about ethics to begin with, so what's the point of?</a>
00:00:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h00m23s">Conducting your life ethically? The answer that isn't so that you follow</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h00m30s">The answer to that is so that you balance your life, so that it is</a>
00:00:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h00m35s">Productive and meaningful as it can possibly be and that would be productive and meaningful for you, with any luck but, also</a>
00:00:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h00m41s">For people around you. That would even be better and for you now, and next week and into the future</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h00m58s">Universal something, like that although i think that it's it's better phrased</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h01m07s">So, when you're thinking about an ethic that has to do with any fundamental motivation, like sexuality</a>
00:01:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h01m12s">You have to think about it in the context of the rest of your life</a>

00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h01m27s">who's in control</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h01m29s">That's the issue. Is it you or is it the sexuality that's in control?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h02m05s">It seems to me that, sexuality is best handled within the confines of a relationship</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h02m12s">That's the classic ethical solution to the problem. It's because sexuality</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h02m20s">People don't like to think that. Especially people who i would say, are low In conscientiousness let's say or high and impulsivity</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h02m27s">it's easy for people to believe in</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h02m54s">There's no such thing as casual sex. I think the reason for that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h02m57s">Is that the consequences of sex are too dramatic.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h03m07s">As dramatic as consequences can be in life, but also the fact that</a>
00:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h03m14s">There's no disentangling sexual behavior from emotional behavior or maybe you could say</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h03m18s">Even worse if you try to disentangle your sexual behavior from your emotional behavior then i think what happens</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h03m26s">I mean if you're- let's say, if you're a serial- if you're a</a>
00:03:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h03m30s">If you have a lot of one-night stands and a lot of casual partners then</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h03m36s">First of all, there's not much discrimination between one partner and the other and so, in some sense you're in a loop</a>
00:03:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h03m41s">And and just repeating the same act over and over but, you can't</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h03m48s">that enables you to establish a relationship with another person and i think that that's a- I think that you corrupt your soul in</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h03m54s">That way. And that, you hurt yourself across time and of course you're going to hurt other people as well</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h04m00s">So i'm not a big admirer of the casual sex idea i think it's</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h04m10s">Now, healthy self-restraint, well with regards to sexuality it's the same with everything else is that there's there's the necessity to</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h04m19s">forego immediate gratification for the purpose of medium to long-term</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h04m23s">Thriving -let's say- so if your sexuality is integrated in an ethic that encompasses the rest of your life</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h04m30s">And if it serves that ethic, then i would say it's properly</a>
00:04:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h04m35s">Restrained. If it's unhealthily repressed, well then you're angry and bitter and resentful and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h04m42s">And, cursing the opposite sex or perhaps the same sex if you happen to be gay for</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k3sPGN2Gk#t=00h04m57s">Sexuality is restrained, so i hope hopefully that's a decent answer.</a>
