00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h00m02s">Tonight, I'd like to ask you about two different psychological disorders</a>
00:00:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h00m06s">the first being Borderline Personality Disorder</a>
00:00:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h00m09s">So, two lectures ago</a>
00:00:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h00m12s">somebody asked you about it, and you gave a very sparse answer</a>
00:00:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h00m16s">I can't remember exactly what you said, but it seemed like it was</a>
00:00:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h00m22s">it was too much complexity to just answer it right there and then</a>
00:00:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h00m25s">and then somebody else also asked you about the same disorder</a>
00:00:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h00m29s">in your patreon livestream recently</a>
00:00:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h00m32s">And when they asked you that, you kind of</a>
00:00:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h00m35s">you kind of stopped for a moment and</a>
00:00:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h00m37s">something, I don't know, something kind of flicked on in your head it seemed like, and you</a>
00:00:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h00m43s">and you thought for a couple of seconds, and then you said you know what, I don't think</a>
00:00:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h00m46s">that I can answer that right now because it's just too</a>
00:00:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h00m49s">it's just too bloody complex, and I was wondering</a>
00:00:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h00m53s">just like many young men have gravitated towards your lectures</a>
00:00:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h00m58s">do you think that there's something about this particular disorder that</a>
00:00:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h01m04s">there's something about people with this particular disorder that might gravitate to your insights and your lectures?</a>
00:01:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h01m10s">Okay, okay, so no I would say probably no to the second one</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h01m14s">but I could comment more about Borderline Personality Disorder</a>
00:01:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h01m17s">I think I have enough mental energy to do that tonight</a>
00:01:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h01m20s">so, technically speaking</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h01m23s">it's often considered the female variant of Antisocial Personality Disorder</a>
00:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h01m29s">So it's classified or</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h01m32s">it's classified in the domain of externalizing disorders; acting out disorders</a>
00:01:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h01m38s">And I think what happens</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h01m40s">We don't understand Borderline personality disorder very well, and it's characterized by</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h01m46s">tremendous impulsivity</a>
00:01:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h01m51s">radical confusion of identity</a>
00:01:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h01m54s">and then this pattern of idealization of</a>
00:01:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h01m58s">people with whom the</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h02m01s">person afflicted with the disorder</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h02m03s">is associating with. Radical idealization of those people and then radical devaluation of them</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h02m09s">And then there's another theme that sort of weaves along with it, which is</a>
00:02:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h02m13s">the proclivity of</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h02m15s">people with Borderline personality disorder to presume that they will be abandoned</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h02m20s">and then to act in a manner that makes such abandonment virtually certain</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h02m25s">And so, it's a very complicated</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h02m28s">disorder, but that</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h02m31s">I think gets at the crux of it</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h02m34s">One of the things that's interesting about</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h02m36s">people with Borderline Personality Disorder in my experience, is that they're often</a>
00:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h02m40s">quite intelligent and</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h02m43s">you see in the person with Borderline Personality Disorder</a>
00:02:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h02m47s">something like the waste or the squandering of tremendous potential</a>
00:02:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h02m52s">They seem capable of thinking through the nature of their problems</a>
00:02:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h02m57s">and analyzing them and discussing it, but not capable whatsoever of implementing any solutions</a>
00:02:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h03m13s">Technically, there's no relationship between IQ  conscientiousness</a>
00:03:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h03m19s">It's very weird</a>
00:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h03m20s">because if you read the neuropsychological literature</a>
00:03:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h03m24s">and you read about the functions of the pre-frontal cortex, they're usually conceptualized in intellectual terms</a>
00:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h03m30s">and they're associated with planning and strategizing and so forth</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h03m37s">that's what conscientiousness is, is planning  strategizing  implementation</a>
00:03:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h03m41s">but the correlation between IQ and conscientiousness is zero</a>
00:03:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h03m45s">and so is the correlation between working memory and conscientiousness, zero</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h03m50s">and zero is a very low correlation, right?</a>
00:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h03m53s">I mean, really it's hard to find things in psychology that are correlated at zero</a>
00:03:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h03m58s">Things tend to be correlated to some degree. They tend to be interrelated</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h04m03s">The Borderline seems to be able to strategize</a>
00:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h04m07s">and to abstract, but not to be able to implement</a>
00:04:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h04m11s">And so, the intellect per se seems to be functional, but</a>
00:04:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h04m17s">it's not embodied in action</a>
00:04:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h04m20s">It's very, so it can be</a>
00:04:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h04m22s">frustrating to be associated with someone who has Borderline Personality Disorder because</a>
00:04:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h04m27s">they can tell you what the problem is and even tell you what the solution might be, but</a>
00:04:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h04m31s">there's no implementation</a>
00:04:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h04m35s">So, maybe something went wrong developmentally</a>
00:04:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h04m38s">we don't know exactly how these sorts of things come about</a>
00:04:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h04m41s">The other thing that seems to be characteristic of Borderline</a>
00:04:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h04m44s">people with Borderline Personality Disorder is that they</a>
00:04:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h04m47s">they remind me very much of people who are 2 years old</a>
00:04:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h04m50s">and in some manner like</a>
00:04:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h04m53s">people with Borderline Personality Disorder can have temper tantrums, in fact they often do</a>
00:04:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h04m57s">and you know, now and then you see a temper tantrum</a>
00:04:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h05m00s">and they're usually thrown by 2-year-olds, right?</a>
00:05:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h05m02s">Most people grow out of temper tantrums by the time they're about 3</a>
00:05:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h05m06s">They're very rare at 4, which is a good thing, because if they're still there at 4</a>
00:05:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h05m10s">that is not a good diagnostic predictor</a>
00:05:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h05m12s">That's a.. it's actually a good diagnostic predictor, but it's not the kind that you want</a>
00:05:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h05m18s">and, you know, it's funny the way that we respond to 2-year-old temper tantrums because</a>
00:05:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h05m22s">the 2-year-old will throw themselves on the ground and beat their hands and their legs on the</a>
00:05:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h05m27s">floor and scream and yell and turn red or even blue</a>
00:05:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h05m29s">I saw a child once who was capable of holding his breath during a temper tantrum 'till he turned blue</a>
00:05:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h05m35s">which was really an impressive feat. You should try that right? It's really hard</a>
00:05:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h05m39s">you really have to work at it and</a>
00:05:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h05m42s">you see that in adult Borderlines, they'll have temper tantrums, and</a>
00:05:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h05m45s">the funny thing is when a 2-year-old does it it's like, it's you know, it's a little</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h05m49s">off-putting, but when an adult does it</a>
00:05:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h05m52s">it's completely bloody terrifying</a>
00:05:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h05m55s">and it happens very frequently with Borderlines and so, I would also say to some degree</a>
00:05:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h06m00s">they didn't get properly socialized between that critical period of development between 2 and 4</a>
00:06:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h06m05s">And you see the same thing with adult males who grow up to be anti-social</a>
00:06:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h06m09s">because a large proportion of adult males who grow up to be antisocial are aggressive as children, as 2-year-olds</a>
00:06:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h06m16s">So there's a small proportion of 2-year-olds who are quite aggressive, they'll kick and hit and bite and steal</a>
00:06:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h06m20s">if you put them with other 2-year-olds</a>
00:06:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h06m22s">It's about 5% of the of the males, smaller fraction of the females</a>
00:06:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h06m26s">but most of them are socialized by the time they're 4, but there's a small percentage who aren't</a>
00:06:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h06m31s">and they tend to stay antisocial and they tend to turn into long term offenders</a>
00:06:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h06m35s">and the critical period for socialization development seems to be between 2 and 4</a>
00:06:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h06m40s">and it seems to be mediated by pretend play and Rough-and-Tumble play and those sorts of mechanisms</a>
00:06:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h06m45s">and if it isn't instantiated by the age of 4</a>
00:06:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h06m48s">it doesn't happen, and it doesn't look like it's addressable</a>
00:06:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h06m52s">Now, there are</a>
00:06:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h06m54s">dialectic behavioral therapies that have been developed for people with Borderline Personality Disorder</a>
00:06:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs#t=00h06m59s">and they're purported to be successful</a>
