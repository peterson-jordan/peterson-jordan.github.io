about how the knowledge structures that we</a>
00:00:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h00m18s">inhabit might be built from the bottom up.</a>
00:00:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h00m20s">So I’m showing you this diagram because
it might clarify that a little bit.</a>
00:00:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h00m27s">What you see at the top - this is a hierarchy,
a partially built hierarchy and so one way</a>
00:00:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h00m34s">of thinking of an attribute like good when
you apply it to a person, or bad or evil or</a>
00:00:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h00m40s">wonderful, one way to think about it is as
a description of an object, but it’s not</a>
00:00:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h00m44s">really.</a>
00:00:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h00m45s">It’s shorthand for a set of - well I think
of them as micro personalities, but you can</a>
00:00:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h00m51s">also think about them as behavioral patterns.</a>
00:00:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h00m54s">Now, one of the things I mentioned to you
about - I talked to you a little bit about</a>
00:00:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h00m59s">words at one point, and what words signify
and this is a very complicated problem so</a>
00:00:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h01m05s">most of you are probably Augustinians without
even knowing it because St. Augustine originally</a>
00:01:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h01m11s">proposed that a word was a label for a thing.</a>
00:01:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h01m14s">Of course, that’s how people naturally think.</a>
00:01:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h01m17s">I’m sure most of you would regard that definition
as perfectly suitable, but it’s by no means</a>
00:01:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h01m24s">the only definition and it’s by no means
necessarily the correct definition.</a>
00:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h01m30s">There's a famous philosopher named Wittgenstein
who proposed instead that a word was like</a>
00:01:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h01m34s">a piece in a chess game which meant that it
was something that you did something with,</a>
00:01:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h01m41s">or you might think about it actually as a
tool.</a>
00:01:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h01m43s">And when you think about how you use words,
you can see that you're using them often as</a>
00:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h01m48s">tools to interact with other people for a
purpose.</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h01m57s">What I like about the tool idea - the tool
idea is a very evolutionary sophisticated</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h02m03s">concept, partly because we’re tool using
creatures probably beyond our other capacities</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h02m10s">except for possibly imitation and language
which set us so far apart from other animals,</a>
00:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h02m17s">but the thing about a tool is that the difference
between a tool and an object doesn't have</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h02m22s">a user.</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h02m23s">The word object doesn't imply user, but the
word tool implies user, and it’s not obvious</a>
00:02:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h02m28s">that we ever interact with anything in the
world without interacting with it in some</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h02m32s">motivated way.</a>
00:02:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h02m34s">And so, what we’re doing is we’re using
words to get through the world.</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h02m37s">To interact properly within the world and
to move where we want to go.</a>
00:02:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h02m42s">So that’s the second way of thinking about
a word.</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h02m44s">Here’s another way of thinking about a word.</a>
00:02:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h02m46s">A word is like a box of things and so imagine
that you cleaned out your basement and there's</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h02m52s">a bunch of boxes downstairs and one box is
labeled books.</a>
00:02:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h02m56s">Well inside that box, there could be any manner
of books.</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h03m00s">Books is a very very diverse set of phenomena.</a>
00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h03m06s">If you're moving, books are kind of condensed
into one thing which are kind of heavy objects</a>
00:03:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h03m11s">made out of paper.</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h03m14s">You can also imagine another box that says
things.</a>
00:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h03m17s">And in the thing box, I’m sure you have
a thing drawer at home where you put all the</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h03m21s">things you don't know what to do with so it’s
like the category of all things you don't</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h03m25s">know what to do with.</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h03m27s">Things.</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h03m28s">Okay so a word can also represent a relatively
heterogenous set of tools or entities.</a>
00:03:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h03m36s">That’s very very very useful to know because
one of the things that happens often when</a>
00:03:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h03m43s">people are arguing is that they use the same
word but each word contains a set of different</a>
00:03:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h03m48s">objects.</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h03m49s">You might say for example, is fear real?</a>
00:03:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h03m54s">Questions like that are very strange.</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h03m56s">They're not really answerable in some sense
because it depends on exactly what you mean</a>
00:03:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h04m00s">by fear because fear can contain a lot of
heterogenous entities, roughly speaking, and</a>
00:04:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h04m05s">it means - it also depends on what you mean
by real.</a>
00:04:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h04m09s">So you can define fear and you can define
real and so that fear is a subcategory of</a>
00:04:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h04m13s">real or you can define fear and you can define
fear so that fear isn’t a subset of real.</a>
00:04:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h04m19s">So, the idea that fear is a box that only
contains a certain set of entities or a certain</a>
00:04:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h04m26s">set of tools and that reality is the same
is wrong, and people argue about those sorts</a>
00:04:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h04m31s">of things all the time, and they make these
binary questions.</a>
00:04:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h04m34s">Is X a Y?</a>
00:04:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h04m35s">Well, X and Y are generally not well enough
to find so that you can easily find an answer</a>
00:04:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h04m41s">to a binary question like that.</a>
00:04:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h04m43s">Okay so, words can also represent a relatively
heterogenous set of attributes or objects</a>
00:04:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h04m49s">or tools.</a>
00:04:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h04m50s">When you say that someone’s a good person
for example, you don’t mean they’re a</a>
00:04:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h04m55s">good person all the time or that everything
they’ve ever done is good because they wouldn't</a>
00:04:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h05m01s">be a good person then, they would be a saint
or some other fictional character like that.</a>
00:05:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h05m06s">So, when you’re applying the label - we’ll
call it label for the purposes of this argument.</a>
00:05:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h05m11s">It’s a descriptive tool actually.</a>
00:05:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h05m14s">When you’re applying a term like that to
someone, it’s a shorthand for a variety</a>
00:05:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h05m18s">of states that this person could exist in.</a>
00:05:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h05m21s">The majority of which you regard as positive.</a>
00:05:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h05m24s">You might say he’s a better person than
she is, and then you’d say well the proportion</a>
00:05:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h05m28s">of attributes that she has - I think I said
she, whatever - it exceeds the proportion</a>
00:05:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h05m35s">of positives that this other person has.</a>
00:05:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h05m38s">So the other way you can think about a word
is - this is more complicated, it involves</a>
00:05:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h05m42s">a little bit of visualization.</a>
00:05:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h05m43s">So imagine you have a child’s train on a
track.</a>
00:05:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h05m46s">It’s going around and around the track.</a>
00:05:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h05m48s">And it’s got cars on it that you can put
things in, and all the cars are full of things,</a>
00:05:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h05m53s">and then on the track there’s a box with
cutouts in it so that the train can pass through,</a>
00:05:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h05m58s">and on top of the box is a word.</a>
00:05:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h06m01s">And the word is things, and the train is going

00:06:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h06m05s">In some sense, what that would mean - imagine
the train is long enough - at any given second,</a>
00:06:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h06m09s">the box of things would contain different
things, but it would still be a box of things.</a>
00:06:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h06m14s">And a lot of words we use are like that.</a>
00:06:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h06m16s">Not only do they represent a heterogenous
set of entities, but the set changes depending</a>
00:06:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h06m24s">on the context that we use the word in.</a>
00:06:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h06m27s">So the reason I’m telling you that is because
a word, here’s another way of thinking about</a>
00:06:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h06m32s">a word.</a>
00:06:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h06m33s">This will be good for you computer - well
you’re all computer people now of course.</a>
00:06:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h06m39s">A word is a low resolution image.</a>
00:06:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h06m43s">So you think about it.</a>
00:06:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h06m47s">A word is a good enough approximation of the
thing that it’s representing.</a>
00:06:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h06m50s">Sort of like a thumbnail.</a>
00:06:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h06m52s">Now obviously one of the differences of a
thumbnail and the real thing is that the real</a>
00:06:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h06m56s">thing exists at a much more, much higher level
of resolution.</a>
00:06:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h07m01s">It exists at many, many more layers.</a>
00:07:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h07m03s">You can use the thumbnail to represent it.</a>
00:07:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h07m06s">The advantage to doing that is that it doesn’t
take up much processing time, and it doesn’t</a>
00:07:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h07m11s">take up much memory.</a>
00:07:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h07m12s">So lots of time, you want to use the shorthand
for the thing rather than the thing because</a>
00:07:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h07m16s">it’s just too complicated otherwise.</a>
00:07:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h07m18s">And then you might say well how do you know
your shorthand representation is a good representation</a>
00:07:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h07m25s">of the thing you're trying to represent, and
the pragmatists would say well it depends</a>
00:07:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h07m29s">on what you want to do with it.</a>
00:07:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h07m31s">That’s the tool-like aspect.</a>
00:07:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h07m33s">It’s like if you’re using word X to represent
potentially heterogeneous class Y, and when</a>
00:07:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h07m40s">you use it, you get to where you're want or
you get close enough to where you want, then</a>
00:07:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h07m44s">it’s good enough.</a>
00:07:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h07m45s">So it’s like how you know a joke is good
enough, well someone laughs.</a>
00:07:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h07m49s">Okay, the joke is good enough, and so one
of the things that’s quite interesting about</a>
00:07:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h07m55s">the way you interact with the world, and this
is something the pragmatists really discovered</a>
00:07:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h07m59s">in some sense, was that you're always aiming
at some bounded set of events that’s somewhat</a>
00:07:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h08m05s">different than the current set of events because
otherwise you could just sit there, and then</a>
00:08:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h08m09s">you put your conceptions to work and your
actions to work to manage the transformation,</a>
00:08:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h08m14s">and if you manage the transformation, then
it’s good enough.</a>
00:08:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h08m19s">You don’t have to go any farther than that.</a>
00:08:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h08m21s">So that explains partly how you can maneuver
in the world with limited knowledge.</a>
00:08:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h08m26s">You use low resolution representations to
partially hit vague goals, and that generally</a>
00:08:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h08m33s">gets you there.</a>
00:08:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h08m34s">That process was called satisficing by - now
what’s his name, an extraordinarily famous</a>
00:08:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h08m41s">economist and psychologist.</a>
00:08:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h08m43s">Anyone remember who coined the word satisficing?</a>
00:08:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h08m45s">Well, an economist psychologist would be Herb
Simon.</a>
00:08:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h08m48s">That’s right, it’s Simon.</a>
00:08:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h08m50s">It was Herb Simon, and you know he said well,
you’re often not out to optimize.</a>
00:08:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h08m54s">Let’s say in a search for a partner, to
optimize it you’d have to search through</a>
00:08:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h08m59s">several billion people.</a>
00:08:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h09m00s">Well you’re not gonna do that because you
don’t have the time.</a>
00:09:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h09m04s">So then you might say well, you don’t know
exactly how to do it but it’s something</a>
00:09:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h09m08s">this.</a>
00:09:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h09m09s">You have five attributes that you’re looking
for and maybe two that you don’t know you’re</a>
00:09:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h09m13s">looking for but you are looking for, and the
first person that comes along that matches</a>
00:09:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h09m17s">those well enough, you pick.</a>
00:09:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h09m20s">So it’s not an optimization issue, but given
that you have a limited amount of time, you</a>
00:09:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h09m25s">can’t wait around for optimized solutions.</a>
00:09:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h09m27s">You have to go ahead with sufficient, and
then move to the next issue.</a>
00:09:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h09m33s">Okay, so all that’s a conceptual precursor
for taking a look at this diagram.</a>
00:09:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h09m41s">So we’re calling someone a good person.</a>
00:09:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h09m43s">So what does it mean?</a>
00:09:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h09m44s">Well we’re going to do a bit of a microanalysis.</a>
00:09:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h09m45s">We’re going to assume it’s a bit of a
shorthand, low resolution representation of</a>
00:09:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h09m49s">the person and that you can decompose it.</a>
00:09:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h09m52s">If someone says X is a - Henry is a good person,
and maybe he’s 45.</a>
00:09:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h09m57s">You might say does he have children?</a>
00:09:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h09m59s">Then you might say yes.</a>
00:09:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h10m00s">Then you might say well is he a good parent
because you might assume that if he’s a</a>
00:10:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h10m03s">good person, he might be a good parent.</a>
00:10:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h10m05s">Now it’s conceivable that he can be a good
parent without being a good parent if he was</a>
00:10:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h10m10s">good at five other important things.</a>
00:10:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h10m12s">But let’s assume as a good person he’s
also a good parent.</a>
00:10:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h10m16s">I think it’s reasonable to assume that good
parent would be a subset of good person, right,</a>
00:10:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h10m21s">because it’s more specific.</a>
00:10:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h10m23s">More specific means it covers less time and
space in some sense because good person is</a>
00:10:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h10m28s">a description of a person that covers how
the person interacts with the world across</a>
00:10:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h10m33s">the broadest possible amount of time and location.</a>
00:10:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h10m36s">And then good parent, well you can find that
out when they’re interacting with children</a>
00:10:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h10m41s">let’s say for the sake of argument.</a>
00:10:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h10m42s">There’s other issues, and then you might
say well if he’s a good parent what does</a>
00:10:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h10m46s">he have to do to be a good parent?</a>
00:10:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h10m49s">Well he has to feed his children so he probably
needs a job, and it would be better if it</a>
00:10:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h10m53s">was a good job.</a>
00:10:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h10m54s">So he’s got a good job and that’s part
of being a good person.</a>
00:10:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h10m58s">And then maybe he can care for his family
and so care might be regarded as a more specific</a>
00:10:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h11m05s">subset of good parent, and so you can decompose
caring to, let’s say, play with baby, and</a>
00:11:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h11m11s">then you can decompose play into - well I
decomposed it into peek, tickle, and clean.</a>
00:11:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h11m17s">What’s interesting about this is those are
all abstractions, but once you get down to</a>
00:11:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h11m22s">a high enough level of resolution, they’re
no longer abstractions in that they’re actually</a>
00:11:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h11m26s">actions you undertake in the world.</a>
00:11:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h11m28s">Moving your hand is not an abstraction.</a>
00:11:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h11m31s">So at some point - and this is a nice elegant
solution to the mind body problem to some</a>
00:11:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h11m35s">degree.</a>
00:11:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h11m36s">At some level of resolution - high resolution
- it stops being conceptual and starts being</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h11m41s">action, and that's where the mind hits the
world.</a>
00:11:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h11m45s">If you go into an even higher level of resolution
than that, like what do you have to do to</a>
00:11:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h11m50s">move your hand?</a>
00:11:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h11m51s">The answer to that is you don’t know.</a>
00:11:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h11m53s">You just do it.</a>
00:11:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h11m54s">And so your consciousness bottoms out, in
some sense, at the level of motor activity.</a>
00:11:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h11m59s">So there’s a level above which you can’t

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h12m37s">I think about them in these terms, so if you
look at - that’s where we get to this particular</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h12m43s">diagram which we’re gonna concentrate on

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h12m47s">Let me shift to it and we’ll talk about
that.</a>
00:12:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h13m11s">Now I don’t exactly know how to - what to
call this thing.</a>
00:13:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h13m28s">I think the best way of thinking about it
is it’s a subpersonality and that the reason</a>
00:13:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h13m34s">I call it a subpersonality is because only
a personality has all the attributes that</a>
00:13:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h13m38s">this thing has and so the attributes are.</a>
00:13:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h13m40s">I talked to you last week about the fact that
the Russian neuropsychologist for example</a>
00:13:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h13m45s">felt that people had to build models of the
world and so you can call this a model of</a>
00:13:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h13m50s">the world.</a>
00:13:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h13m52s">So the reason they suspected that was because
if you brought someone - I think I ran through</a>
00:13:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h13m58s">this - if you bring someone into a laboratory
and you play them a tone, when they first</a>
00:13:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h14m02s">hear the tone they manifest an orienting reflex
which is a change in skin conduction, and</a>
00:14:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h14m07s">that’s actually a consequence of neurological
activity.</a>
00:14:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h14m10s">And then if you play the tone a bunch, they
stop having the reaction and then if you vary</a>
00:14:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h14m14s">the tone on any perceptible dimension, the
orienting reflex returns, and so the inference</a>
00:14:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h14m23s">from that is obviously the person must be
constructing a model of the tone because otherwise</a>
00:14:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h14m31s">how would they know if something deviated
from it, especially on all those dimensions.</a>
00:14:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h14m35s">So not only is it a model, it’s a multi-dimensional
model.</a>
00:14:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h14m40s">Okay, now the upshot of that is for a long
time, people tried to figure out how in the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h14m45s">world we model the world, and then they tried
to figure out how to make smart machines that</a>
00:14:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h14m49s">modeled the world that could then plan their

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h14m56s">They got nowhere with that because it turned
out that the world is so damn complex that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h15m00s">if you’re gonna model it, you’re gonna
spend all the time modeling.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h15m07s">It’s partly because the world is almost

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h15m19s">I mean, you look at a lot in some ways, and
not very much in others, and half your brain</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h15m28s">Then you’ve got your other senses to help

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h15m32s">But you don’t build a model of the whole

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h15m38s">For example, your model of this floor is very
low resolution.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h15m47s">I said, what was the color of this floor.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h15m49s">You would not be able to tell me, and the
reason for that is who cares.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h15m52s">It could be shifting color all the time while

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h15m58s">The reason for that is you’re not falling

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h16m01s">So it’s like an invisible presupposition

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h16m31s">So that’s something eh.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h16m32s">It’s really something that there's a psychology

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h16m38s">It’s like, of course I can see a gorilla

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h16m47s">Now the reason for that is, fundamentally
speaking, is you're given a task when you</a>
00:16:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h16m54s">watch that video, and the task is to count
the number of times the ball is thrown by</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h17m01s">All of a sudden, your perceptual systems reorient
themselves and you're not really looking at</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h17m07s">You’re looking at something that might be

00:17:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h17m19s">So you can blur them out, which you do because
obviously you can’t tell the difference</a>
00:17:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h17m22s">between a gorilla and the person dressed in

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h17m26s">The reason you can’t is you don't need to.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h17m28s">In order to fulfill the task, you can treat
all the people like vaguely moving black objects,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h17m35s">and as long as that doesn't interfere with
your counting, then it’s irrelevant.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h17m39s">So actually, you don’t build a model of

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h17m43s">And you build a model of only the parts of

know what’s relevant.</a>
00:17:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h17m53s">Well that’s a tough question.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h17m55s">I would say, the reason you know what’s
relevant is because some things don’t change</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h18m01s">over time, and you’ve been evolving through

00:25:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h26m03s">Well here’s one way of getting a bit of
sense of it.</a>
00:26:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h26m07s">Look straight ahead.</a>
00:26:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h26m08s">Okay, now concentrate not on what you see
in the middle of your vision but at the sides.</a>
00:26:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h26m15s">It’s probably better if you look at a person
to do that, but it doesn’t really matter</a>
00:26:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h26m18s">though.</a>
00:26:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h26m19s">So look straight ahead but pay attention to
what you see in the periphery.</a>
00:26:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h26m23s">So I can tell you what you’ll see because
some of it is very difficult to detect.</a>
00:26:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h26m29s">Way out in the periphery, it’s black and
white.</a>
00:26:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h26m33s">You can't tell that though.</a>
00:26:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h26m34s">But we know that because if we change colors
way out in the periphery on you, you can't</a>
00:26:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h26m38s">detect a change.</a>
00:26:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h26m39s">And then out to about here, if something isn't
moving, it’s almost impossible to see it.</a>
00:26:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h26m44s">But as soon as it moves, you can see that
there’s something moving.</a>
00:26:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h26m47s">Sort of like dinosaur vision.</a>
00:26:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h26m49s">Remember Jurassic Park?</a>
00:26:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h26m52s">Don’t move because the dinosaur can see
you.</a>
00:26:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h26m54s">It’s like well, you have dinosaur movement
detector still built into your nervous system.</a>
00:26:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h26m59s">And the answer is why, and the answer is well
if you can't afford to have a lot of your</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h27m05s">brain wired up in the periphery of your vision
because your head is only so big, then you</a>
00:27:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h27m10s">have to concentrate on only those things that
are most likely to be relevant.</a>
00:27:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h27m15s">And moving things are more likely to be relevant
because they can eat you.</a>
00:27:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h27m19s">Moving things are more likely to be relevant
than stationary things especially if you've</a>
00:27:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h27m23s">been in the environment for a while right,
because if you're in here it’s like the</a>
00:27:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h27m27s">stationary things are going to stay stationary
so you can ignore them.</a>
00:27:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h27m30s">You don't even have to see them, but the moving
things, they’re transforming at a time rate</a>
00:27:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h27m35s">that’s relevant to you so it’s good to
be able to detect those.</a>
00:27:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h27m39s">Now the periphery of your vision is actually
wired in more directly to your - to the lower</a>
00:27:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h27m45s">levels of your nervous system.</a>
00:27:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h27m47s">So it can trigger off things like startle
reflexes which are very rapid, and it can</a>
00:27:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h27m52s">also trigger an orienting response which is
the movement of your sensory systems in the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h27m56s">direction of the stimulus so if something
over here moves, then you go like that, and</a>
00:27:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h28m01s">then what you're doing is you're nailing it
with your central vision.</a>
00:28:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h28m04s">Now, out in your peripheral vision, if you
follow the optical tract back to your brain,</a>
00:28:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h28m09s">you'll see the peripheral retinal nerves don't
attach to a tremendous number of visual cortex</a>
00:28:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h28m17s">neurons, but the central ones do so each of
the central neurons in your central vision</a>
00:28:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h28m23s">- the fovea.</a>
00:28:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h28m24s">Each one of those is connected to ten thousand
neurons at the first level of elaboration,</a>
00:28:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h28m30s">and then each neuron is connected to about
ten thousand other neurons.</a>
00:28:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h28m33s">So it’s ten thousand to the ten thousandth
two neurons in and so a lot of your brain</a>
00:28:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h28m39s">is focusing on that tiny little pinpoint that
you use that’s foveal vision, and it seems</a>
00:28:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h28m44s">to be about big enough so that you can bring
a face into high resolution in the center</a>
00:28:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h28m50s">and you can track the movement of the various
elements of the faces.</a>
00:28:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h28m54s">If you look at someone and you look about
eighteen inches to their left or to their</a>
00:28:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h28m58s">right, you'll see that you can't see their
nose anymore.</a>
00:28:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h29m02s">You see kind of a vague outline of their face.</a>
00:29:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h29m05s">You can still see the color.</a>
00:29:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h29m06s">You can detect their eyebrows, and you can
detect their mouth especially if their mouth</a>
00:29:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h29m10s">moves or their eyes move.</a>
00:29:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h29m12s">You just zero in on that right away.</a>
00:29:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h29m15s">What’s happening is that way out here, your
vision is incredibly low resolution and the</a>
00:29:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h29m21s">resolution increases to the center where it’s
very very high, and then there's some tweaks</a>
00:29:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h29m27s">like okay you can't really see out here, but
you can see motion, and that's good enough</a>
00:29:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h29m31s">because as soon as something moves, you can
turn your head cause you can turn your head</a>
00:29:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h29m34s">and your eyes and you can focus that little
pinpoint on it and dance around cause that's</a>
00:29:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h29m39s">what you do with the pinpoint.</a>
00:29:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h29m41s">It moves around very rapidly, and you can
scan that central area with high resolution.</a>
00:29:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h29m47s">So it’s an efficient use of limited resources.</a>
00:29:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h29m51s">So partly the way that you manage in the world
which is very very complicated, is that even</a>
00:29:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h29m57s">your senses simplify it for you.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h29m59s">There's only - you can't see the entire spectrum

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h30m04s">You can only see the visual light spectrum.</a>
00:30:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h30m06s">It’s very narrow.</a>
00:30:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h30m07s">There’s a whole range of sounds you can't

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h30m10s">There's things you can't smell.</a>
00:30:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h30m11s">So you're in a box and some things get through,
but not everything.</a>
00:30:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h30m15s">So that simplifies things for you right off
the bat and hypothetically those things you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h30m25s">this vast span of time and no doubt there
were variants all the way through that tried</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h30m39s">So it’s an interesting take on death, eh,
because you're the product of an unbelievable</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h30m47s">Right, because all of those experiments had
to take place in some sense for you to be</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h30m55s">So anyways, okay, then, so you can see with
your central vision that you focus in on one</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h32m18s">people often report that time slows down dramatically,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h33m04s">because if you understand the metaphor well,
it really sheds some light on what human beings</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h33m12s">Chimps are hunters, but they're not hunters
like human beings are hunters.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h33m15s">We’re really really good hunters.</a>
00:33:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h33m17s">Chimps, they have to kind of mob an animal
and then they’ll tear it apart, and they</a>
00:33:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h33m21s">like meat so they’ll definitely do it.</a>
00:33:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h33m24s">But human beings have been hunting in an unbelievably
sophisticated way for a tremendous amount</a>
00:33:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h33m28s">of time, and there's a bunch of things about
us that aren't like chimps.</a>
00:33:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h33m33s">So one is we can throw, and our bodies are
built for throwing.</a>
00:33:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h33m37s">Now you might think well that's not that relevant
but if something is chasing you through the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h33m41s">bush and you can throw a rock at it, it becomes
relevant very quickly.</a>
00:33:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h33m45s">And so we’re really good at taking projectiles,
specifying targets, and hurling the projectiles</a>
00:33:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h33m51s">at targets.</a>
00:33:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h33m52s">And we can do that with rocks, and we can
do it with bows, and we can do it with rifles,</a>
00:33:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h33m56s">and we can do it with rifles, and we can do
it with nuclear weapons.</a>
00:33:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h33m59s">And so there's something about us that's obsessed
with hitting the middle of the target.</a>
00:33:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h34m04s">Now there's an interesting side note for that
which is that the word sin is derived from</a>
00:34:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h34m11s">the Greek word “Hamartia,” and hamartia
is an archery term to mean to miss the center</a>
00:34:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h34m17s">of the target.</a>
00:34:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h34m18s">Now that's something very much worth thinking
about.</a>
00:34:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h34m21s">It’s a very lovely concordance.</a>
00:34:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h34m23s">So we’re built on this hunting platform.</a>
00:34:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h34m25s">We can track moving things extraordinarily
well.</a>
00:34:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h34m28s">We have amazing eyesight.</a>
00:34:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h34m30s">Our eyesight’s better than any primate by
a huge amount, and better than any other creature</a>
00:34:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h34m34s">except for hawks and other birds of prey.</a>
00:34:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h34m37s">So, and, we also use - so we have this intense,
amazing capacity to zero in and here’s some</a>
00:34:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h34m43s">cool things about your eyes.</a>
00:34:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h34m44s">So, if you look at a gorilla, you’ll see
that a gorilla doesn't really have whites</a>
00:34:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h34m48s">in their eyes, and you might think well that's
kind of weird because we do, and so what's</a>
00:34:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h34m53s">the hypothesis?</a>
00:34:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h34m54s">Well, if I’m looking at somebody at the
back of the room, I can tell if they're looking</a>
00:34:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h34m59s">at my eyes.</a>
00:34:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h35m01s">If they're looking at my nose, it’s almost
as if their face just gets a little bit vaguer</a>
00:35:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h35m05s">like we’re not communicating.</a>
00:35:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h35m06s">It’s eye to eye contact.</a>
00:35:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h35m08s">So our ability to specify the direction in
which another person’s eyes are pointing</a>
00:35:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h35m15s">is phenomenal.</a>
00:35:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h35m17s">And you might say, well why?</a>
00:35:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h35m18s">Well first of all, there’s a lot of expression
around the eyes right.</a>
00:35:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h35m23s">So you can imagine coevolution.</a>
00:35:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h35m24s">The coevolution is sharper and sharper vision.</a>
00:35:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h35m28s">Vision associated with detecting eyes and
then also more and more evolution for emotional</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h35m33s">expression around the eyes.</a>
00:35:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h35m36s">So there's that.</a>
00:35:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h35m37s">But then, the other thing that I wanted - the
reason that I would be interested in that</a>
00:35:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h35m41s">is because I want to know what the hell you’re
up to because maybe you're a friend and maybe</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h35m46s">you're a foe or maybe you're interested in

00:35:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h35m49s">So we know what people are like in that regard,
so you go stand out in the corner and you</a>
00:35:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h35m54s">look up, and soon there are ten people you

00:35:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h35m58s">And why is that?</a>
00:35:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h35m59s">It’s because when they see where your eyes
are pointed and embody you, they think well</a>
00:35:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h36m06s">that person - they don’t think this.</a>
00:36:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h36m08s">It’s the equivalent of thinking.</a>
00:36:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h36m09s">They think well that person must be looking

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h36m13s">people look at, and if it’s interesting
to them then it’s probably going to be interesting</a>
00:36:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h36m17s">to me especially if it’s in the sky.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h36m19s">It’s like what the hell, that’s not supposed

00:36:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h36m22s">So you're looking at people’s eyes because
you want to know what they're up to in their</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h36m33s">That tells you what they're up to, which is
why you want to see someone’s face.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h36m37s">You don't talk to the back of their head.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h36m45s">Although too much eye contact is a predatory

00:36:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h36m48s">So you know, you’ve got -
Well you’ve got to get the balance right.</a>
00:36:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h36m52s">So now, what about the whites of the eyes?</a>
00:36:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h36m55s">Well the theory is that the reason we’ve
developed whites is because it was easier</a>
00:36:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h36m59s">to see where someone’s eyes were pointed

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h37m03s">and what that basically meant was that all

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h39m44s">I do know why red.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h39m55s">So that's why - you know that too.</a>
00:39:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h39m57s">You just have to leaf through a women’s
magazine.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h39m59s">Lipstick is always associated with like apples

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h40m04s">or something like that.</a>
00:40:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h40m05s">And we were primarily fruit eaters, and the
reason we have color vision is to detect fruit,</a>
00:40:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h40m11s">ripe fruit.</a>
00:40:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h40m13s">So part of the reason that - also part of
the reason that fruit turns red or colors</a>
00:40:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h40m17s">when it ripens is because the fruit that was
successfully eaten by creatures that distributed</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h40m22s">the seeds was the fruit that was ripe when
it was eaten.</a>
00:40:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h40m26s">So as the color vision evolved, maybe there
was a red tint for only god knows what reason,</a>
00:40:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h40m31s">then a positive feedback loop developed and
fruit got redder and redder, and at the same</a>
00:40:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h40m35s">time, women capitalized on that.</a>
00:40:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h40m38s">So that’s partly, I think, what explains
the association between Eve and the apple</a>
00:40:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h40m43s">in Genesis because Genesis is also a story
about gaining sight.</a>
00:40:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h40m48s">So yeah, that’s why red.</a>
00:40:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h40m50s">That’s pretty funny.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h41m00s">It’s so deep inside of us.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h41m05s">Yeah.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h41m07s">I have to wonder about blood too, that seems
like it also</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h41m09s">Oh yeah, yeah.</a>
00:41:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h41m10s">Red’s a significant color, but I think - I
mean and it’s funny too because say there’s</a>
00:41:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h41m13s">a flushed face, well that means it’s infused
with blood.</a>
00:41:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h41m17s">It’s also a sign of health.</a>
00:41:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h41m18s">It’s also a sign of sexual arousal.</a>
00:41:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h41m21s">But it is a sign of health, and so you see
in old Coke ads from the 1930’s, the girl’s</a>

00:41:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h41m30s">So it’s a form of sexual signalling that
indicates health.</a>
00:41:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h41m36s">So that's another part.</a>
00:41:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h41m37s">I mean these are multiply determined right,
as anything as complex as vision.</a>
00:41:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h41m41s">Yeah, and blood means “Hey, maybe don’t
go there” or maybe it means there’s something</a>
00:41:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h41m45s">to eat.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h41m48s">There was another theory with color sight,
and it had to do with people’s facial expressions</a>
00:41:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h41m52s">- not expressions but depending on whether
you're angry or aroused.</a>
00:41:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h42m00s">Oh definitely, you can see that those things
would loop together.</a>
00:42:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h42m04s">Once the color vision starts to adapt, the
color vision for fruit is way older, I would</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h42m10s">suspect, because when we developed it, we
had fur.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h42m14s">But once the ability’s there and we lose
our facial fur, it’s possible to capitalize</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h42m19s">on the ability to detect the signalling.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h42m21s">And you know, we’re talking about a transformation
that's over about - we were living in trees</a>

Norbert Wiener way back in the 1940’s.</a>
00:43:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h43m23s">In fact there was a convention back in the
1940’s that Wiener presented many of his</a>

including Jean Piaget.</a>
00:43:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h43m32s">So Piaget’s theory is very much influenced
by cybernetics as well.</a>
00:43:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h43m37s">Many many of the standard psychology cognitive
models are cybernetic.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h43m43s">So they're grounded in thinking that's grounded
in the engineering thinking and not psychological</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h44m10s">So here's a funny story.</a>
00:44:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h44m11s">There's a little animal whose name I forget,

00:44:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h44m20s">Okay so in its juvenile state, it has to coordinate
its movements and interact with the changing</a>

00:44:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h44m27s">So it has a brain.</a>
00:44:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h44m29s">But when it turns into an adult, it attaches
itself to a rock and turns into something</a>
00:44:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h44m33s">like a piece of coral.</a>
00:44:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h44m35s">It promptly digests its own brain.</a>
00:44:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h44m38s">So the issue is unless you don't really need
a brain if you're not gonna go anywhere right.</a>
00:44:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h44m42s">So a brain is a going places thing, and we
have a very big brain and so it’s like we’re</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h44m47s">always zooming around doing things, and we've
got these hands that enable us to manipulate</a>

00:44:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h44m53s">So the brain is for doing things, it’s not
just for perceiving.</a>
00:44:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h44m58s">Roughly speaking, the back half of your brain
is for perception, the cortical part.</a>
00:44:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h45m03s">Mostly visual perception, but some auditory
and touch.</a>
00:45:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h45m05s">A lot of visual, and the front part is for
output.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h45m09s">Motor action.</a>
00:45:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h45m11s">And as you proceed - imagine the front part
starts halfway here.</a>
00:45:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h45m16s">As you proceed from the midline forward, the
action becomes more and more abstract until</a>
00:45:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h45m21s">when you're dealing with the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex, you're thinking abstractly.</a>
00:45:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h45m26s">Now people think that when they're thinking
abstractly, they're thinking about representations</a>
00:45:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h45m30s">of the world because we think about objects,
but that isn't what we’re doing.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h45m35s">What we’re doing is rehearsing potential
schemas of action.</a>
00:45:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h45m40s">So we have this abstract space, which you
might think about as a duplicate world.</a>
00:45:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h45m44s">You have an idea.</a>
00:45:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h45m46s">You test the idea like you would test it if
you were acting in the world, and the consequence</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h45m51s">of the imaginary testing is if you encounter
grief, then you don't implement the idea in</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h45m57s">Now you know, that doesn't always work because
there's trade offs between short term pleasure</a>
00:45:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h46m01s">and long term punishment that makes it complicated,
but what seems to have happened is that as</a>

00:46:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h46m10s">For billions of years, the only way that you
could figure out whether you're right or wrong</a>
00:46:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h46m15s">was to go out and do something, and if you
died you were wrong.</a>
00:46:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h46m18s">But now, you can think about doing something
and if the consequence of running the simulation</a>

00:46:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h46m28s">So what you're basically doing is spinning
off multiple potential use in multiple potential</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h46m34s">universes and running them as simulations.</a>
00:46:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h46m37s">Now we really do that now because we’ve
externalized it onto the computer which is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h46m41s">what we’re doing with really really complex

00:46:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h46m44s">So it’s so smart.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h46m48s">Now it doesn't work that well because sometimes
you run the simulation and you think, this</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h46m54s">is a stupid idea, and you promptly have eight

00:46:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h46m58s">But, all things considered, that’s still
what this abstract space is for.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h47m04s">I should tell you something about this too
because you're gonna hear from neuropsychologists</a>
00:47:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h47m08s">that a lot of what the dorsolateral prefrontal

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h47m19s">And part of the reason I know this is because
the correlation between prefrontal cortical</a>

to come up with a new grading scheme.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h49m51s">Right, because you come up with something

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h49m54s">Well what do you do with that?</a>

is divorced almost completely from embodiment,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h50m14s">and that's a good thing because that allows

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h50m50s">But then as you practice the task, and routinize
it, less and less brain is involved.</a>
00:50:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h50m56s">So what happens is - this is in your standard,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h52m04s">So, people used to talk about the development

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h52m09s">that that was absolutely right because character

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h52m15s">it really really matters.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h52m25s">Okay, so back to this.</a>
00:52:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h52m28s">Now, Gray and Sokolov and Vinogradova.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h52m31s">We’re gonna talk about them for a minute.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h52m36s">They're mostly thinking about animals - rats,
mostly - as having an expectancy model.</a>
00:52:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h52m41s">So you take a rat.</a>
00:52:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h52m43s">You throw him in a new environment.</a>
00:52:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h52m46s">What does he do?</a>
00:52:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h52m47s">Well the first he does is freeze because god
only knows what’s out there.</a>
00:52:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h52m52s">So it’s like paralyzed rat; he’s just
seen the Medusa.</a>
00:52:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h52m55s">He’s paralyzed, and then if nothing attacks
him, he starts to calm down a bit and then</a>
00:52:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h53m01s">he’ll start sniffing because rats are all
smell.</a>
00:53:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h53m04s">And he sniffs around, and he’s trying to
detect cats, say.</a>
00:53:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h53m08s">Now, rats have such a good sense of smell.</a>
00:53:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h53m11s">If a rat eats somethign that makes it sick,
it’ll never eat it again.</a>
00:53:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h53m15s">But, if a rat smells the breath of a rat that
ate something that made it sick, he won’t</a>
00:53:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h53m20s">eat that either.</a>
00:53:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h53m21s">Right, so rats eh.</a>
00:53:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h53m23s">Man, they can smell things.</a>
00:53:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h53m25s">And animals are built around a smell brain,
so they're a lot different than us.</a>
00:53:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h53m29s">We have - did I tell you about the t-shirt
study of symmetrical men?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h53m35s">Oh that’s a funny one.</a>
00:53:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h53m38s">So we know that one of the things that signify
physical beauty is symmetry, and the reason</a>
00:53:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h53m43s">for that is that all things considered, symmetrical
people are more healthy than asymmetrical</a>
00:53:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h53m50s">people.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h53m51s">Asymmetry indicates taht somethings gone wrong

00:53:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h53m55s">So, we like symmetry and beauty.</a>
00:53:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h54m01s">And that's fine.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h54m02s">That’s all the way across the animal kingdom.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h54m03s">So butterflies.</a>
00:54:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h54m04s">There are butterflies that wont mate with
another butterfly if it deviates from symmetry</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h54m08s">some absurdly tiny amount.</a>
00:54:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h54m10s">Like really, it’s micro measurement deviation.</a>

00:54:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h54m28s">So symmetry.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h54m29s">This researcher, god only knows what possessed

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h55m37s">- they were basically daycare for kids.</a>
00:55:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h55m43s">Group day care.</a>
00:55:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h55m44s">But the kids were more separated from the
parents than they might be in a regular day</a>
00:55:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h55m49s">care.</a>
00:55:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h55m50s">Anyways, all the Israeli kids were in these
kibbutzim, and so then we have detailed marriage</a>
00:55:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h55m54s">records of the kids.</a>
00:55:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h55m57s">You know that people very seldom marry their
siblings, and they're very seldomly in a sexual</a>
00:55:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h56m02s">relationship with their siblings, and you
might say well why is that.</a>
00:56:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h56m05s">It’s the case across cultures, with very
specific exceptions like often high rank nobility</a>
00:56:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h56m11s">- they have an option.</a>
00:56:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h56m14s">Generally speaking, there's a powerful incest
taboo, as well as between parents and children.</a>
00:56:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h56m20s">So, some researcher decided well how do you
know who you're sibling is, you know roughly</a>
00:56:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h56m27s">speaking.</a>
00:56:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h56m28s">What exactly is it that’s not turning you
on, let’s say.</a>
00:56:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h56m32s">Well so they checked out the kibbutzim records
and they found that Israeli children who were</a>
00:56:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h56m37s">raised in the same kibbutzim never married
each other.</a>
00:56:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h56m42s">Whatever happened seemed to - it was as if
that close, close contact in the very early</a>
00:56:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h56m49s">years triggered whatever the sibling anti-response
is and that was that.</a>
00:56:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h56m55s">It’s probably smell.</a>
00:56:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h56m57s">That would be my guess.</a>
00:56:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h56m58s">Now, there’s also another study.</a>
00:56:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h57m03s">One of the things they found with mice - I
hope it’s mice - is that mice will not mate</a>
00:57:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h57m09s">- is that right?</a>
00:57:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h57m10s">Okay, I’m gonna garble this up but it doesn't
matter because the underlying point is valid</a>
00:57:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h57m15s">even though I’m gonna mess up the details.</a>
00:57:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h57m18s">Animal studies indicated, if I remembered
correctly, that mice will not mate with other</a>
00:57:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h57m24s">mice who have an RH factor that would increase
the probability of a miscarriage.</a>
00:57:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h57m30s">And neither will women, well not with mice
obviously, but women do not like the smell</a>
00:57:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h57m37s">of men who have RH factors that in combination
with theirs will produce suboptimal offspring,</a>
00:57:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h57m44s">and when you ask them why they don't like
the smell, they say that it’s like my brother.</a>
00:57:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h57m50s">Something like that.</a>
00:57:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h57m51s">So anyways, that’s quite remarkable.</a>
00:57:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h57m55s">Now back to the rats and the expectancy model.</a>
00:57:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h58m00s">We already know that you can get an orienting
response out of a human being if something</a>
00:58:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h58m06s">deviates from expectancy.</a>
00:58:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h58m07s">Now people started studying this in rats,
and the original conceptualization was expectation.</a>
00:58:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h58m13s">So you have an expectation about how the world
is gonna lay itself out.</a>
00:58:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h58m17s">That’s your model, and then if the world
deviates from that, you have an orienting</a>
00:58:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h58m22s">reflex and what that does is protect you from
predation.</a>
00:58:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h58m27s">That’s the first level of the orienting
response.</a>
00:58:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h58m30s">It’s really, really primitive.</a>
00:58:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h58m31s">It’s mediated only by a few neuronal connections
so it’s unbelievably rapid.</a>
00:58:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h58m36s">Then after that, there’s anxiety and the
proclivity to explore.</a>
00:58:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h58m41s">That both gets activated.</a>
00:58:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h58m42s">So it’s first protective, then you orient
towards the - imagine you're walking down</a>
00:58:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h58m50s">the street and hear a really loud noise behind
you.</a>
00:58:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h58m52s">It’s like really loud, so it startles you.</a>
00:58:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h58m54s">Well you go into a crouch so that if a tiger
had jumped on your back, it would be hard</a>
00:58:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h58m59s">for it to get your neck, and then tenths of
a second later, you'll turn assuming you don't</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h59m06s">get attacked by a tiger, you’ll swivel and
turn and orient all your senses towards the</a>
00:59:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h59m11s">locale that was specified by the sound because
you have a stereo auditory system and you</a>
00:59:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h59m18s">can localize events in space using that.</a>
00:59:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h59m21s">So you orient towards it - that’s part of
the orienting reflex.</a>
00:59:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h59m23s">It’s a reflex.</a>
00:59:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h59m25s">It’s not voluntary.</a>
00:59:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h59m26s">So, and then once you've got your eyes trained
on it, and your ears, then you start to explore</a>
00:59:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h59m32s">it and then you might freeze.</a>
00:59:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h59m36s">You might get out of there which is a panic
response.</a>
00:59:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h59m39s">That’s another thing that could be triggered
by the orienting reflex.</a>
00:59:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h59m42s">Different circuit.</a>
00:59:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h59m43s">Or you might think, “Wow, what’s going
on over there?</a>
00:59:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h59m45s">It looks interesting.”</a>
00:59:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h59m46s">And then you go approach it.</a>
00:59:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h59m48s">Now, those two - the exploratory part is mediated
in part by the hypothalamus which is a very</a>
00:59:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=00h59m55s">very old system, and it has a whole section,
about half of it is devoted to the circuitry</a>
00:59:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h00m01s">that you would use to figure out what was
going on if something that you didn't understood</a>
01:00:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h00m05s">happened.</a>
01:00:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h00m06s">And then you have a whole other circuit that’s
hippocampal and amygdalic that regulates the</a>
01:00:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h00m10s">exploratory circuit and says be careful because
while you're gathering information, you might</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h00m14s">get killed and the anxiety circuit takes primacy,
generally speaking, over the exploratory circuit.</a>
01:00:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h00m21s">And the reason for that is you don't want
to get information and be dead so caution</a>
01:00:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h00m26s">is the watchword.</a>
01:00:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h00m28s">Now, the other thing you might think about
which is an extremely useful thing to think</a>
01:00:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h00m32s">about.</a>
01:00:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h00m33s">Okay let’s go back to that diagram I showed
you with the hierarchy.</a>
01:00:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h00m36s">Right, so you’ve got the motor actions at
the bottom, and you've got the high level</a>
01:00:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h00m41s">abstractions at the top.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h00m43s">So, you're tickling the baby and somebody
comes home and says if you tickle the baby</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h00m48s">this way, the baby has more fun.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h00m51s">And so how do you respond to that?</a>
01:00:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h00m53s">Well maybe you’re a little peeved because
you're doing perfectly fine with this baby</a>
01:00:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h00m56s">and someone’s coming and altering your tickling

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h01m13s">There’ll be a tinge of negative emotion
there, generally speaking, depending on how</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h01m25s">Okay, so that’s gonna produce only a little
bit of anxiety and irritation and the reason</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h02m16s">is that?</a>
01:02:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h02m17s">Well it’s like, it’s assault basically.</a>
01:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h02m21s">The only thing you can do in a situation like
that is walk away, ignore it, respond in kind,</a>
01:02:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h02m28s">or it degenerates into violence.</a>
01:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h02m30s">That’s it because there's no discussion.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h02m39s">worse than that, all the mechanisms that we
could use to correct it won’t work.</a>
01:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h02m44s">So, those are fighting words.</a>
01:02:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h02m46s">So don’t do that unless you want to have
a fight.</a>
01:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h02m49s">So then you might say, well what would you
do instead?</a>
01:02:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h02m51s">And the answer is deliver the least amount
of information you possibly can, and so let’s</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h03m09s">You should say, I have this peculiarity and
that is when I come home, I don't have enough</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h03m19s">I would like you to come and say - just shut
the TV off for two minutes, come to the front</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h03m28s">Would it be okay if you did that?</a>
01:03:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h03m30s">And they'll think, “Okay you’ll have to
pay for it somehow,” but then they'll probably</a>
01:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h03m36s">do it.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h03m37s">But the thing is you’ve got to specify the
routine that you want transformed at the highest</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h03m48s">that will satisfy you.</a>
01:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h03m50s">So you can't say, “If you love me, you'd

01:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h03m56s">Ha.</a>
01:03:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h03m57s">Not helpful because they're stupid.</a>
01:03:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h03m58s">Right, and so are you.</a>
01:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h04m01s">So you have to spell it out.</a>
01:04:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h04m03s">It’s like what do you want.</a>
01:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h04m04s">Exactly, what would make you satisfied, and
then you have to have your person grudgingly</a>
01:04:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h04m09s">practice that a few times and you have to
let them do it very badly and also in a bad</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h04m15s">temper, and then you'd have to reward them
for it and then maybe three months later,</a>
01:04:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h04m19s">they'll do it properly.</a>
01:04:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h04m21s">So you need to know that because that's what
people are like.</a>
01:04:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h04m24s">It’s very hard for them to learn new things,
and they're very resistant to it, but they're</a>
01:04:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h04m27s">very responsive to reward.</a>
01:04:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h04m30s">So another thing - this is partly what B.F.
Skinner figured out so, when he was training</a>
01:04:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h04m35s">rats and he wanted a rat to do something,
one of the things he would do is put - maybe</a>
01:04:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h04m39s">he was gonna train the rat to climb up a little
ladder, and I mean he can get rats to climb</a>
01:04:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h04m45s">ladders and climb across the little monkey
bars and then spin around three times and</a>
01:04:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h04m49s">then, you know, whack a ball and then eat
something, like he got incredibly complex</a>
01:04:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h04m53s">behavior out of rats.</a>
01:04:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h04m55s">And the way he did that was patience.</a>
01:04:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h04m58s">So he put the ladder in the cage, and the
rat would just run around doing rat things,</a>
01:04:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h05m02s">and it would put its hand on the first rung,
and Skinner would give it a pellet, and so</a>
01:05:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h05m10s">after even once, the rat’s gonna be like
standing in the immediate vicinity of the</a>
01:05:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h05m16s">ladder and then the frequency with which its
gonna go like this has just increased so its</a>
01:05:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h05m20s">gonna do it again.</a>
01:05:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h05m21s">Bang, pellet.</a>
01:05:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h05m22s">Well soon the rat’s just going like this,
right?</a>
01:05:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h05m25s">So then, you wait until the rat tries the
other hand.</a>
01:05:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h05m28s">So you give it a pellet then.</a>
01:05:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h05m29s">Well then it’s going like this and then
because it’s going to get bored, it’ll</a>
01:05:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h05m33s">go like this.</a>
01:05:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h05m34s">It’ll hit the next stair.</a>
01:05:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h05m35s">Bang, you give it a pellet.</a>
01:05:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h05m36s">Soon the rat is climbing and doing all the
little things he wanted to do.</a>
01:05:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h05m39s">Now the problem with that is you have to be
patient.</a>
01:05:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h05m42s">You have to wait until the rat does what you
want.</a>
01:05:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h05m44s">Okay that’s more relationship advice.</a>
01:05:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h05m46s">Wait till the rat does what you want, and
then reward it, and it’s unbelievably useful.</a>
01:05:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h05m53s">It’s also extraordinarily positive.</a>
01:05:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h05m55s">I mean I’m being, you know, comical, insofar
as I can manage that, about the situation,</a>
01:05:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h06m02s">but people love reward and they love attention.</a>
01:06:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h06m07s">People love attention more than anything else,
and so if you watch through the day, and when</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h06m17s">like that.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h06m18s">You can be inventive, and then they'll do
it more, and if you do that a whole bunch</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h06m22s">like for a year, they'll be doing things that
are good for you just all the time.</a>
01:06:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h06m27s">But you have to be patient, which is very
annoying and you have to suppress your response</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h06m33s">to only respond to negative things, you know,
because what we know about the expectancy</a>

produces a burst of negative emotion.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h06m46s">So you come home, and the whole house is clean,
but there’s like - I don’t know - the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h07m02s">And they're gonna say, “Good luck getting

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h07m06s">And you know, because the thing is the exception

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h07m12s">the reason for that is you can just ignore

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h07m16s">So it just gets invisible really quickly.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h07m19s">So you really gotta watch that tendency.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h07m22s">One of the things Nietzsche said was that

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h12m34s">Okay, so back to the diagram here.</a>

01:12:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h12m42s">So, the early models of expectation were cognitive
models and the idea was the rat makes a little</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h12m49s">model of the world, and then he operates in

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h12m57s">The first is now we know that animals don't
make comprehensive models of the world, and</a>
01:12:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h13m01s">that's a huge problem.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h13m03s">The problem is, well what do they get rid
of, and how?</a>
01:13:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h13m05s">But the way you get rid of that problem is
that you introduce motivation into the equation,</a>
01:13:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h13m10s">and it’s interesting because the behaviorists
always thought of animals like blank slates</a>
01:13:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h13m15s">so they never really took motivation seriously
as a contributor to cognitive modeling.</a>
01:13:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h13m20s">It’s also the case that probably ever since

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h13m30s">So you know, you're as rational insofar as
you didn't let your emotions and motivations</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h13m38s">There are times when it’s inappropriate

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h13m56s">You have to have a reason to think of them,
and the reason is that, well, all the time</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h13m59s">you're operating in some sort of motivational

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h14m04s">using the same kind of hierarchy that we use
to model the personality as such.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h14m10s">I’ll give you an example.</a>
01:14:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h14m16s">So let’s think of some basic motivations
and emotions.</a>
01:14:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h14m21s">Those aren't good categories by the way because
there's no such things as motivations and</a>
01:14:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h14m25s">there's no such thing as emotions.</a>
01:14:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h14m27s">The things we loosely categorize into motivations
and emotions each have their own brain circuitry,</a>
01:14:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h14m33s">and so there are similarities between them
and there are differences.</a>
01:14:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h14m37s">They're not clean categories.</a>
01:14:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h14m38s">Well, we’re gonna use the terminology anyways
because we don't have a better one.</a>
01:14:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h14m42s">For my purposes, you can roughly define a
motivation as opposed to an emotion as a motivation</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h14m50s">is really something that establishes, you
could say, a goal, but it doesn’t.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h15m00s">So what it does is let’s say you're hungry
and it’s nighttime, and you want to have</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h15m12s">It’s not usually quite specific.</a>
01:15:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h15m14s">It’s that there's something you would like

01:15:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h15m16s">So you think, “Ah, I could really use some

01:15:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h15m19s">So you're typing away and the stupid popcorn
thing keeps popping up, and finally your whole</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h15m30s">So what's happened is that your hypothalamus,
roughly speaking, is monitoring your internal</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h22m54s">and that's a staggeringly interesting comment
because you think well, is wanting a positive</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h23m00s">Well you don't have it, so that's kind of

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h23m10s">So one of the things, one of the ways people
have figured out how to deal with that is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h23m13s">they decide they want something that they

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h23m24s">Okay, so Pinocchio is about a puppet, a marionette.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h23m27s">So that means someone else is pulling his

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h23m46s">So there’s one scene in the Disney movie

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6TVYqdN-E#t=01h24m07s">reveals the archetype behind and just closes
back down pulling Pinocchio’s strings.</a>
