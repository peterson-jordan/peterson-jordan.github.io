00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h00m04s">And Jung had this idea, that you had a potential, future self,</a>
00:00:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h00m08s">which would be, in potential, everything that you could be.</a>
00:00:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h00m12s">And that it manifests itself - moment to moment, in your present life - by making you interested in things.</a>
00:00:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h00m19s">And the things that you're interested in, are the things that would guide you along the path, that would lead you to maximal development.</a>
00:00:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h00m26s">Now, it sounds like a metaphysical idea, or a mystical idea even, but it's not.</a>
00:00:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h00m33s">It's not, it's a really profoundly biological idea.</a>
00:00:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h00m36s">The idea is something like:</a>
00:00:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h00m37s">"Well, you're set up so that you're automatically interested in those things, that would fully expand you as a well-adapted creature".</a>
00:00:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h00m45s">Well, like... there's nothing radical about that idea.</a>
00:00:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h00m49s">How el- what else could possibly be the case?</a>
00:00:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h00m51s">Unless there's something fundamentally flawed about you, that is what the situation would be.</a>
00:00:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h00m57s">It's kinda interesting to think, about how that would be manifested moment to moment, but the idea is something like:</a>
00:00:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h01m03s">"Well, your interest is captured by those things that lead you down the path of development".</a>
00:01:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h01m08s">Well, that better be the case.
Okay, so that's fine.</a>
00:01:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h01m11s">And so, there's some utility in pursuing those things, that you're interested in.</a>
00:01:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h01m14s">That's the call to adventure, let's say.</a>
00:01:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h01m17s">So... and the call to adventure takes you all sorts of places.</a>
00:01:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h01m20s">Now, the problem with the call to adventure is - like, what the hell do you know?</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h01m24s">You might be interested in things, that are kinda warped and bent.</a>
00:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h01m28s">And often it's the case, that when new parts of people manifest themselves,</a>
00:01:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h01m33s">and grip their interest, say, they do it very badly and shoddily.</a>
00:01:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h01m38s">And so, you stumble around like an idiot, when you try to do something new.</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h01m41s">That's why the fool is the precursor to the Savior, from the... from the symbolic perspective.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h01m46s">It's cause you have to be a fool,
before you can be a master,</a>
00:01:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h01m49s">and if you're not willing to be a fool,

and that's also laid out in the Old Testament stories,</a>
00:01:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h01m59s">because the first thing that happens to all these patriarchal figures,</a>

And some of it's social, and some of it's natural,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h02m12s">some of it's a consequence of their moral inadequacy.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h02m16s">And, but- but-</a>
00:02:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h02m18s">the thing that's so interesting, is that despite the fact that they're fools, they're still supposed to go on the adventure,</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h02m23s">and that they're capable of learning enough, as a consequence of moving forward on the adventure,</a>

00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h02m33s">this circumambulation, that Jung talked about, was this</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h02m36s">continual - we'll return to this - this continual circling, in some sense, of who you could be.</a>
00:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h02m42s">You might notice, for example, that there are themes in your life, you know,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h02m45s">when you go back across your experiences, you see- you kind of have your typical experience, that sort of repeats itself.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h02m52s">There might be variation on it, like a musical theme, but it's- it's like...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h03m01s">That's the circumambulation.
Now, remember that for a sec, because we'll go back to it.</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h03m05s">Okay, so imagine that something glimmers before you,</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h03m08s">it's an- an interest that's dawning, and you decide-</a>
00:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h03m11s">well first of all, you're paralyzed, you think:</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h03m13s">"Well, how do I know if I should pursue that?

00:03:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h03m16s">And the proper response to that is:</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h03m18s">You're right, it probably is a stupid idea,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h03m25s">The probability that - as you move forward on your adventure - that you're gonna get it right, the first time, is zero.</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h03m31s">It's just not gonna happen.</a>
00:03:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h03m33s">And so, then you might think: "Well, maybe I'll just wait around, until I get the right idea".</a>
00:03:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h03m38s">And which people do, right? So they're like 40-year-old thirteen year olds, which is not a good idea.</a>
00:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h03m43s">And so, they wait around until-

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h03m48s">but the problem is - you're too stupid to know when you've got it right,</a>

00:06:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h06m35s">So it's like this:</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h07m06s">this guy uh, [who] set up a really advanced computational recording system in his home,</a>
00:07:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h07m11s">and recorded every single utterance his young child made, while learning to speak.</a>
00:07:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h07m17s">And then, he put together the child's attempts to say certain phonemes.</a>
00:07:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h07m22s">And - put them in the list - and you can hear the child deviating madly to begin with,</a>
00:07:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h07m27s">and then, after hundreds and hundreds of repetitions,
just zeroing right in on the exact phoneme.</a>
00:07:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h07m33s">So, you know, I-

00:07:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h07m38s">they babble every human phoneme.</a>
00:07:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h07m41s">Including all sorts of phonemes that adults can't say.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h07m44s">And then they... they "die" into their language.</a>
00:07:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h07m47s">So that after they learn, say, English,</a>
00:07:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h07m50s">then there's all sorts of phonemes they can no longer hear or pronounce.</a>
00:07:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h07m53s">But to begin with, it's all there,
which is really quite interesting.</a>
00:07:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h07m56s">But so, they z-

00:07:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h08m00s">they zero in on the proper way to pronounce that, and their errors minimize.</a>
00:08:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h08m05s">And every time you learn something, that's how it is.</a>
00:08:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h08m07s">And that's really useful to know, too - because it means, that it's okay to wander around stupidly,</a>
00:08:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h08m12s">before you fix your destination.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h08m15s">Now, you see that echoed in Exodus, right?</a>
00:08:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h08m17s">Because what happens, is that the Egyptians or the Hebrews escaped a tyranny,</a>
00:08:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h08m22s">which is kind of whatever you do, personally and psychologically,</a>
00:08:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h08m26s">when you escape, from your previous set of stupidly held, and ignorant, and stubborn axioms.</a>
00:08:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h08m32s">It's like - away from that tyranny.
It's like: "Great, I freed myself from that".</a>
00:08:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h08m36s">Well, then what?</a>
00:08:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h08m37s">Well, you think "well, now I'm on the way".
It's- No you're not, now you're in the desert!</a>
00:08:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h08m41s">Where you wander around stupidly, you know,
and worship the wrong things,</a>
00:08:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h08m46s">until you finally organize yourself morally again,
and head in the proper direction.</a>
00:08:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h08m50s">So that's worth knowing too, because you think:</a>
00:08:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h08m54s">"Well, I got rid of a lot of things... baggage, excess baggage,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h09m16s">And- and that's... well, that's exactly why Exodus is structured the way that it is.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h09m19s">It's that - you escaped from a tyranny.
It's "Hurray! We're no longer slaves."</a>

doesn't mean that you can't learn!</a>
00:11:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h11m16s">And so, you can posit an ideal,
and you're gonna be wrong about it,</a>
00:11:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h11m19s">but it doesn't matter - because what you're right about,
is positing the ideal [and] moving towards it.</a>
00:11:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h11m24s">If- if actual ideal isn't-
conceptualized perfectly...</a>
00:11:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h11m29s">Well, first off - surprise surprise, cause like, what are you gonna do that's perfect?</a>
00:11:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h11m33s">So...</a>
00:11:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h11m34s">It doesn't matter that it's imperf- imperfect.</a>
00:11:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h11m36s">It just matters that you do it, and that you move forward.</a>
00:11:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h11m39s">So, that's really- that's really positive news, as far as I'm concerned,</a>
00:11:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h11m42s">because you can actually do that, right?
You can do it badly.</a>
00:11:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h11m45s">Anyone can do that.
So that's... that's useful.</a>
00:11:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h11m49s">Okay, so like, if you're an efficient person, you would have just done that.</a>
00:11:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h11m53s">But, you're not. But who cares, you know?</a>
00:11:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h11m55s">You still end up in the... in the same place.</a>
00:11:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc#t=00h11m58s">And maybe the trip is even more interesting.
Who knows? Probably too interesting.</a>
