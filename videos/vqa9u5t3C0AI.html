00:00:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h00m08s">I'm going to tell you the story behind the self authoring Suite Website.</a>
00:00:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h00m13s">A few years ago, I realized that the students in my classes had written essays on all sorts of subjects in grade school and college</a>
00:00:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h00m20s">However, they'd never been asked to write thoughtfully about themselves about their own past experiences</a>
00:00:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h00m27s">personalities and visions for their futures.</a>
00:00:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h00m30s">Upon reflection</a>
00:00:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h00m31s">This lack of opportunity struck me as strange to say the least</a>
00:00:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h00m35s">Since there's nothing more important to get straight than your own personal experience.</a>
00:00:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h00m41s">At the same time I was speaking with managers at various companies about how to hire more effective workers</a>
00:00:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h00m47s">They were much more interested in how to improve the performance of poorly performing people they had already hired.</a>
00:00:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h00m54s">I didn't have much to tell them at the time because improving people is very difficult. Nonetheless the two problems stuck in my mind.</a>
00:00:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h01m04s">So I started to search for psychological interventions that could be used widely and practically to clarify and improve people's lives.</a>
00:01:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h01m13s">I already knew that people lived inside the stories they told about themselves and that they used those stories to interpret everything around them.</a>
00:01:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h01m21s">While considering this I came upon, Dr. James Pennebaker's research</a>
00:01:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h01m26s">conducted at the University of Texas at Austin.</a>
00:01:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h01m29s">Dr. Pennebaker tested Sigmund Freud's theory that the release of emotions related to traumatic events could be curative.</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h01m37s">He had his students write for three days for 15 minutes a day about the most upsetting experiences of their lives</a>
00:01:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h01m44s">while a control group wrote about ordinary daily activities.</a>
00:01:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h01m49s">Those in the former group experienced long-term improvements in their psychological and physical health after a brief dip in mood</a>
00:01:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h01m57s">Not so much because of the expression of pent-up feelings however</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h02m01s">But because they drew more specific causal conclusions</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h02m04s">About what had happened to them in the past.</a>
00:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h02m07s">Dr. Laura King had her subjects write about their ideals and future goals instead, but they experienced the same benefits.</a>
00:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h02m15s">Our research team specifically tested the effects of the future authoring program part of the self authoring suite related to goal setting</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h02m22s">at McGill University in Montreal Canada and Erasmus University in Rotterdam, Holland.</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h02m29s">Academically struggling McGill students increased their grades by</a>

00:02:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h02m40s">the same thing happened at Erasmus University</a>
00:02:40</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h02m46s">These effects do not just apply to students either</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h02m49s">Dr. Frank Schmidt, one of the world's outstanding industrial psychologists, has demonstrated that participating in such programs</a>
00:02:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h02m57s">Makes all kinds of people substantially more effective or whatever they are doing</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h03m03s">People who complete such programs appear to benefit because the careful articulation of their experiences, past, present and future</a>
00:03:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h03m12s">decreases misery related to threat and uncertainty and</a>

00:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h03m23s">When complicated experiences are carefully put into words the manner in which they are represented in the brain changes</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h03m30s">They move from the areas associated with stressful emotion demanding constant physical readiness</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h03m36s">To the areas associated with detailed comprehension and understanding</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h03m41s">This makes articulate people less stressed and more</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h04m15s">Each of the programs is composed of a series of interactive web pages that present you with specific personal questions</a>
00:04:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h04m22s">This simplifies and guides the difficult process of personal writing</a>
00:04:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h04m27s">Each program requires careful thought and takes several hours to complete</a>
00:04:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h04m32s">It is better to write over a number of days so that you have time to think and because sleep aids the process</a>
00:04:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h04m40s">The writing is challenging, but the experimentally documented benefits are worth it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9u5t3C0AI#t=00h04m47s">The past authoring program helps you write an autobiography. It will present you with pages like this introducing you to the program</a>
