00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h00m03s">that the judge and the savior are the same person.</a>
00:00:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h00m07s">Well you know in the Book of Revelation you know this or you don't know</a>
00:00:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h00m10s">Christ is coming back as judge and he has a sword coming-</a>
00:00:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h00m15s">it's a revealing vision, that book, it's very strange.</a>
00:00:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h00m20s">It is the last thing conservative Christians would expect to believe.</a>
00:00:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h00m23s">And believe me, it's such a visionary hallucination, the Book of Revelation.</a>
00:00:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h00m28s">But Christ returns with a sword that comes out of his mouth and he comes back as a judge.</a>
00:00:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h00m33s">He divides the cursed from the redeemed.</a>
00:00:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h00m35s">And most of them are cursed, some are redeemed. It's very gross.</a>
00:00:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h00m39s">Jung believed that the figure of Christ in the Gospels was too pleasing, too merciful,</a>
00:00:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h00m45s">turned too much to grace, and that referred to an opposing force.</a>
00:00:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h00m49s">And that was the opposing force of judgment. A very interesting hypothesis.</a>
00:00:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h00m53s">But then there is the fusion of the two ideas,</a>
00:00:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h00m57s">That the judge and the savior are the same person.</a>
00:00:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h01m00s">Okay well</a>
00:01:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h01m02s">A young man told me his life was short of</a>
00:01:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h01m06s">purpose and aim and meaning and that he was nihilistic.</a>
00:01:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h01m10s">Before he started - he'd read the Zen in the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h01m15s">which is a book that I actually really like.</a>
00:01:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h01m17s">I've read it three times in three different decades of my life.</a>
00:01:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h01m19s">And one of the things that is very interesting about the book is that</a>
00:01:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h01m22s">it is an examination of the idea of ​​quality, the idea that there is</a>
00:01:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h01m26s">qualitative differences are between things and that we have the instinct to create qualitative differences.</a>
00:01:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h01m32s">And so a qualitative difference is just "This is better than that",</a>
00:01:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h01m37s">that's a judgment.</a>
00:01:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h01m38s">Okay, well what Ratzinger suggested is that the person</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h01m45s">You know what the modern idea is that you just have to accept yourself.</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h01m49s">-I think that's a crazy idea, by the way.</a>
00:01:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h01m51s">Really, I couldn't come up with a more nihilistic idea with "You're okay already!"</a>
00:01:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h01m56s">Because, no, you are not!</a>
00:01:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h01m58s">And the reason you are not 'okay' is that you can be so much more than you are!</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h02m01s">So what do you want to be?</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h02m02s">Do you want to stay as you are or do you want to work towards a better version of yourself?</a>
00:02:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h02m07s">And this young man, an Australian, he said the reason that "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"</a>
00:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h02m12s">such an impact on him was because he was unhappy with his current state of well-being.</a>
00:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h02m18s">And he didn't think the way he expressed himself was wrong.</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h02m23s">And the fact that</a>
00:02:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h02m25s">the author of "Zen", that was Pirsig, had commented that you could make qualitative differences.</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h02m31s">And that there is really a difference between good things, bad things, good things and evil things.</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h02m36s">It gives you direction.</a>
00:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h02m38s">It gives you the opportunity to move up.</a>
00:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h02m42s">And Ratzinger noted that at least some amount</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h02m46s">people are not satisfied with themselves and they have to move up.</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h02m50s">And so they have to conceptualize something of the highest form of 'good' and then they have to strive for it.</a>
00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h02m55s">And the thing is there is no difference between conceptualizing the good and being judged,</a>
00:02:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h03m03s">because if you start conceptualizing the good and strive for it,</a>
00:03:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h03m06s">what you have to do is separate yourself from all the things that are not right and leave them behind.</a>
00:03:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h03m12s">And that's why the savior and the judge are the same thing.</a>
00:03:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h03m15s">And one of them is very attractive.</a>
00:03:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h03m17s">I think about the modern world that we reject the existence of qualitative differences.</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h03m23s">You say, "Well, we don't want to hurt anyone's feelings by saying one is better than the other."</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h03m28s">And okay, that's fair, it's no fun being thrown off with the cursed, that's guaranteed.</a>
00:03:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h03m34s">But if people are not satisfied with their current state,</a>
00:03:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h03m40s">which turns out to be the case, try to find someone who isn't.</a>
00:03:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h03m44s">And if you deny that the possibility of qualitative differences because you promote radical egalitarianism,</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h03m52s">then you also promote the chance of redemption because there is no pursuit of the good.</a>
00:03:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h03m56s">And it seems to me it's catastrophic to sacrifice the good for</a>
00:03:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h04m02s">Well, it is catastrophic to sacrifice the good for the equal.</a>
00:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h04m06s">'Cause if we were all equal</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h04m09s">we would all be equally undelivered and miserable.</a>
00:04:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFbWTEZx_w#t=00h04m13s">And thus..</a>
