00:00:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h00m17s">and then I am going to walk through as I mentioned, I am going to walk through</a>
00:00:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h00m22s">the Disney movie film Pinnochio and which I presume most of you have seen</a>
00:00:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h00m26s">How many of you have seen it?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h00m28s">Yeah, OK, that's, that's...so as I think I mentioned that is something in of itself right?</a>
00:00:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h00m34s">I mean the fact that you have all seen it means that it's an</a>
00:00:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h00m37s">production of cultural significance, and because it's such a strange artifact</a>
00:00:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h00m41s">That's one way of looking at it, it might be worth</a>
00:00:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h00m45s">trying to take it apart to understand why it is, for example, that you even understand it.</a>
00:00:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h00m50s">and so,</a>
00:00:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h00m52s">I offered you the proposition last week that we</a>
00:00:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h00m55s">view the world as essentially through a narrative lens</a>
00:00:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h00m58s">and I believe that we view the world through a narrative lens</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h01m02s">because the fundamental problem that we have to solve</a>
00:01:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h01m05s">as living creatures is how we should act in the world.</a>
00:01:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h01m08s">and,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h01m09s">that means,</a>
00:01:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h01m11s">how we should act to maintain ourselves</a>
00:01:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h01m13s">but also how we need to act in relationship to other people</a>
00:01:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h01m17s">and in relationship to the broader world in order to maintain our self across time.</a>
00:01:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h01m23s">so that's a complicated problem, right, it's not just how you survive</a>
00:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h01m27s">it's how you survive now and next week, and next month, and next year</a>
00:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h01m33s">and 50 years from now and maybe your,  your descendants as well</a>
00:01:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h01m37s">if the culture is going to stabilize</a>
00:01:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h01m38s">and then not only you across all those time frames but you and everyone else across all those time frames</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h01m44s">It's a viciously difficult problem</a>
00:01:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h01m47s">and so, I would say that we have evolved mechanisms to solve that</a>
00:01:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h01m52s">I think that is self-evident in some sense because for example one of the mechanisms that</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h01m58s">animals have evolved to deal with the problem of social being</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h02m02s">even if they are not particularly social animals</a>
00:02:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h02m05s">is the dominance hierarchy, right, or you could call it hierarchy of authority or power, because</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h02m10s">I think that considering human</a>
00:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h02m13s">structures, social structures as mere power</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h02m17s">structures is a terrible mistake, it's a terrible oversimplification</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h02m23s">because power is no means the only, like force is what I mean</a>
00:02:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h02m28s">force is not a stable way of solving the problem of how to live together across time</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h02m34s">the question is what is the stable way of solving how to live together</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h02m38s">across time, and the really is the question and it's part of the question that</a>
00:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h02m42s">I am trying to answer</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h02m45s">partly because it's a perennial problem, right, we face the problem of</a>
00:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h02m50s">how to organize ourselves in small social units</a>
00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h02m53s">without undue conflict and then we face the larger problem</a>
00:02:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h02m56s">of how to organize ourselves into large social units without undue conflict and that conflict can be</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h03m03s">absolutely devastating, and, and frequently is</a>
00:03:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h03m07s">so,</a>
00:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h03m08s">so then I would also say that the first way of solving this problem isn't conscious</a>
00:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h03m14s">you see, not at all</a>
00:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h03m16s">and, you know</a>
00:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h03m17s">you may know, and you may not know that there are</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h03m20s">there are different forms of memory</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h03m23s">right</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h03m23s">really technically different forms of memory, so for example</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h03m27s">there is short term working memory</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h03m30s">which is the memory that you use to hold things like telephone numbers in your active imagination</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h03m36s">it decays very rapidly, it's only 4 to 7 bits</a>
00:03:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h03m39s">which is why</a>
00:03:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h03m40s">well it's why phone numbers are, were at least</a>
00:03:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h03m44s">7 digits long, you know, you can kind of</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h03m48s">manage that as a loop that, and then there is</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h03m53s">episodic memory, and that has two elements one is semantic and the other is episodic</a>
00:03:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h04m01s">it's, what's the name of that</a>
00:04:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h04m05s">mmm, someone said something...</a>
00:04:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h04m09s">[Student] Procedural?</a>
00:04:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h04m10s">Yes well there is procedural memory and then there is another</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h04m13s">the kind of memory that you use to represent your</a>
00:04:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h04m17s">experiences to yourself, so let's say it is image laden and the other one is semantic</a>
00:04:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h04m22s">and semantic is your memory for facts and those are quite different, so for example</a>
00:04:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h04m27s">procedural memory</a>
00:04:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h04m29s">that is how you ride a bike, that is how you play the piano</a>
00:04:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h04m32s">that's how you play jazz music if you are in a combo</a>
00:04:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h04m35s">it's, it's the memory, it's a funny kind of memory because it is built right into you, you know, I mean</a>
00:04:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h04m42s">so is, so is, the kind of memory that you use to represent your own life, but it is much more malleable is some sense</a>
00:04:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h04m49s">so, what that means is that in your procedures</a>
00:04:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h04m53s">there is information that you don't know about, it's patterned information that you don't know about</a>
00:04:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h05m00s">part of that is how to act</a>
00:05:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h05m01s">you know, like, when you walk into a social gathering</a>
00:05:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h05m04s">you don't really think through how you are going to act</a>
00:05:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h05m07s">you know how to act, and if someone asks you</a>
00:05:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h05m10s">exactly what it is that you are doing and why, you could formulate a story about it</a>
00:05:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h05m15s">but the probability that, that it's the existence of that story that enabled you to act that way is zero, because</a>
00:05:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h05m21s">you have to react way faster than that, and so, you know have social knowledge</a>
00:05:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h05m26s">built into your nervous system because you have practiced being a social being for a very long period of time</a>
00:05:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h05m33s">and of course, then that social being has been shaped forever really, it's the right way of thinking about it</a>
00:05:33</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h05m49s">at least since the time of the crustaceans, you know , when we split from out common ancestor 300 million years ago, and so</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h05m56s">and it's true for social animals and non-social animals so</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h06m11s">partly that's, you can hear them having their little dominance disputes in the spring when they are singing because basically what they are singing is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h06m47s">like it is really important where you are positioned in the hierarchy even if you are not</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h08m46s">but because we share a map of the culture, the cultural expectations</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h09m10s">and so, one of the really useful things to understand , and this took me a long time to formulate properly, you know,</a>
00:09:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h09m17s">you hear the terror management theorists for example and they have this idea that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h22m46s">that will respond way before you're conscious</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h22m49s">So, for example</a>
00:22:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h22m49s">if you happened to be walking down a trail and you detect something snake like in the periphery, you will leap away</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h23m00s">and that's because it takes a fair bit of time to actually see a snake</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h23m04s">by which I mean, form a conscious representation of the snake</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h23m08s">you know, and maybe it takes a 1/4 of a second or something like that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h23m11s">or even longer</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h23m13s">but it doesn't matter, maybe it takes a tenth</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h23m16s">a twentieth of a second, a tenth of a second but the thing about the damn snake is that it's way faster than that</a>
00:23:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h23m21s">it's really fast that thing and it co-evolved with primates by the way</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h23m31s">your eyes map snake like objects right onto your reflexes so that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h23m49s">now what I would say that what we do is that we live in a shared story</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h23m53s">and the story is a way of looking at the world and it's a way of acting in the world at the same time</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h23m58s">and that story has to operate within narrow parameters</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h24m05s">because, and this is something I think that Piaget figured out, Jean Piaget</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h24m13s">by the way, one of the things that Piaget was trying to do</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h24m28s">on mollusks which apparently was very good and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h24m31s">so they offered him the curatorship of a museum and his parents wrote back and said, "Well you know,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h39m33s">that's a lot of difference, like a four year old is an adult as far as a two year old is concerned</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h39m39s">and so if the four year old is still acting like a two year old, that's really not good!</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h39m43s">and other four year old's will come up and, you know</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h39m45s">do a little play invitation, like a dog, and you know, the kid, the two year old four year old has no idea how to react to that and so the more mature kid thinks</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h40m00s">from the peers and after four you mostly socialized by your peers</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h40m05s">and so you just fall farther and farther and farther behind</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h40m08s">you are more and more alienated, you are more bitter and angry and no wonder</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h40m17s">so that's useful to know, it's like your job from two to four</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h40m42s">because if they can't amuse themselves they are not going to play with other kids</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h40m47s">they are sorted together enough so if another three year old comes along</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h40m51s">they can at least play in parallel</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h41m04s">and so what the kids will do, sometimes they mediate it verbally</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h47m18s">That's cooperation, well are teams competing against each other</a>
00:47:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h47m22s">Well yes! But they agreed to compete within a particular landscape</a>
00:47:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h47m26s">and they all cooperate to maintain that landscape, and so</a>
00:47:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h47m29s">you do the same thing when you are playing Monopoly</a>
00:47:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h47m32s">It's like you are trying to win but at the same time you are cooperating</a>
00:47:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h47m35s">That's what, that's society man! That's society right there!</a>
00:47:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h47m39s">You are cooperating</a>
00:47:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h47m42s">That's the big enclosure, and within that there are regulated competitions</a>
00:47:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h47m47s">But, to separate those artificially and say one is competition and the other is cooperation is just</a>
00:47:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h47m55s">It's just not. just not very smart, it's not observant, that's not how it workd</a>
00:47:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h48m01s">and games are intensely cooperative even if they are intensely competitive, I mean</a>
00:48:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h48m06s">the  hockey teams are playing in the same game, that's the cooperation, then each team</a>
00:48:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h48m11s">there is competition within the team to be the best player, let's say, but everyone wants that</a>
00:48:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h48m17s">because everyone wants good players to emerge, but still cooperate like mad with your team mates and if you don't pass</a>
00:48:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h48m23s">and you know, play like a reasonable person then, they're going to not be happy with you</a>
00:48:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h48m29s">and so,</a>
00:48:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h48m30s">even within that competition, cooperation is regulating the interactions and then you can think</a>
00:48:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h48m35s">this is a really good thing to think too, it's like</a>
00:48:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h48m38s">People often say to their kids,</a>
00:48:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h48m42s">doesn't matter whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game.</a>
00:48:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h48m45s">and the kid of course has no idea what that means, it's like what do you mean, I am trying to win</a>
00:48:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h48m50s">and the parents says, "No, no, it matters how you play"</a>
00:48:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h48m53s">and the kid pushes them and the parents really can't come up with a good explanation of why that is the case</a>
00:48:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h48m58s">They might say, "Well other kids won't play with you"</a>
00:48:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h49m01s">There you go!</a>
00:49:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h49m02s">Because you could say,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h49m05s">this is something to think about, so</a>
00:49:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h49m09s">there is a game</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h49m10s">and there is a victory within the game</a>
00:49:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h49m13s">but then there is the set of all games</a>
00:49:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h49m15s">and there is victory across the set of all games</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h49m18s">and the victory that you attain across the set of all games</a>
00:49:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h49m22s">isn't winning all the games</a>
00:49:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h49m24s">it's being invited to play all the games</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h49m27s">and so if you play fair</a>
00:49:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h49m29s">then you are playing a meta-game</a>
00:49:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h49m32s">and the meta-game is how to win across the set of all games</a>
00:49:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h49m35s">and so if you teach your child how to behave properly then they always get invited to play</a>
00:49:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h49m40s">and that makes them winners</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h49m42s">and that's that!</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h49m43s">and so if you understand that  you understand something</a>
00:49:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h49m47s">phenomenally important about the emergence of morality</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h49m51s">you know because people, moral relativist in particular think that morality is relative</a>
00:49:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h49m57s">and of course human beings are diverse, just like languages are diverse</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h50m01s">and there is more than one playable game but there is not really more than one playable meta-game</a>
00:50:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h50m07s">it's like you are either the kind of person that other people want to play with</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h50m16s">it's as simple as that, and that's</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h50m18s">true of all cultures, they might be playing different individual games</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h50m25s">the set of all games that they play is still common across cultures, that's part of what makes us human</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h50m32s">and then you could say as well</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h50m34s">we are actually evolved to detect people who are good at playing the set of all possible games</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h50m40s">and we actually know that, that's not theoretical, we know for example</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h50m57s">and so great are detecting cheaters and you remember</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h51m01s">and that's because you can't trust a cheater and you shouldn't invite a cheater to play a game with you because they might cheat!</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h51m07s">and so, that's part of the innate morality system, you remember cheaters because they good at playing the meta-game</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h51m14s">and of course you're evolved</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h54m57s">so, your aiming at some handleable amount of time</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h55m00s">and you posit a goal in there and you plot your route and then,</a>
00:55:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h55m04s">that tells you what is up</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h55m20s">Well it's easy, no goal, no positive emotion.</a>
00:55:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h55m23s">Because you experience positive emotion by noticing that you are moving towards a goal</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h55m29s">and so if you don't have a goal</a>
00:55:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h55m31s">well you can't have any positive emotion! So,</a>
00:55:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h55m34s">you better have a goal, and so you might say well what should the goal be?</a>
00:55:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h55m38s">Well we could start by saying, well, any goal is better than none.</a>
00:55:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h55m42s">And then we might say well it should be a goal that other people</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h55m45s">will let you pursue, because otherwise it's going to be kind of difficult</a>
00:55:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h55m49s">and maybe they will be even happy to help you pursue it, that would even be better</a>
00:55:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h55m53s">and maybe it's a goal that would enable you to learn how to pursue other goals</a>
00:55:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h55m56s">while you pursue that goal, boy, that would really be good,</a>
00:55:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h56m00s">And so, you can see that your goal was parameterized</a>
00:56:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h56m04s">but that doesn't mean that any old goal works, it means there's some goals that work nicely</a>
00:56:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h56m09s">and some not so nicely, there are playable games and non-playable games, that's a good way of thinking about it</a>
00:56:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h56m14s">and you want to have a playable game, and there is a lot of them</a>
00:56:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h56m18s">lawyer, plumber, you know</a>
00:56:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h56m21s">actor, whatever, they are playable games</a>
00:56:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h56m24s">and it's not obvious which one is better but</a>
00:56:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h56m27s">it's certainly obvious which ones are sustainable and which ones are worse</a>
00:56:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h56m31s">and so they're is a set of playable games and you need to extract from that set of playable games</a>
00:56:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h56m36s">a game that suits you.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h56m37s">and that would be partly due to your temperament, you know, because extroverted people want to play an extroverted game</a>
00:56:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h56m43s">highly neurotic people want to play a safe game</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h56m49s">disagreeable people want to play a game that highly competitive so they can win, and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h56m54s">you know, fine!</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h56m55s">but they're all</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h56m57s">within the realm of playable games</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h56m59s">and that means they are socially acceptable as well</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h57m01s">and so, that means, it isn't just</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h57m05s">arbitrary , it isn't just relative</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h57m08s">what you decide to do, it is heavily parameterized, there is only</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h57m12s">there is a set of playable games, and it's large, the set is large but</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h57m17s">there are commonalities within it, and that's why there are commonalties</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h57m28s">what's up, what is up mean?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h57m31s">what does it mean, is there such a thing, now</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h57m34s">one thing to remember is that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h57m36s">if you don't erect a hierarchical structure with something to aim at</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h57m41s">you got no positive motivation</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h57m43s">because, you experience positive motivation in relationship to a goal, not from attaining the goal</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h57m49s">that's satisfaction, besides it's fleeting</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h58m07s">so it's unreliable as a source of positive emotion, but what's reliable is, you set a goal.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h59m09s">they were stellar at that</a>
00:59:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h59m11s">and imaginative, tremendously imaginative, but collectively imaginative</a>
00:59:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h59m16s">and so they put together a collective product</a>
00:59:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h59m19s">and you might say well how did they do that exactly, it's like well</a>
00:59:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h59m22s">they were good storytellers, and what does that mean, well</a>
00:59:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h59m27s">it means you know the story that works and the story that doesn't</a>
00:59:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h59m31s">and maybe partly what you do is you kind of think out a story, and you think, well what is this happened?</a>
00:59:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h59m36s">Well, maybe this should happen?  Oh! That's the thing! That would work!</a>
00:59:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h59m41s">It's like a little flash of inspiration, right it's like</a>
00:59:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h59m43s">you got a piece of the puzzle that fits, you think, That will work there!</a>
00:59:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h59m47s">and then you talk to the other people and you generate ideas and someone says, What if?</a>
00:59:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h59m51s">What if they do this? And then everyone goes, No, no that's just not believable, no ones going to buy that.</a>
00:59:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=00h59m56s">and someone else has a little revelation, they say, Well, you know, it makes some sense somehow if,</a>
00:59:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h00m02s">if they do this! And then everybody goes, Oh yeah! That really</a>
01:00:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h00m05s">that really works!</a>
01:00:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h00m07s">It's like, why?</a>
01:00:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h00m08s">Why? why?</a>
01:00:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h00m10s">Well you don't know, you don't know why it works</a>
01:00:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h00m13s">but it works because</a>
01:00:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h00m15s">It works because it's the right story</a>
01:00:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h00m18s">and so what does that mean?</a>
01:00:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h00m20s">well it's kind of associated with this meta-game idea</a>
01:00:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h00m24s">you know, there is a story that you should be acting out that works across games</a>
01:00:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h00m28s">and you have an inkling of it, you have notion of it, you have a vague apprehension of it</a>
01:00:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h00m32s">it's sort of built into you, that's an archetype, that's an archetype</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h00m35s">and so when you read a story that works you are just entranced by it, and you all know that</a>
01:00:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h00m41s">You go to a movie and it's a great movie and you are just blown away, you know it's</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h00m45s">a movie can pull you in</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h00m47s">and turn you into one of the screen characters and, like, run you through a huge set of emotions.</a>
01:00:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h00m52s">I saw this movie once about</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h01m02s">the totalitarian death squads and he couldn't remember anything about himself, and</a>
01:01:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h01m07s">he went back to his village and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h01m10s">basically what happened was that, he ended up back in the totalitarian</a>
01:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h01m15s">death grip.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h01m17s">and it showed how the fascist state</a>
01:01:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h01m20s">had saturated the village completely, and,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h01m23s">so it was a tragedy and you could see with every action that</a>
01:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h01m27s">this amnestic guy as he recreated himself and remembered his identity</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h01m32s">was going to travel down exactly the same road because nothing had changed</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h01m36s">and by the time, I wish, I have looked what that movie was for years, I've never been able to find it again</a>
01:01:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h01m43s">but, when the movie was over every single person in the theater was crying</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h01m48s">and not just a little bit, they were just out of it, it was brilliant</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h01m52s">terrifying movie</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h01m57s">and it got people, and you you might say</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h02m00s">you know you have dim apprehensions about the world</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h02m03s">and some of those are instinctual, and some of those are a consequence of your</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h02m25s">and that produces that overwhelming emotion, and then, and that partly how you make yourself</a>
01:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h02m30s">transparent to yourself</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h02m40s">My nephew, had a dream at one point</a>
01:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h02m45s">someone made a little animated thing out of it and put it on the Internet which is quite cool</a>
01:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h02m50s">So anyways, he was having night terrors and he ran around like a little knight</a>
01:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h02m56s">you know, k-n-i-g-h-t, knight and he had a little</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h03m00s">you know, armor and a sword and he would run around the house</a>
01:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h03m04s">with a little knight hat on, being a knight</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h03m07s">and he was only like four or something and he had watched a lot of Disney movies</a>
01:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h03m10s">a lot of movies, so he kind of got the knight idea, it was</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h03m14s">He was acting that out and he was having terrors at night, right</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h03m18s">and so he would go to bed with his little knight hat and his sword and he would put them on his bed, and then</a>
01:03:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h03m23s">at night he would wake up screaming, and that happened for a very long time, and so</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h03m26s">when I went to visit, you know, I found out that this was happening and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h03m30s">he had night terror, so the kid wakes up with night terrors</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h03m34s">screaming but can't remember anything generally speaking, so</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h03m45s">said, "Did you have a dream?" and he said "Oh yes, I had a dream"</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h08m42s">or Star Wars for that matter, mostly Star Trek, it's like</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h08m56s">there is a wild savage landscape out there that can be conquered by and settled and stabilized by civilization</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h09m21s">and if you take both of those  stories, even though they are exactly the opposite to one another</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h17m43s">Instinctual images and say, well, what do they mean? What do they mean? What do they mean?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h18m04s">Because a picture presents everything at once</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h18m22s">Well that's a partial answer, and it's a culture bound answer, obviously</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h18m27s">But you see archetypal representations like this in many cultures, so for example</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h19m29s">So,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h19m31s">I told you about this a little bit last week, but, you know, one of the motivations I had for</a>
01:19:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h19m37s">thinking about the things that I have thought through</a>
01:19:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h19m40s">the motivation I had for thinking them through was because</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h19m45s">Well, I</a>
01:19:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h19m48s">It seemed self-evident to me, let's say</a>
01:19:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h19m51s">and I think that it was partly from reading Jung, but that just helped me clarify it, was that</a>
01:19:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h19m57s">You know it was sort of Jung's contention that</a>
01:19:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h20m01s">We had an organic development of a metaphysical ethic</a>
01:20:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h20m07s">that was embedded in, in religious tradition</a>
01:20:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h20m10s">and that basically unfolded let's say in the West until about 1600, 1500, something like that, and then</a>
01:20:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h20m16s">science emerged and we got unbelievably technologically powerful</a>
01:20:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h20m21s">using a certain view of the world</a>
01:20:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h20m24s">you know, we are so technologically powerful</a>
01:20:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h20m26s">but, we are still not very wise</a>
01:20:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h20m29s">and that just seem to me to be a bad combination</a>
01:20:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h20m32s">and, I thought about that a lot, it's like, OK, how do you handle the combination of</a>
01:20:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h20m37s">exceptional technological power and</a>
01:20:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h20m39s">and an impaired ethic, let's say</a>
01:20:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h20m41s">something like that, underdeveloped ethic or one in even which you have no faith, because</a>
01:20:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h20m46s">you know, it seems, the foundational elements of it are irrational, they're in mythology</a>
01:20:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h20m52s">they're in religion, they don't fit well with the scientific world view</a>
01:20:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h20m56s">How do you rectify that problem? And</a>
01:20:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h20m59s">Well that's a tough problem, you know, it's a crazy problem</a>
01:20:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h21m02s">and certainly it was the problem that Jung was trying to address, there is no doubt about it</a>
01:21:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h21m06s">Along with that went an associated problem which was, you know, what happened in the 20th century</a>
01:21:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h21m12s">which was so awful</a>
01:21:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h21m14s">and in so many places, it was just so unbelievably brutal and terrible and it was perpetrated by</a>
01:21:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h21m20s">millions of people, and they were individual people and they weren't that much different from normal people</a>
01:21:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h21m26s">and in fact they were normal people. So,</a>
01:21:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h21m28s">the other thing that struck me was that it would be better if that sort of thing didn't happen anymore</a>
01:21:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h21m33s">and so I was trying to figure what the hell could possibly be done about that, and</a>
01:21:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h21m37s">you know, part of Jung's contention was, well you had to understand yourself as a monster if you were ever going to</a>
01:21:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h21m43s">maintain some control over the fact that you are in fact a monster and that that could come forth if the situation is correct</a>
01:21:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h21m50s">Ok, that seems reasonable, and so,</a>
01:21:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h21m55s">Well it seemed to me that , you know, people had to become wiser</a>
01:21:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h21m59s">and, of course, that's a very difficult things to figure out, because you could even question</a>
01:21:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h22m04s">whether there is such a thing as wisdom, you know, and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h22m07s">and then I thought well that's what the universities are supposed to do, especially the humanities mostly, in particular</a>
01:22:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h22m13s">it is supposed to make you wise, that's what it's for</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h22m16s">and it's a doing a terrible job of that in my estimation</a>
01:22:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h22m19s">it's more decimating people as far as I can tell, and undermining whatever ethic that they have</a>
01:22:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h22m25s">rather than making people wise</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h22m29s">and,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h22m29s">but I think that we have to become wise, I don't think that there is a choice, I think it's a matter of survival, and</a>
01:22:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h22m35s">it's more than that, because if you're wise in your own life, you are going to have a way better life</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h22m49s">that's worth more than money. I know lots of people who have lots of money and let me tell you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h23m15s">you might think that if you had a bunch more money  things would be better</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h26m08s">So anyways, we talked about this song last week, and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h26m14s">you know, I made a hypothesis to you, we'll go through this quickly</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h26m20s">It's doggerel, it's not great poetry but it is irrelevant</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h26m27s">In the movie it actually sung by like a heavenly choir, that's what it sounds like, so</a>
01:26:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h26m31s">Its got this cathedral, you can imagine people singing it in a cathedral essentially,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h26m36s">and so that's not accidental, it's purposeful</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h26m39s">you know, it partakes of that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h26m43s">what would you call it, it partakes of that esthetic, that's. that's it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h26m48s">So the film makers are, are</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h26m52s">implying that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h26m53s">what is about to be shown to you has this</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h26m58s">divine element, essentially and that that's signified by the choir of voices that sings this song</a>
01:26:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h27m07s">and the song says, fundamentally something like this</a>
01:27:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h27m11s">is that if you lift up our eyes above the temporal, into the transcendent, and so that's</a>
01:27:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h27m17s">what exists in the heavenly world, in the stars</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h27m22s">if you pick an ultimate goal, if you pick the right ultimate goal</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h27m27s">then,</a>
01:27:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h27m27s">and anyone can do this, that's the other thing it's democratic</a>
01:27:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h27m31s">it's anyone can do this, so that's the second proposition, "It doesn't matter who you are"</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h27m36s">You can do this.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h27m37s">And so, I think that's a reflection of the idea of the divinity of the individual, it's like</a>
01:27:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h27m41s">there is something about each individual that's valuable, regardless of their idiosyncrasies , and</a>
01:27:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h27m46s">and so they have this potential that they can manifest, and how you manifest it? Well,</a>
01:27:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h27m50s">you pick the right goal, and, what's the right goal, well it's high</a>
01:27:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h27m55s">it's elevated, it's above the mundane</a>
01:27:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h27m57s">Now what does that mean? Well you don't really know, you don't really know? That's why it is signified by a star, and</a>
01:27:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h28m03s">the star is something that glimmers in the night, right</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h28m05s">so it's a source of light in the darkness</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h28m07s">And so, there is a metaphor in there, obviously, there is a metaphor there.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h28m11s">And, the star is the star that that's the star of Hollywood</a>
01:28:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h28m16s">you know, the person that you emulate, that's part of it because an ideal</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h28m19s">is, it's going to be a human ideal of some sort that you are going to be aiming at</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h28m23s">and so the ideal human being is the star that you are aiming at, maybe it's something like that.</a>
01:28:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h28m28s">If that's what you are aiming at, well you might say, well, "What should you aim at in life?" And one answer is, well,</a>
01:28:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h28m35s">Why don't you aim at being</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h28m37s">whatever you could be that would be the best!</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h28m40s">Now, you don't know what that is, exactly, because how do you know</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h28m44s">you know, what, you could think "Well that would be really good if I could have it" And then you could say, "Well,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h28m49s">can I think of anything better than that?" and if the answer is no, then well, why not go for that?</a>
01:28:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h28m55s">You know, well you might say, "Well, it's too ambitious, it takes too much responsibility."</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h29m03s">one of the things that I have figured out over the years is that if you offered the person the opportunity, you know</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h29m07s">because people say, "Well, life doesn't really have any ultimate meaning". It's like</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h29m12s">yeah, OK, fine, let's say that it has an ultimate meaning</a>
01:29:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h29m16s">but that in order to</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h29m18s">experience that ultimate meaning you have to take on ultimate responsibility for what you do.</a>
01:29:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h29m25s">That's a heavy price to pay to have a meaningful life.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h29m28s">You know, and you might say "Well, there's no damn way I going to do that, I'll just go for the, you know, pointless,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h29m37s">I'll go for the trivial pointless perspective, which is kind of hard on me existentially, but it frees me up, I can do whatever the hell I want,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h29m48s">and so then, you think "That's kind of a good deal". And then, but that raises this weird spectre</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h29m54s">of doubt, which is, well, when you hear people talk about the ultimate futility of life</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h29m58s">is it because life is ultimately futile, or is it because they have decided that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h30m03s">they would just as soon not adopt the responsibility, and they use that real decision, which is to not adopt the responsibility</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h30m11s">they rationalize that by proposing that life is ultimately meaningful (sic), meaningless</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h30m17s">and like, you know I kind of buy that, I really do think that's what is going on.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h30m23s">but maybe not</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h30m32s">Makes sense, and what might that mean?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h30m37s">Well one thing it might mean is that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h31m16s">that means that what other people have done, you could do</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h31m19s">and that also means you need to take responsibility for that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h31m24s">that's no joke, you know, it's a big deal to do that in even a trivial manner</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h31m30s">Anyways, so the idea is you can elevate, if you elevate you viewpoint to some transcendent</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h31m42s">You don't know, that's what you are aiming at</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h31m44s">Well then it says this strange thing, well what you want will all of a sudden come to you</a>
01:31:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h31m50s">well that's a proposition, and it's the proposition that basically played out in the movie.</a>
01:31:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h31m54s">It's a hypothesis, the hypothesis is, the best way to orient yourself</a>
01:31:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h31m58s">in life is to orient yourself towards the highest good that you are capable of imagining</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h32m02s">and then aim at that, and then things will work the best way they can for you.</a>
01:32:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h32m07s">And I think, I believe that that is correct, it's my observation of life</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h32m11s">has lead me to see that that seems to be correct</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h32m15s">So for example,</a>
01:32:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h32m16s">you don't get something that you don't aim at,</a>
01:32:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h32m18s">that just doesn't work out, and so lots of people aim at nothing and that's what they get.</a>
01:32:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h32m22s">So, if you aim at something you have a reasonable crack at getting it, you know</a>
01:32:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h32m26s">you tend to change what you are aiming at along the way because like what do you know, you know</a>
01:32:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h32m30s">You aim there, you are wrong but you get a little closer, and then you aim there and you are still wrong,</a>
01:32:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h32m34s">you get a little closer and you aim there, and, you know</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h32m37s">As you move towards what you are aiming at,  you are characterization of what to aim at becomes more and more sophisticated</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h32m44s">And so it doesn't really matter if you are wrong to begin with, as long as you are smart enough to learn on the way</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h32m48s">and as long as you specify a goal, so specify a vague one</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h33m07s">Well, that to me reflects this idea of a kind of integrated viewpoint.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h33m38s">what you want to do is you want to integrate your rationality with your emotions and your motivations</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h36m14s">because it wasn't going very well for her in social interactions, you know</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h45m07s">OK, OK, good, now so other people have a feeling instead of a voice, and so, is there anybody here</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h45m24s">I mean people can be conscientious,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h45m26s">and maybe those are people who listen to their conscience more</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h46m14s">is because human beings can speak and if you have a conscience, it's because human beings have a conscience,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h50m53s">Ok, so the cricket comes into the village there and he sees this little house, and</a>
01:50:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h50m58s">there is a little fire in it, and so, it's kind of got, it's a welcoming place, it's a light in the darkness</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h51m10s">the inside is cozy, you know, it's welcoming, and then when you look around you see that everything is kind of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h51m16s">in it's place, it's not hyper-organized or any thing like that, it's</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h51m23s">then there are toys everywhere, and they are well constructed, so you know that whoever lives there likes children</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h51m28s">and so, if someone likes children, well, someone that doesn't like children, it's like, you should run away from them very rapidly</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h51m34s">but if they like children, well then that's a good sign that, you know</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h51m49s">there's toys and clocks, and they are all hand made, and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h51m53s">so he is sort of infers that maybe there is a wood carver who lives there, and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h51m56s">a wood carver is someone who can build things, and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h52m04s">it's built right into the object, that's what quality is, quality is the building into an object of truth</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h52m15s">you see that everywhere in here, and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h52m17s">So you are getting the sense of, that the film makers are setting the stage</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h52m21s">and so,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h52m22s">well so they set the stage by showing you the stage and the cricket tells you what he sees, and he's</a>
01:52:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h52m27s">pretty happy to be there, because</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h52m28s">and this is also someone who is concerned about time, right, because there are a lot of clocks, there are a lot of clocks</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h52m34s">And so, time turns out to be an important sub-element of this story</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h52m37s">And then he sees the puppet, he's a marionette, and so, what's a marionette?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h52m42s">Well a marionette, and he's sitting on the shelf.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h52m45s">A marionette is something that is quasi-animated, because it can move</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h53m03s">Right, it doesn't have it's own volition</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h53m05s">It's dependent on the will of something behind the scenes</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h53m09s">And so, there is a strong implication that whatever this thing is, it's half formed</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h53m15s">and that it's, being manipulated by unseen forces behind</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h53m23s">behind the facade</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h53m38s">up in great ideological movements, like the communists or the fascists, those people are marionettes</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h53m54s">Well that is the question and that's partly what this movie tries to figure out. So,</a>
01:53:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h53m58s">you see this marionette, he's a half formed wooden headed puppet</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h54m03s">and he has a little bit of potential, you know, and the cricket goes up and interacts with him</a>
01:54:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h54m08s">and sees that he is made out of pretty good wood, and makes a little joke about having a wooden head</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h54m12s">and you know, that's kind of obvious what that means, and</a>
01:54:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h54m15s">you notice that the cricket is dressed like a tramp</a>
01:54:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h54m18s">and when you first saw him, he wasn't, he was dressed like a 1920's millionaire</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h54m23s">So, but here he is a tramp, and this is so interesting, it's like</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h54m28s">So this bug, that's a messiah, that's the introduction to the book</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h54m33s">that's the conscience, is also a tramp with no home, it's like, what does that mean?</a>
01:54:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h54m38s">And it took me a long time to sort that out, and it's like</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h54m41s">He has been everywhere, this tramp he has been everywhere, and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h54m45s">and he know, he's traveled the world, and, but he doesn't have a place, he doesn't have a home</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h54m52s">He hasn't made a relationship with anything real yet, he is kind of a potential</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h54m57s">And this is one of the things that is really interesting  about this movie because</a>
01:54:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h55m00s">if you think about the cricket as a fragment of the hero</a>
01:55:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h55m05s">and say, a reflection of the saviour, which is his relationship with J.C., of course</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h55m10s">and the person who introduces the book</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h55m14s">then the story gets strange, because</a>
01:55:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h55m16s">if it was merely a representation of the perfect person, the archetype of the hero</a>
01:55:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h55m20s">then the conscience would know everything, right?</a>
01:55:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h55m24s">And it would just tell the puppet what to do, and that would be the end of it</a>
01:55:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h55m27s">But that's a dull story, it's like, perfect conscience comes along, puppet does everything it says</a>
01:55:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h55m34s">Bingo! Perfection.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h55m36s">But that isn't what happens, there is this weird idea that this thing that has got all these attributes</a>
01:55:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h55m42s">Needs a home, and has to enter into a learning relationship with the thing that it's trying to transform</a>
01:55:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h55m49s">It's so sophisticated, because I could say, "You should do what your conscience tells you."</a>
01:55:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h55m54s">It's like, well maybe not, maybe that's not exactly how it works</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h55m58s">maybe your conscience isn't omniscient and omnipotent, maybe it's not God, right?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h56m04s">It's a guide, but it's maybe smarter than you sometimes</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h56m08s">Maybe because it's society in your head</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h56m10s">and obviously it's smarter than you sometimes because it tells you not to do something and you go do it and then</a>
01:56:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h56m15s">You get into trouble and you think, "Well if I would have just listened."</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h56m19s">but you don't, and that is interesting too, it's something that you don't have to listen to</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h56m23s">which is, seems to be associated with free will, it's weird, if your conscience knows what to do</a>
01:56:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h56m29s">why aren't you just a deterministic puppet of your conscience</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h56m33s">Christ! That would work a lot better, you wouldn't have to torture yourself, and you wouldn't make any mistakes, so</a>
01:56:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h56m38s">why the separation?</a>
01:56:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h56m39s">Well maybe it's because the conscience is generic</a>
01:56:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h56m43s">and so it has to be taught, it has to learn too, and so what you do is you have a dialogue with your conscience</a>
01:56:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h56m50s">it's something like that, and you expose yourself, to more and more of the world, and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h56m54s">you get wiser and your conscience gets wiser and you  mature together</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h56m59s">and that's what happens in this story because the cricket starts out as a, this tramp</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h57m03s">you know, that is smarter than the puppet, but not as smart as he thinks he is, that's for sure</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=01h57m08s">and, when he first starts to operate as a conscience he is a completely useless at it, he babbles of a lot of cliches</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h00m16s">and so we were having a discussion and, he is a determinist just right down to the bottom</a>
02:00:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h00m22s">it's like you are determined, you are determined, there is no free will</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h00m50s">But then I would also say that we do not have a scientific model for consciousness, we don't know a damn thing about conciousness</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h01m01s">was referred to by its critics as "Consciousness Explained Away"</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h01m05s">Which is exactly right as far as I am concerned, because he took a mechanistic approach and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h01m12s">there is something really weird about consciousness, I mean</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h01m40s">Well everything at once, it is something like that, it's not really comprehensible, as</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h01m51s">at least I am telling you that there are thoroughly coherent philosophical positions that make that case</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h05m03s">I don't care if you accept it as a proposition frankly, because I think the best indicator of what you believe</a>
02:05:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h05m09s">is how you act, not what you say.</a>
02:05:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h05m11s">Because what do you know about what you know, hardly anything.</a>
02:05:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h05m16s">And so, actions speak louder than words and if you want to be treated properly by someone is that you want to treat them</a>
02:05:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h05m23s">You want them to treat you as a valuable autonomous entity, that's what you want</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h05m29s">And, so maybe you're not that, maybe you are a deterministic puppet</a>
02:05:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h05m32s">and what this strange movie suggests is that you are a kind of deterministic puppet but you don't have to be</a>
02:05:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h05m39s">Alright,</a>
02:05:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h05m40s">well the mouth goes on, and then Geppetto is happy about that and then they have a little dance, you know, they</a>
02:05:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h05m46s">They turn the music on and all these little music boxes, and</a>
02:05:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h05m50s">they all play together and it's like</a>
02:05:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h05m52s">harmony of some sort has been established, because that's what the music represents, and</a>
02:05:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h05m57s">there are layers of reality that are communicating with one another because that's what the music represents and then they have a little dance</a>
02:05:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h06m03s">and the idea is that, well it's a good thing to let this puppet have it's own voice</a>
02:06:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h06m09s">Well that's an interesting idea because what the  hell does it know, it's a wooden headed marionette</a>
02:06:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h06m15s">Why the hell would you want something like that to talk?</a>
02:06:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h06m17s">Well it's the same question you have in relationship to you children</a>
02:06:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h06m21s">It's like what do they know, they are two, or three, you know, they don't know anything</a>
02:06:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h06m26s">Well so should you just tyrannize them, and make them do everything that you want, or are you going to let them have a bit of a voice?</a>
02:06:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h06m33s">And the question is whether you want them to be a puppet, or not.</a>
02:06:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h06m37s">And if you don't want them to be a puppet, if you want them to grow up autonomous, then then you let them have a voice.</a>
02:06:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h06m43s">And you facilitate the development of that voice, and so</a>
02:06:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h06m47s">and that's, and that's what you do if you don't want a marionette</a>
02:06:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h06m51s">So, and Geppetto doesn't want a marionette, so he gives the puppet a voice, even though he knows it's just a puppet</a>
02:06:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h06m58s">and that it doesn't know anything</a>
02:06:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h07m00s">And then, this is fantastic, the cricket is sitting up there watching that, he is pretty happy with it</a>
02:07:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h07m05s">that's the first little scene you see there, and he is sitting by this other thing that is just not happy at all</a>
02:07:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h07m11s">And that's the terrible father, and you see it's a character that repeats throughout the</a>
02:07:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h07m16s">entire movie, you see manifestations of the tyrannical father continually through the movie</a>
02:07:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h07m21s">in different characters, it's like he is played out by different roles</a>
02:07:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h07m24s">And so, first of all the cricket is so thrilled about this, and then he looks at the frowning king there</a>
02:07:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h07m30s">Who is not happy that the puppet has been given a voice, he is a tyrant, right, he is the representation of a tyrant</a>
02:07:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h07m36s">and a tyrant does not want you to have a voice</a>
02:07:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h07m38s">And so, the cricket looks at him and says</a>
02:07:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h07m40s">"Well, you can't please everybody all the time"</a>
02:07:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h07m43s">and it's just a tiny little fragment of a joke, you know, but it's. There is this old idea</a>
02:07:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h07m49s">I think that it comes from Chekov, and the idea is that, if you set a play up, and there is a gun, a rifle</a>
02:07:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h07m54s">or a pistol on a table in the first act, it had better been used by the third act or it shouldn't have been there at all</a>
02:07:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h08m02s">And the idea is, you don't put anything in you play that's random, you never do that, it' like</a>
02:08:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h08m09s">because this isn't life, this isn't life this is a work of art and everything</a>
02:08:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h08m14s">is connected and it is there by intent</a>
02:08:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h08m18s">And so, this isn't accidental that this little king character doesn't like what is going on, or that he shows up.</a>
02:08:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h08m26s">So anyways, all the clocks go off and the music boxes go, and the have a little dance and everybody is happy about it</a>
02:08:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h08m33s">And then, Geppetto notices what time it is, and there is a tremendous emphasis on time in this part of the movie</a>
02:08:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h08m39s">Because there are all these clocks going off, and they are all telling him what time it is, like 30 clocks go off, and then he takes</a>
02:08:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h08m45s">watch out that and notices what time it is, it's like the idea that there is something about time</a>
02:08:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h08m51s">going on, is like whacked at you, you know dozens of times, so that you get it</a>
02:08:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h08m57s">And it's a little joke that he pulls out his watch and he figures out that it is time from bed</a>
02:08:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h09m01s">Well, so now we are making the transition between the conscious world and the unconscious  world</a>
02:09:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h09m07s">OK, so there is an intimation in the movie that everything that happens now is in the unconscious world</a>
02:09:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h09m14s">and the way you know that is that, it's strange, because the movie moves in and out this underworld</a>
02:09:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h09m20s">but at the very end when Pinocchio is transformed into a real boy</a>
02:09:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h09m24s">the last thing that Geppetto does is, I think that it's Geppetto, hit one of the pendulums and start all the clocks again</a>
02:09:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h09m33s">So it's as if, what happens from here onwards is part of a dream</a>
02:09:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h09m37s">Now it's murky because, Pinocchio goes to school, and you know, there is the next day and all of that, but</a>
02:09:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h09m44s">and so those are sort of realistic elements, but then there is the whole going down into the ocean</a>
02:09:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h09m48s">to find the whale thing that seems completely dreamlike</a>
02:09:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h09m52s">But there is an intimation that we are in a different kind of world, and so</a>
02:09:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h09m56s">They all go to sleep, including the cricket.</a>
02:09:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h09m59s">And so, then Geppetto notices the star!</a>
02:09:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h10m03s">And, because he is a good guy he makes a wish on the star and we have already</a>
02:10:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h10m06s">explained why you might wish on a star, and what that might mean, and he makes a very interesting wish.</a>
02:10:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h10m14s">It's not a self-serving wish, in fact it's quite the contrary, he doesn't wish that Pinocchio is an obediant son.</a>
02:10:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h10m21s">He doesn't wish that he produced someone who will work for him.</a>
02:10:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h10m25s">He doesn't wish any of that, he wishes for what a good father would wish.</a>
02:10:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h10m29s">Which is that the creation that he has brought forth</a>
02:10:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h10m33s">would develop it's capacity for autonomy.</a>
02:10:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h10m36s">He wants him to become real, he wants him to become an actual living creature and not and not a wooden headed marionette</a>
02:10:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h10m43s">And so you would say that is what your father should wish for you, you know, and I have clients</a>
02:10:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h10m48s">frequently whose father's weren't like that at all, they were tyrannical or they were negelectful or</a>
02:10:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h10m53s">or the punished the person every time they did something good, that's a real fun game.</a>
02:10:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h11m00s">They competed with them and undermined them at every opportunity, they didn't want to produce someone strong and autonomous</a>
02:11:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h11m07s">They wanted to</a>
02:11:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h11m10s">give birth to a slave and then diminish it as much as possible</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h11m14s">And so, that's bad, it's not good, and so Geppetto is not like that, so he says, "Well, I am going to wish for</a>
02:11:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h11m20s">something completely unreasonable", which is part of that ideal idea, right?</a>
02:11:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h11m26s">And the unreasonable thing is that this puppet</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h11m29s">could become</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h11m31s">real! Could actually take on it's autonomy and move forward. And so that's what he wishes.</a>
02:11:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h11m39s">And then they go to sleep</a>
02:11:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h11m42s">And then the cricket starts to become driven mad by the noises of the clock, so it's like he is going into this state of hyper-alertness</a>
02:11:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h11m50s">And the clocks are clanging at him and Geppetto is snoring and</a>
02:11:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h11m55s">he can even hear the little grains of sand falling out of the hourglass, he is becoming hyper-alert</a>
02:11:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h12m03s">And then he yells, "Stop!", and all the clocks stop</a>
02:12:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h12m07s">Which is a pretty good trick for a cricket, you know, he is the master of time but also we are in a place where time has</a>
02:12:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h12m13s">come to a stop, we are outside of time.</a>
02:12:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h12m15s">And one of the things that Freud pointed out about dreams is that, dreams are kind of outside of time.</a>
02:12:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h12m21s">Now, here is what that means, is first of all they draw on eternal themes, that's part of it</a>
02:12:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h12m26s">but you know, you must had had this experience, Freud noted this carefully in the "Interpretation of Dreams" where</a>
02:12:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h12m31s">you know you are sleeping and the alarm will go off,  and the alarm noise is incorporated into the dream</a>

02:12:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h12m44s">It's like, and there is no reason why your dream time should be the same as real time because it is all going on in your imagination, but</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h12m51s">It's amazing in some sense, how much can happen in such a short period of time in your imagination, and so</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h13m13s">and it turns into this blue fairy, whose got a celestial gown covered with stars</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h13m21s">and who has got wings, so she is some kind of ethereal being and, like, you don't have a problem with that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h13m28s">in the movie, it's like, "Yeah, sure, I mean you know, it's a fairy that came from a star, that makes perfect sense.", which of course it's makes no sense</a>
02:13:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h13m35s">whatsoever</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h13m36s">right, it makes no sense, but you are willing to go along with it because,</a>
02:13:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h13m39s">on the one hand it makes no sense, and on the other hand it makes perfect sense</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h13m44s">It's like the fairy godmother idea, it's like, "Yeah, yeah fairy godmother, no problem, we got that."</a>
02:13:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h13m49s">And the idea there is that well, Nature comes to your aid, it's something like that,</a>
02:13:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h13m55s">It's the benevolent force of Nature is on you side, now, not obviously, only on your side</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h14m00s">because it opposes you as well, but</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h14m04s">And there is your own mother as well, who is also Nature whose on your side, and so</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h14m09s">but there is an idea here and the idea is that if the father gets the wish right</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h14m15s">the aim right for the child</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h14m17s">then Nature will cooperate</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h14m19s">Right, and that is true, I believe that that's true, is that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h14m22s">if you set up your relationship, your cultural relationship with your child properly</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h14m33s">establishing the proper aim.  And so that's what happens, Geppetto says, well this is what I am aiming at</a>
02:14:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h14m40s">and because he is aiming at it, and because it is in the realm of possibility, maybe Nature comes to his service, and</a>
02:14:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h14m47s">that is how it works, that's exactly how it works because when you aim at something</a>
02:14:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h14m52s">then, you muster your biological forces towards that goal, and, if the goal is</a>
02:14:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h14m59s">feasible, and attainable, then you will cooperate with yourself</a>
02:14:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h15m05s">And so that's quite cool, Carl Rogers would call that</a>
02:15:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h15m09s">What's the word for that?</a>
02:15:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h15m11s">I think he called it genuineness which is kind of weak</a>
02:15:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h15m15s">but I think that is still what he called it, he sort of meant that, that's sort of what happens when your</a>
02:15:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h15m21s">goals and your physiological and biological being are alined well, and you're</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h15m26s">and you can communicate both, you are not full of internal contradictions</a>
02:15:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h15m29s">And so, your conscious aims and your biological possibilities are manifesting themselves in the same direction</a>
02:15:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h15m38s">and so, that would be good!</a>
02:15:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h15m39s">So anyways, the fairy shows up and she is quite sexually attractive, she is quite provocative</a>
02:15:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h15m44s">and she charms the cricket</a>
02:15:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h15m46s">who gets all, blushes and like, is all, you know embarrased and</a>
02:15:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h15m52s">overwhelmed by this like figure of celestial beauty and decides to cooperate, the conscience decides to cooperate</a>
02:15:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h16m00s">and gets some responsibility, and so</a>
02:16:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h16m03s">the fairy allows the puppet to move without strings</a>
02:16:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h16m08s">So that's kind of interesting, it's the intervention of Nature. Culture focuses the aim,</a>
02:16:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h16m13s">and then it's the intervention of Nature that produces the autonomy</a>
02:16:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h16m17s">and that seems to be right, I mean even though it's not that understandable, it seems to be right.</a>
02:16:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h16m21s">And then, so, she</a>
02:16:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h16m24s">takes the strings off Pinocchio, and you might say well that's partly because your child is not</a>
02:16:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h16m29s">certainly not just a creature of culture, by no means, your child has a temperament, you'll see that right away</a>
02:16:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h16m35s">and that temperament will unfold</a>
02:16:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h16m37s">and hopefully it will unfold in a cultural context that's amenable to it, and that the combination of those two produce something new.</a>
02:16:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h16m47s">He can talk,</a>
02:16:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h16m50s">he can walk</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h16m51s">and so the good fairy basically tells him that</a>
02:16:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h16m55s">he has got a bit of autonomy and now it is up to him to</a>
02:16:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h16m58s">like clue in a bit, and act properly, and learn the difference between good and evil, and to speak truthfully and all of that, it's a bit</a>
02:16:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h17m05s">propagandistic that part of the movie, I would say, but it doesn't really matter it is kind of the inculcation of conventional morality</a>
02:17:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h17m11s">and, there's a fair bit to it, especially that he is supposed to tell the truth</a>
02:17:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h17m15s">and, you know, he says he will, and the cricket is listening, and then</a>
02:17:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h17m21s">the puppet asks, "Well what does conscience mean?" because the fairy says always let your conscience be your guide</a>
02:17:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h17m28s">and he says, "Well what does conscience mean?" and the bug, whose like all puffed up because he wants to impress the fairy</a>
02:17:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h17m33s">pops down and gets on his little matchbox and gives this like horrible little lecture about</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h17m38s">how to behave properly, that's just like ideological chatter, you can hardly even stand listening to it, and</a>
02:17:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h17m44s">it's supposed to be like that, it's generic moral advice that anyone could give</a>
02:17:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h17m50s">that is kind of dull and also puffed up and grandiose, he's just not very good at it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h17m56s">So that's why he is on his little matchbox there, with his chest puffed out, and so</a>
02:17:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h18m01s">he says, "That's just the trouble with the world today." [sarcastic falsetto]</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h18m04s">and I think that's his opening line, you know</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h18m06s">He's diagnosing the whole world, and, you know, the fairy, she thinks he is kind of funny because he is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h18m12s">And you know , it's sort of, there is a real interesting thing here going on because he's male, and he's</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h18m18s">he's all puffed up with his knowledge, which is completely shallow and, he is put in contact with this like celestial feminine ideal</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h18m25s">and he just turns into a complete moron, and that's exactly what happens to men, it happens to them all the time</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h18m30s">So, anyways, she decides to give him a chance and turns him into this conscience, and all of a sudden</a>
02:18:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h18m36s">he's this 1920's millionaire, so he's, he has been ennobled,  but then she tells him, that, you know</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h18m53s">and that's why he is on the matchbox, podium, you know, espousing his morality, but</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h18m58s">the reality turns out to be much more complex</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h19m32s">is not something that you can articulate easily as a table of rules, it's not like that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h20m21s">So it's stamping home the notion that Geppetto is, in fact, a good guy and that is, in fact, what he wants</a>
02:20:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h20m27s">So, it's like, the encouragement of your father is the precondition for the emergence of your individuality</a>
02:20:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h20m34s">And it also allows the feminine to play a role, both as Nature and perhaps as mother</a>
02:20:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h20m40s">and so, the combination of those two things produces the autonomous individual, it's like that seems perfectly reasonable</a>
02:20:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h20m47s">So, off they go to sleep, the next day they wake up</a>
02:20:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h20m51s">and it's a new day, and Pinocchio is off to school, and that's a good thing too, because</a>
02:20:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h20m57s">Geppetto isn't, and he is really excited about it, and so what that means is that</a>
02:20:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h21m01s">He's been parented properly, he is going to go out in the world of his peers, which is where he belongs</a>
02:21:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h21m08s">and Geppetto isn't to worried about it, in fact, he is pushing him out the door, you know</a>
02:21:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h21m12s">It's like, go, you can do it, this is the next thing!</a>
02:21:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h21m15s">The kid isn't cowering in the corner and cowering in terror, with the parents freaking out about all the things that are going to go wrong, it's...</a>
02:21:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h21m23s">There is some faith in his ability, so</a>
02:21:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h21m26s">he sees all the kids wandering by and Geppetto dresses him up, and sends him off to school.</a>
02:21:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h21m33s">And so, and so that's good, that's a happy family story, it's like, Mom and Dad got together, they decided that the</a>
02:21:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h21m40s">kid was going to, you know, be competent and autonomous and ready to face the world, and so</a>
02:21:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h21m46s">out he goes, and so he's like five years old at this point and that is where we get</a>
02:21:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h21m51s">that's were we are at</a>
02:21:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h21m53s">in the story.</a>
02:21:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h21m54s">And I think that that is a good place to stop, because the next thing that happens is,</a>
02:21:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h22m00s">anomaly essentially, Pinocchio goes off to be a good boy</a>
02:22:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h22m03s">but it turns out that is a hell of a lot more complicated than he might think because</a>
02:22:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h22m08s">there are actually, complications in the world, but also malevolence</a>
02:22:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h22m13s">Right, the desire for things not to go right, there are people who are not oriented towards</a>
02:22:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h22m19s">the ideal, in any way at all, and Pinocchio is young and naive,</a>
02:22:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h22m25s">and so he has no defense what whatsoever against this malevolance, and that's, you know</a>
02:22:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h22m35s">That's not unexpected, and it also turns out that the conscience, the cricket, who is still not very clued in, oversleeps</a>
02:22:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h22m44s">And so he's just not there at a critical moment</a>
02:22:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h22m47s">But I think that we will pick that up next week, because this is a good point in the plot to stop</a>
02:22:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h22m53s">The child has entered the broader world and has to cope with it</a>
02:22:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h22m57s">And so, he's prepared because he had a wonderful father and he had a magical mother</a>
02:22:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h23m02s">and so he is prepared as you can be, he is even not completely a marionette anymore</a>
02:23:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h23m08s">but, now it's up to him, that's the thing, now it's up to him, his parents have done basically what they could</a>
02:23:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h23m15s">And that's really about right, you know</a>
02:23:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h23m18s">It's wise, I would say, psychologically</a>
02:23:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2lyN7rM4E#t=02h23m21s">Alright, so, that's that!</a>
