story or sub personality or game or map.</a>
00:00:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h00m22s">So what I’ve discussed with you so far is
that there are different ways that you can</a>
00:00:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h00m31s">construe the objects and territories that
you inhabit, and that modern people generally</a>
00:00:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h00m41s">think that the world they inhabit is one that's
defined by science, but I would say - I would</a>
00:00:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h00m51s">say actually it depends on which scientist
you mean because I don't believe that the</a>
00:00:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h00m57s">worldview that emerges as a logical consequence
of Darwinism is the same worldview that emerges</a>
00:00:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h01m02s">as a logical consequence of Newtonian presuppositions
and you know the reason I’m bringing Newton</a>
00:01:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h01m10s">into it is because we still think in Newtonian
terms and it’s been more than a hundred</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h01m15s">years or about a hundred years I guess, since
Newton’s model was expanded by quantum physics,</a>
00:01:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h01m20s">but no one thinks that way because you can't
think that way and besides that, the reason</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h01m25s">you don't think that way is because at the
level of resolution that you exist, things</a>
00:01:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h01m30s">behave in a Newtonian manner so it’s in
accordance with some of our natural perceptions.</a>
00:01:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h01m38s">Now, I started thinking this way for a variety
of reasons but I was influenced later by a</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h01m46s">guy named Gibson - JJ Gibson, who wrote a
book called “An Ecological Approach to Visual</a>
00:01:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h01m51s">Perception.”</a>
00:01:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h01m52s">And he made the case, quite strongly, that
what you directly perceive is the implication</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h01m59s">of situations and objects.</a>
00:01:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h02m01s">So for example, I suppose you've all seen
the famous visual cliff experiment with babies</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h02m07s">where if you put a piece of glass across an
open space and the space is evidently deep,</a>
00:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h02m17s">the baby won’t cross the glass and so there's
some evidence there for relatively innate,</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h02m21s">not only depth processing.</a>
00:02:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h02m23s">It’s not just depth processing, right, because
in order to not crawl off that, you also have</a>
00:02:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h02m29s">to perceive that - well Gibson would say that
it’s a falling off place, and he would say</a>
00:02:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h02m34s">that's actually what you perceive is a falling
off place and then maybe you can extract out</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h02m38s">the idea of cliff, but that isn't what you
perceive and you know, the sense you have</a>
00:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h02m47s">when a bear is chasing you that’s dangerous,
that doesn't seem to be merely psychological</a>
00:02:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h02m53s">in a sense like it’s not merely, in a sense,
not - it’s not less real than perceiving</a>
00:02:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h03m00s">the bear as an object.</a>
00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h03m01s">An object that eats you is not the same object
as an object that remains neutral to you or</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h03m09s">positive, and it seems quite clear, and this
is where the Darwinian issue I think arises,</a>
00:03:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h03m15s">that you have to evaluate with your perception
because otherwise you're too slow.</a>
00:03:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h03m25s">So anyways, I developed this diagram as a
consequence of thinking about these things</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h03m34s">for a long time, and the diagram is predicated
on the idea that when you begin to act in</a>
00:03:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h03m41s">the world, you're inside a motivational frame,
let’s say, and that motivational frame can</a>
00:03:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h03m47s">be instantiated or put into practice or put
into place by any number of underlying motivational</a>
00:03:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h03m57s">systems, some of them the more basic motivational
systems that we share with animals going far</a>
00:03:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h04m05s">back down the evolutionary chain and some
of them more complex mixtures of emotional</a>
00:04:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h04m12s">or motivational drives that been organized
across lengthy periods of times in social</a>
00:04:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h04m21s">circumstances.</a>
00:04:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h04m23s">So for example, if you're at a bar and you're
looking for someone, it’s not really reasonable</a>
00:04:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h04m33s">to say - we’ll take the simple case.</a>
00:04:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h04m36s">It’s not really reasonable to say that your
behavior is motivated by sex because that's</a>
00:04:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h04m44s">what happens only if you're actually in a
sexual act.</a>
00:04:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h04m50s">Before that, the motivations are multiple
and they have to be because otherwise you</a>
00:04:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h04m54s">wouldn't have the sophistication to begin
a conversation with anyone.</a>
00:04:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h05m00s">So to think of that as driven in some sense
by sexuality means either to consider a much</a>
00:05:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h05m07s">more expanded notion of sexuality or to not
consider it driven in that manner.</a>
00:05:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h05m14s">Now, I think it’s reasonable to make the
presumption that you're motivated to move</a>
00:05:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h05m21s">ahead and we know that for a variety of reasons.</a>
00:05:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h05m26s">Partly that’s because if you look at the
brain at the level of the hypothalamus which</a>
00:05:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h05m30s">is a very, very archaic and primordial subsystem
in the brain, then it’s roughly divided</a>
00:05:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h05m40s">into two parts and one part is responsible
for a lot of the things we consider basic</a>
00:05:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h05m46s">motivations, and the other part is responsible
for exploration.</a>
00:05:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h05m53s">So the dopaminergic tracts whose operation
underlies movement forward and incentive reward</a>
00:05:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h06m04s">and what you generally experience as the sorts
of positive emotion associated with hope,</a>
00:06:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h06m09s">and excitement, and curiosity, that system
is instantiated in the hypothalamus, and a</a>
00:06:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h06m14s">lot of the hypothalamus is devoted to it.</a>
00:06:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h06m18s">So, as a very primordial system whose operation
appears to be a default.</a>
00:06:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h06m29s">It’s a default operation if none of the
other motivational systems need current attention.</a>
00:06:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h06m37s">Well the other default I suppose is sleep
or rest and you can certainly see that in</a>
00:06:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h06m41s">animals because, you know, if you have a cat
you’ll notice - of course they’re nocturnal,</a>
00:06:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h06m45s">but they'll sleep a large part of the day
and so do dogs.</a>
00:06:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h06m50s">So, you know, if you're not looking for a
partner, if you don't want to play, if you're</a>
00:06:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h06m55s">not hungry, not thirsty, and so on, not under
the grip of any direct biological necessity</a>
00:06:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h07m00s">let’s say, then your default position is
to rest or sleep or to explore, and the thing</a>
00:07:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h07m09s">about the exploratory circuit is it’s really
old.</a>
00:07:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h07m12s">It’s as old as pain.</a>
00:07:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h07m14s">It’s as old as lust.</a>
00:07:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h07m16s">It’s as old as anger.</a>
00:07:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h07m17s">It’s as old as hunger.</a>
00:07:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h07m19s">It’s as old as thirst.</a>
00:07:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h07m20s">Like it’s a really, really old system.</a>
00:07:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h07m22s">It’s a very primordial system, and human
beings are quite hyper exploratory, at least</a>
00:07:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h07m30s">collectively as you can tell because we keep
inventing new things and exchanging new modes</a>
00:07:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h07m36s">of being.</a>
00:07:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h07m38s">So, you can say in some sense that you have
a drive to engage with the world and to expand</a>
00:07:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h07m46s">your domain of knowledge.</a>
00:07:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h07m49s">And the reason that you have that is because
the human race has gambled on that as a sufficient</a>
00:07:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h07m58s">means of ensuring adaptation into the future,
you know, and it’s a strange one because</a>
00:07:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h08m04s">most animals are very, very conservative.</a>
00:08:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h08m06s">In fact, most human societies are very, very
conservative so it’s certainly possible</a>
00:08:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h08m12s">for even relatively modern human societies
- so let’s say those that have arisen in</a>
00:08:12</p>

00:12:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h12m37s">is the one that helps you highlight those
few things in the vast perceptual world of</a>

00:12:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h12m50s">So now, you can see that.</a>
00:12:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h12m53s">I mean the most dramatic example of that - I
was really personally thrilled about Dan Simon’s</a>
00:12:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h13m00s">gorilla experiments because I’d been thinking
about this for a long time before that experiment</a>
00:13:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h13m07s">came out and it was the clearest demonstration
I had seen.</a>
00:13:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h13m10s">I mean, there's a lot of demonstrations like
that now but it was the clearest demonstration</a>
00:13:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h13m13s">I’d ever seen that indeed most of what you're
perceptual systems do is exclude.</a>
00:13:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h13m21s">Now what that means - this is the tricky thing
is that what that means is that wrapped up</a>
00:13:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h13m27s">in what you exclude is the entire - is all
of being, virtually and that's a very tricky</a>
00:13:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h13m35s">problem because when you're excluding all

00:13:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h13m41s">value to zero.</a>
00:13:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h13m43s">You say, “Well except for those few things
that I’m concentrating on now, everything</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h13m49s">else is zero and it’s zero and unchanging.”</a>
00:13:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h13m52s">And the problem with that is that lots of
times that’s not right.</a>
00:13:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h13m57s">Now it’s right enough, luckily enough, and
I suppose this is a consequence of evolution</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h14m03s">too.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h14m04s">We’re fast enough or slow enough, depending
on how you look at it so that we can assume</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h14m16s">Now, from a philosophical perspective that's
inadequate.</a>
00:14:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h14m21s">Some of you might have heard of the phrase
“The scandal of induction.”</a>
00:14:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h14m27s">Well, it’s a pointer to a very profound
philosophical problem and the philosophical</a>
00:14:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h14m35s">problem is how do you know the same thing
that happened before is going to happen next?</a>
00:14:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h14m41s">And the answer to that is generally you don't
know, and it’s a very tricky issue to come</a>
00:14:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h14m47s">to terms with you know.</a>
00:14:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h14m50s">I think you can think of things as you know,
if you think about a hierarchy of resolution</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h14m57s">again.</a>
00:14:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h14m58s">I think you can think of things as very, rather
predictably, in their unpredictability.</a>
00:14:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h15m04s">So for example, there's some indication that
protons decay.</a>
00:15:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h15m08s">But they decay over such a long time frame
that the probability that that’s going to</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h15m12s">affect us is virtually zero, and there's other
things that we interact with quite regularly</a>
00:15:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h15m17s">like the sun that are stable across timeframes
that make it virtually ignorable.</a>
00:15:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h15m28s">Well I’ll tell you a story about that, and
this is a good story to indicate how everything</a>
00:15:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h15m33s">is nested in what you ignore.</a>
00:15:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h15m35s">So, part of this story is fictional, but part
of it isn’t.</a>
00:15:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h15m40s">So, one time when I was in graduate school
in Quebec, in Montreal, I was typing on my</a>

you know computers do that and so what happens</a>
00:15:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h15m56s">when your computer stops?</a>
00:15:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h15m58s">Well, the first thing that happens is it depends
on what you're working on.</a>
00:15:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h16m01s">That’s the critical issue right?</a>
00:16:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h16m04s">So what happens is that you have a reaction
that's proportionate to the deemed importance</a>
00:16:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h16m10s">of what it was that you’re working on and
there's going to be an association between</a>
00:16:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h16m14s">that and deadlines, and there's going to be
an association between that and amount written</a>
00:16:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h16m19s">that you think you might have lost, and then.</a>
00:16:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h16m23s">So there's, there's - because what you're
doing is nested in a hierarchy, you know,</a>
00:16:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h16m28s">I’m writing a sentence to write a paragraph

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h16m55s">assume the worst although you might immediately

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h19m08s">for a variety of reasons, including the fact
that the Earth is magnetic and for complicated</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h19m21s">But now and then those things are so powerful
that they’ll - well here’s an example.</a>
00:19:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h19m27s">If you have a hydrogen bomb, a big one, and
you detonate it in the middle of North America</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h19m36s">permanently because what happens is that when
the bomb goes off, there's an electromagnetic</a>
00:19:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h19m40s">pulse and that produces an electric current
that runs through the wiring, and that'll</a>

00:19:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h19m53s">So, well that's what the sun is.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h19m55s">The sun is a massive hydrogen bomb and so
now and then it goes off with the force of,</a>
00:19:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h20m00s">you know, millions of hydrogen bombs and then
we get the pulse radiating towards us and</a>
00:20:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h20m06s">then it sets a current in the power grid which

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h20m52s">So for example, our power supply is unbelievably

to keep the power on, but they do and so we</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h21m04s">can sit here and ignore it, and we can concentrate

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h21m53s">These are things that are going to help get
you to your goal, and whenever you see those,</a>
00:21:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h21m59s">you get a burst of positive emotion and basically
that means two things, that positive emotion.</a>
00:21:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h22m05s">Think about it as a little dopamine kick,
and this is where this story differentiates</a>
00:22:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h22m10s">a little bit from classic behaviorism.</a>
00:22:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h22m12s">So the behaviorists would say you get a little
dopamine kick and that increases the probability</a>
00:22:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h22m16s">that the action that you just took will be
taken again in the future, and so it’s partly</a>
00:22:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h22m22s">because the dopamine kick has a positive emotional
- it provides a positive emotional experience</a>
00:22:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h22m31s">but it’s also because the dopamine facilitates
neural growth, and so if you're beetling along</a>
00:22:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h22m36s">and something good happens to you, then your
brain makes the things you were doing - the</a>
00:22:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h22m41s">circuits that underlie the things you were
doing just before the good thing happened</a>
00:22:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h22m44s">- a little bit stronger.</a>
00:22:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h22m46s">But, the other thing that happens when you're
beetling along and doing your positive thing</a>
00:22:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h22m54s">is that you get a little dopamine - is that
the fact that it’s working also validates</a>
00:22:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h22m58s">your frame of reference because you know you
know might say well, if what you're doing</a>

how is it that you're right?</a>
00:23:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h23m09s">And the answer to that is well in some ways,
you're right enough up the entire hierarchy</a>
00:23:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h23m16s">and so what that means is that every time
you proceed along the path that you've chosen</a>
00:23:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h23m22s">and that's working, that entire structure
gets stabilized a bit more, and that's how</a>
00:23:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h23m27s">it should be.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h23m29s">Now, I've tried to work out how exactly this
happens and I can give you the best example</a>
00:23:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h23m35s">by telling you about cocaine addicts.</a>
00:23:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h23m36s">So, addicts 
use to have this phrase.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h23m58s">Now, you know, you think about that as being

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h24m26s">I’ll first tell you what happens to cocaine
addicts if you take them out into a treatment</a>

00:24:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h24m31s">Heroin addicts is the same thing, roughly
speaking.</a>
00:24:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h24m34s">So you take this person who’s dependant
out to a treatment center, and with heroin,</a>
00:24:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h24m41s">say, you have to let them go through withdrawal.</a>
00:24:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h24m44s">And that takes about forty eight hours, something
like that, and you've seen movie representations</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h24m50s">of it, but it’s been compared by reasonable

00:24:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h24m56s">So, alcohol withdrawal, by the way - that
kills you often.</a>
00:24:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h25m01s">You have a seizure and you die.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h25m03s">So if you're an alcoholic and you go to the

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h25m07s">give you valium or something like that so
you don't seize yourself to death while you're</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h25m12s">withdrawing.</a>
00:25:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h25m13s">You know, when you have a hangover, part of
that is that - part of what’s happened is</a>
00:25:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h25m16s">you've actually lowered your seizure threshold.</a>
00:25:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h25m18s">Something to think about if you're prone to

00:25:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h25m22s">It’s a bad idea to have a hangover.</a>
00:25:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h25m25s">In fact they bred mice to study hangovers.</a>
00:25:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h25m27s">They bred mice that could drink alcohol and
then they’d get a very bad hangover, and</a>
00:25:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h25m31s">if you showed them a cat, they would have
a seizure.</a>
00:25:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h25m34s">So, because the fear was enough to trigger
seizures.</a>
00:25:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h25m37s">So yeah, well you gotta get seizures going
somehow if you're gonna study them, and that's</a>
00:25:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h25m45s">- and that can be bred.</a>
00:25:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h25m47s">So anyways, you take your heroin addict, let’s
say, and they get over their withdrawal and</a>
00:25:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h25m53s">so that means that technically they're no
longer physiologically dependant on the drug.</a>
00:25:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h25m58s">Now that doesn't mean their work is over by
no means.</a>
00:25:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h26m04s">But frequently the treatment center, as long
as the person is nowhere near where they usually</a>
00:26:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h26m09s">are, once they’ve gone through withdrawal,
they can stay away from the drug quite effectively,</a>
00:26:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h26m15s">but the problem is as soon as you put them
back in the situation that they came from,</a>
00:26:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h26m22s">and they're around the things that have been
associated with heroin, let's say, they get</a>
00:26:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h26m26s">a craving.</a>
00:26:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h26m28s">And the cravings haven't gone away.</a>
00:26:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h26m30s">That's a different system than the system
that went through withdrawal, and so they</a>
00:26:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h26m36s">always relapse.</a>
00:26:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h26m39s">Now, you think about how this craving works,
and I've seen this probably most seriously</a>
00:26:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h26m47s">I guess with cocaine addicts, but also with
alcoholics.</a>
00:26:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h26m51s">So, imagine what you have to do in order to
become an addict.</a>
00:26:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h26m56s">You know, the first thing is that you have
to start using the drug.</a>
00:26:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h27m01s">Okay, but that - and fair enough.</a>
00:27:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h27m04s">People experiment with all sorts of drugs
and so, you know, that's part of human nature.</a>
00:27:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h27m09s">You know, it’s risky and dangerous but it’s
not yet catastrophic.</a>
00:27:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h27m12s">But then let’s say you start using it enough
so that you can't not use it.</a>
00:27:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h27m17s">You have to use it everyday or something like
that, and then the next thing that happens</a>
00:27:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h27m21s">is that it gets a little bit expensive, and
so then your life is starting to go downhill</a>
00:27:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h27m26s">because you're spending all your time trying
to gather resources to get some more of the</a>
00:27:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h27m29s">drug.</a>
00:27:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h27m30s">Now, what you might ask yourself is what do
you have - like exactly what’s the chain</a>
00:27:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h27m36s">of behaviors that's being reinforced by the
drug?</a>
00:27:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h27m40s">Well somewhere along the way, you know, maybe
when you're just starting to misuse it, there's</a>
00:27:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h27m47s">part of you that's saying, “You know, really
this is probably not a good idea.”</a>
00:27:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h27m55s">And then there's another part of you that
has a different thought which might be, “Oh</a>
00:27:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h27m58s">to hell with it.</a>
00:27:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h27m59s">It’s only one.</a>
00:27:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h28m01s">It’s only tonight.”</a>
00:28:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h28m02s">And so then you take the drug, and then there's
chain leading from the thought to the drug</a>
00:28:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h28m07s">behavior.</a>
00:28:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h28m10s">But the drug reinforces all the way back along
that chain.</a>
00:28:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h28m13s">So what happens is that little system that
thinks, “Oh to hell with it, it’s only</a>
00:28:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h28m17s">one night,” gets a little stronger.</a>
00:28:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h28m20s">Now, it doesn't get as strong as the systems
that are being reinforced that are activated</a>
00:28:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h28m27s">directly before the drug hit, but the thing
is that maybe you take heroin in fifty different</a>
00:28:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h28m36s">situations and so you're conditioning yourself
to cues in all those different situations.</a>
00:28:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h28m40s">You use slightly different behaviors and so
on, so there's different things being shaped,</a>
00:28:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h28m44s">but one of the things that's always being
reinforced, even though not that much, is</a>
00:28:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h28m49s">this thought pattern, and the thought pattern
is something like “Oh to hell with it, doesn’t</a>
00:28:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h28m55s">matter anyways” because you have to think
that in order to - especially at the beginning</a>
00:28:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h28m59s">of a nice downhill trip.</a>
00:28:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h29m01s">You have to think that, and so what happens
is you build this monster in your head.</a>
00:29:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h29m05s">It’s full of lies and rationalizations,
and they are whatever lies and rationalizations</a>
00:29:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h29m11s">allowed you to continue the behavior to begin
with.</a>
00:29:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h29m15s">But you're making them more and more potent,
and so you build a sub personality inside</a>
00:29:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h29m20s">of you that it’s a one eyed monster, fundamentally.</a>
00:29:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h29m25s">All it wants is the drug, and it’s armed
with any number of perfectly, depends on how</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h29m32s">smart you are, you know.</a>
00:29:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h29m33s">You can come up with a very powerful, nihilistic
rational argument why - about why life is</a>
00:29:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h29m41s">futile and your future is dead and there's

00:29:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h29m50s">Like you can conjure up a very - an argument
that’s virtually impermeable to rational</a>

00:29:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h30m03s">Because you know, there's some things that
you just can't prove.</a>
00:30:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h30m05s">Like you can't prove life is intrinsically

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h30m14s">So, now the reason I told you that is because
I think it’s a good example of how things</a>
00:30:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h30m20s">are nested inside of each other you know,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h30m38s">and not the way you expect because that's

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h30m54s">You want things to go the way you want them
to go, and if it’s just expectation then</a>
00:30:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h30m59s">it’s just a cold, cognitive model of the
world right.</a>
00:30:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h31m02s">It’s like robotic.</a>
00:31:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h31m03s">Okay, A happened, now B should happen.</a>
00:31:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h31m06s">Now C should happen.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h31m07s">It’s like that isn't how you think at all.</a>
00:31:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h31m09s">You're always inside a motivational frame,
and it isn't only that you expect the next</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h31m13s">thing to happen, but if the next thing happens,
it matters whether it’s what you want or</a>
00:31:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h31m19s">not.</a>
00:31:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h31m20s">If it’s what you want, then that little
system is reinforced.</a>
00:31:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h31m24s">It’s pleasurable for you, and then the whole
hierarchy grows a little bit stronger, and</a>
00:31:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h31m29s">if it is not what you want then you have a
problem.</a>
00:31:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h31m34s">And that's where things get weird and interesting.</a>
00:31:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h31m37s">So okay, so you're going along from point
A to point B, and you can see tools and you</a>
00:31:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h31m43s">can see obstacles, and obstacles are anything
that get in your path.</a>
00:31:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h31m47s">What that means in some sense is that what
a tool is and what an obstacle is switches</a>
00:31:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h31m51s">very rapidly as you change focus, and as your
intent changes.</a>
00:31:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h31m55s">So it’s a dynamic system.</a>
00:31:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h31m57s">Alright, and so the way emotion works in this
regard is if things are going the way you</a>
00:31:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h32m03s">want them to then you feel positive emotion
and that keeps you moving towards your goal,</a>
00:32:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h32m08s">and if you run into an obstacle, then you
feel negative emotion.</a>
00:32:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h32m12s">Okay so, the next issue might be well just
exactly what should you experience when you</a>
00:32:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h32m19s">experience negative emotion?</a>
00:32:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h32m21s">Well you might say well that's a tricky question
because if you encounter an obstacle, that</a>
00:32:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h32m30s">means that something about your model is wrong
because if it was right, you wouldn't have</a>
00:32:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h32m35s">encountered that obstacle.</a>
00:32:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h32m36s">So this is a very interesting way of thinking.</a>
00:32:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h32m38s">It’s a pragmatic way of thinking because
what it illustrates is that whenever you do</a>
00:32:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h32m44s">something, you're acting out a theory of truth,
and the theory of truth is the actions that</a>
00:32:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h32m52s">I’m undertaking at the moment are sufficient
to reach the goal that I’m aiming at, and</a>
00:32:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h32m57s">so you set up a theory of truth with each
act.</a>
00:32:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h33m02s">So, you're always struck with the reality
of truth and error or correct and incorrect</a>
00:33:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h33m09s">because you can't posit that a goal is worth
having, and if there's a path to it that might</a>
00:33:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h33m17s">be clear or obstructed without also saying
it matters whether you know what you're doing.</a>
00:33:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h33m23s">Okay, so you hit an obstacle, and that produces
negative emotion.</a>
00:33:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h33m31s">Now, the problem you have here is that in
principle, the reason you hit that obstacle</a>
00:33:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h33m38s">could be that there's an error in your nested
model at any level of the model.</a>
00:33:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h33m44s">So and that's why I told you about the little
story of the sun.</a>
00:33:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h33m47s">It’s like normally you just turn your computer
on and off because something has happened</a>
00:33:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h33m52s">that’s local, but now and then your problem
is that the sun isn't as reliable as you might</a>
00:33:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h33m57s">like it to be.</a>
00:33:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h33m59s">And so, you're faced with this insanely complex
problem not when things go right because when</a>
00:33:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h34m05s">things go right, you can just continue ignoring
everything that you’re ignoring, but when</a>
00:34:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h34m09s">they go wrong, the search space that opens
up before you is just about infinite.</a>
00:34:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h34m15s">Now, that has real world consequences.</a>
00:34:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h34m18s">I mean, one of the things that happens when
people develop panic disorder - what seems</a>
00:34:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h34m23s">to happen is that…</a>
00:34:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h34m24s">I can tell you the typical story about how
you would develop panic disorder with agoraphobia</a>
00:34:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h34m29s">cause the two things are somewhat separate.</a>
00:34:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h34m31s">So generally this happens to - it generally
happens to women.</a>
00:34:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h34m35s">It generally happens in their forties.</a>
00:34:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h34m37s">Women are more susceptible to anxiety and
depression, and men are more susceptible to</a>
00:34:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h34m43s">substance abuse and antisocial behavior.</a>
00:34:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h34m50s">Figures that something would go wrong right
now doesn't it?</a>
00:34:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h34m52s">Okay, so now what do I ask myself?</a>
00:34:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h34m55s">Well, is this relevant.</a>
00:34:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h34m57s">Is it going to disrupt the class?</a>
00:34:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h34m59s">Does it mean that there's something wrong
with my computer?</a>
00:34:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h35m03s">Should I call the help people?</a>
00:35:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h35m05s">And I’ll say no we’ll ignore it on the
assumption it will continue working, and until</a>
00:35:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h35m12s">that hypothesis fails then we can ignore it.</a>
00:35:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h35m15s">Okay so…</a>
00:35:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h35m18s">So something goes wrong and this search space
opens up in front of you.</a>
00:35:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h35m22s">Now okay, back to the agoraphobic.</a>
00:35:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h35m23s">So what happens to her usually is generally
these are people who’ve had dependant relationships</a>
00:35:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h35m29s">and perhaps they had a relatively overprotective
family, or let’s just say protective family,</a>
00:35:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h35m37s">and then they had an intimate relationship
early in their life and maybe that lasted</a>
00:35:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h35m43s">quite a long time or maybe they're just married
to the same guy, but the - and inside that</a>
00:35:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h35m50s">relationship, she’s relatively dependant
which means probably she doesn't go anywhere</a>
00:35:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h35m55s">without her husband, you know, she doesn't
do a lot of things autonomously let’s say.</a>
00:35:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h36m00s">Okay, so then she hits menopause and you know,
she’s getting some strange physiological</a>
00:36:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h36m10s">symptoms from that of various sorts.</a>
00:36:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h36m14s">And maybe at the same time, maybe she talks
to her husband about a divorce or maybe he</a>
00:36:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h36m20s">talks to her about a divorce or maybe her
sister gets divorced or maybe a close friend</a>
00:36:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h36m25s">dies or maybe she starts to experience heart
palpitations because of the menopause.</a>
00:36:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h36m33s">And then she thinks, “Oh my god.</a>
00:36:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h36m37s">That could happen to me.</a>
00:36:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h36m39s">It’s like my whole world can fall apart.”</a>
00:36:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h36m42s">So that’s one fear.</a>
00:36:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h36m43s">“My whole world could fall apart.”</a>
00:36:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h36m45s">So that's sort of the fear of societal catastrophe
- the collapse of the structure.</a>
00:36:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h36m50s">And then the other fear is often, “Oh my
god.</a>
00:36:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h36m53s">I could be dying of a heart attack.”</a>
00:36:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h36m54s">And so what happens to people who start to
develop panic disorder is that they end up</a>
00:36:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h36m59s">going to the emergency room all the time to
be checked out by cardiologists, and the cardiologists</a>
00:36:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h37m04s">are used to this, and they generally check
people up quite extensively but most of the</a>
00:37:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h37m08s">time if there's something up with your heart,
there's nothing wrong.</a>
00:37:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h37m12s">But there could be, and so then the sort of…
what happens is the person who is developed</a>
00:37:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h37m23s">agoraphobia starts thinking perhaps about
what would happen if her husband died or if</a>
00:37:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h37m29s">they got divorced, and then she starts thinking
about the fact that well she doesn't really</a>
00:37:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h37m33s">know what she’d do, and she doesn't really
know how to take care of a bunch of things</a>
00:37:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h37m37s">and how she might take care of the finances
and so forth.</a>
00:37:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h37m40s">And so, she has no real place to turn, and
so then she makes the fatal mistake.</a>
00:37:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h37m49s">She goes out and she starts to panic, and
then she goes home.</a>
00:37:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h37m53s">That's not good.</a>
00:37:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h37m54s">So if you ever develop severe anxiety, the
one thing you don't want to do is avoid because</a>
00:37:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h38m00s">of it because as soon as you avoid because
of it, it gets worse, and the reason for that</a>
00:38:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h38m05s">is imagine her anxiety systems are trying
to figure out how afraid she should be, and</a>
00:38:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h38m10s">it ranges from panic stricken to none.</a>
00:38:10</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h39m40s">And so then the bear probably won't think

00:46:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h46m06s">And the answer to that generally is by becoming

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h46m12s">help people do that is teach them there are

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h46m20s">And generally, people learn this quite quickly,
you know, and so the psychoanalysts believe</a>
00:46:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h46m27s">that if you just - this was their early criticisms
of behavioral exposure was that, you know,</a>
00:46:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h46m33s">if you expose someone who’s afraid, say,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h46m39s">other fears or maybe the fear will be substituted
somewhere else because it’s just symptomatic.</a>
00:46:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h46m44s">But that didn't work.</a>
00:46:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h46m45s">It’s not right, and it’s because when
you expose someone to an elevator, you're</a>
00:46:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h46m51s">not exposing them to an elevator.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h46m52s">If they're afraid of that elevator, you're

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h46m57s">So the elevator, you could say well the reason
behavioral exposure works - and it generalizes</a>
00:46:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h47m03s">- is because it’s not easy to specify what
the stimulus is.</a>
00:47:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h47m09s">I mean, when I’m in front of an elevator,
it’s an elevator.</a>
00:47:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h47m12s">When someone with agoraphobia is in front
of an elevator, it’s not an elevator.</a>
00:47:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h47m18s">That’s the problem.</a>
00:47:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h47m19s">If it was just an elevator, they’d just
get on it and away they go.</a>
00:47:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h47m22s">So you know, I had one client who was afraid
of elevators and the elevator opened up and</a>
00:47:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h47m26s">she said, “That’s a tomb.”</a>
00:47:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h47m28s">And it was just an immediate response, you
know, but you could say well that was the</a>
00:47:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h47m32s">symbolic representation that came to mind,
but you could also say that well there are</a>
00:47:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h47m39s">similarities between an elevator and a tomb,
and you can get trapped inside an elevator</a>
00:47:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h47m42s">and you could get trapped inside an elevator
and die in which case it would be a tomb,</a>
00:47:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h47m47s">and the logical conclusion from that is that
everything could be a tomb.</a>
00:47:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h47m51s">So you might think, “Well the stimulus isn’t
tomb.”</a>
00:47:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h47m54s">Like yeah, yeah.</a>
00:47:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h47m55s">Wrong.</a>
00:47:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h47m56s">It can be tomb.</a>
00:47:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h47m57s">It’s unlikely, but then you might also ask
yourself this.</a>
00:47:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h48m04s">If the chance that you're going to die somewhere
is a hundred thousand to one, should you be</a>

00:48:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h48m10s">And well the answer to that is dying is of
infinite magnitude, and if you multiply one</a>
00:48:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h48m16s">and a hundred thousand by infinite magnitude,
you get a very very large number.</a>
00:48:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h48m21s">And so one of the things that makes you wonder
is why the hell are people terrified out of</a>
00:48:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h48m25s">their skin all the time?</a>
00:48:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h48m27s">That is a very good question because by no
means obvious that people aren’t, and I</a>
00:48:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h48m32s">actually think - I often think that the mystery
with a condition like agoraphobia isn't that</a>
00:48:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h48m37s">some people have agoraphobia.</a>
00:48:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h48m39s">It’s that everyone doesn't have it all the

00:48:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h48m43s">So because - and you know the terror management
people talk about this too is that because</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h48m47s">we’re always confronting our own mortality

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h49m15s">I think a lot of it is that we imitate other

00:49:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h49m36s">There's a child two years old and there's

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h49m52s">Well because something anomalous has occurred,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h50m09s">And mum is thinking, “Oh that’s a mouse,”

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h51m24s">Now, this is changed a little bit.</a>
00:51:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h51m26s">So you're going from point A to point B, and
what can happen?</a>
00:51:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h51m30s">Well you can encounter tools and you can encounter
obstacles and you can zero almost everything</a>
00:51:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h51m34s">out.</a>
00:51:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h51m35s">But you can look at it this way too.</a>
00:51:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h51m37s">When you're moving forward, you can encounter
what you predict.</a>
00:51:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h51m41s">That should really be desired rather than
predictiveness in the old diagram, or you</a>
00:51:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h51m45s">can encounter something that you didn't predict
or desire, and if you encounter something</a>
00:51:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h51m52s">that you predict and desire, then you have
positive emotion and we know why that is.</a>
00:51:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h51m56s">You're getting to where you want to go and
it validates the whole structure.</a>
00:51:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h51m59s">But then, you run into something unpredicted.</a>
00:51:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h52m02s">Well then, you get - that’s a threat and
you get anxious.</a>
00:52:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h52m09s">Well you also get exploratory.</a>
00:52:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h52m13s">So then you might say well, how anxious do
you get and how exploratory do you get, and</a>
00:52:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h52m17s">I would say it’s proportional - imagine
the hierarchy again.</a>
00:52:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h52m23s">If you feel that it’s just an inconvenience
that you can make a mild alteration and direct</a>
00:52:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h52m31s">action and go over, you'll be mildly inconvenienced
and maybe you’ll be a bit curious, but what</a>
00:52:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h52m37s">happens is that as your suspicion that the
error is occurring at higher and higher and</a>
00:52:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h52m43s">broader and broader levels in the hierarchy,
the probability that you're going to be anxious,</a>
00:52:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h52m49s">and quite anxious compared to exploratory
at least initially, starts to mount.</a>
00:52:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h52m54s">So, and then, all those other factors also
play a role.</a>
00:52:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h52m58s">You know, your social status, your neuroticism,
your sense of self competence.</a>
00:52:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h53m03s">How much you've explored all those other things
is a very complicated thing to address, and</a>
00:53:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h53m10s">so alright.</a>
00:53:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h53m12s">So then you're going to concentrate on what
happens if you experience an unpredicted outcome</a>
00:53:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h53m18s">because here's the complicated question.</a>
00:53:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h53m20s">If you experience an unpredicted outcome,
then you have a weird problem.</a>
00:53:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h53m25s">The problem is that you have to figure out
what to do about something that you don't</a>
00:53:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h53m30s">know what to do about, and that’s a big
problem.</a>
00:53:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h53m39s">So...let’s start with this one.</a>
00:53:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h53m50s">Alright so, you're going.</a>
00:53:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h53m54s">You're in the top left hand corner.</a>
00:53:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h53m55s">You're in this little frame, and you're going
from point A to point B, and you encounter</a>
00:53:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h54m01s">- I’m calling it now - an anomaly, and anomaly
is something that shouldn't be according to</a>
00:54:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h54m07s">your model of the world.</a>
00:54:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h54m10s">Now, what that does is it destabilizes that
model at some level of resolution.</a>
00:54:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h54m16s">Now what we’re assuming here is that this
is a relatively high order disruption.</a>
00:54:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h54m23s">Okay so I can give you some examples of that.</a>
00:54:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h54m25s">The heart palpitation example was a good one
cause that'll kind of unglue you.</a>
00:54:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h54m31s">Maybe you take your child to the hospital
because they have a minor illness and you</a>
00:54:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h54m34s">find out that they don't have a minor illness,
they have a major illness, or you find that</a>
00:54:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h54m38s">out about yourself or you find that about
your partner, or maybe the stock market crashes</a>
00:54:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h54m42s">or you have a car accident or you write the
MCAT and you end up in the twenty fifth percentile</a>
00:54:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h54m47s">like the quarter of the people who take it
do, and then all of a sudden bang.</a>
00:54:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h54m52s">You're not where you thought you were, and
you're not going to where you thought where</a>
00:54:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h54m55s">you were going and you don't know what the
hell's going on, and that can be as we said,</a>
00:54:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h55m01s">a small revolution.</a>
00:55:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h55m03s">You just have to make a detour around it,
or it can just sucker punch you, and that's</a>
00:55:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h55m08s">as far as I've been able to determine, that's
Alice down the rabbit hole.</a>
00:55:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h55m13s">That's a descent to the underworld, and what's
down in the underworld?</a>
00:55:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h55m16s">Well partly what’s down - everything is
down there in the underworld, and the reason</a>
00:55:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h55m22s">for that...it’s very complicated but part
of the reason is that when things fall apart,</a>
00:55:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h55m29s">you don't get to ignore things anymore because
you had this model that told you what was</a>
00:55:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h55m34s">relevant in the world and what wasn't and
the real important part of that model was</a>
00:55:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h55m39s">that it told you what wasn't relevant, and
then all of a sudden something pops up and</a>
00:55:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h55m44s">takes you down.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h55m45s">It’s like everything's relevant.</a>

00:56:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h56m27s">complexity is like a journey through a maze

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h56m32s">It’s a branching maze, and so what you'll

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h57m14s">Well obviously it’s stressful.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=00h57m15s">It means you have an infinite journey towards

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h05m54s">Well, I would say for the sake of argument
that you might as well define it two ways.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h06m00s">You might as well use the standard Newtonian

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h07m04s">Okay so here we are.</a>
01:07:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h07m05s">We’ve been evolving for three and a half

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h07m18s">Well, you've got seventy years.</a>

01:07:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h07m42s">Now then you might say, well what does right

01:07:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h07m45s">Well, from the Darwinian perspective, from
some sense there's no other right than that</a>

01:07:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h07m56s">Okay so let’s say that's your pragmatic
definition of right.</a>
01:07:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h08m01s">Well then what that means is if that is right,
as far as right can be determined, as far</a>
01:08:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h08m06s">as being human is concerned, then when you
are reacting by fleeing or freezing when something</a>
01:08:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h08m16s">terrible is chasing you because you perceive

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h08m25s">It’s like if you didn't perceive a predator

01:08:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h08m30s">so I think - you know, you can think of the
Darwinian world as nested inside the Newtonian</a>

01:08:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h08m39s">I think it’s the other way around.</a>
01:08:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h08m41s">I think the Darwinian world is the ultimate
world in a sense, and the Newtonian world</a>
01:08:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h08m47s">is just a tiny subset of that and it’s a
useful subset.</a>
01:08:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h08m50s">It’s a tool.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h08m51s">It’s useful subset, but the real world - the

a way out of that argument.</a>
01:08:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h09m03s">So, I mean it depends to a large - Yup.</a>
01:09:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h09m05s">So are you saying that - cause I’m trying

01:09:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h09m39s">Are you saying that like our estimations of
like the deterministic, material world is</a>
01:09:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h09m40s">nested in an evolutionary drive to find truth

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h09m42s">Yeah, so well here's another example.</a>
01:09:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h09m43s">You guys can think about this for a minute

01:09:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h09m44s">So, let’s say that one of the logical consequences
of pursuing science from a Newtonian perspective</a>
01:09:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h09m51s">is that you learn how to create - cross ebola

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h10m00s">It’s like, how’s that for a validation

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h10m04s">You know, it’s like - because this could

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h10m09s">Our technological capability which is fostered

apart from that, it was right.”</a>
01:10:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h10m23s">And then I’d think it’s a tricky argument
because okay let's say - but here's part of</a>
01:10:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h10m29s">the problem, and I also thought the same thing
about hydrogen bombs.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h10m32s">It’s like well obviously the quantum view,
let’s say, is accurate because if you follow</a>
01:10:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h10m37s">it you can make a hydrogen bomb.</a>

have to treat the matter that you're interacting</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h12m16s">So that's why Newtonian physics is nested

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h12m25s">Because it’s just an estimation whereas

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h12m31s">Yeah, whereas the Newtonian perspective comes
out of a rough estimation of what reality</a>

01:12:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h12m41s">Well Jung, when Jung was talking about the
origin of the scientific mindset, you know,</a>
01:12:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h12m47s">he traced its development back to alchemy.</a>
01:12:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h12m50s">Here’s another reason why the scientific
mindset is necessarily nested in the mythological</a>
01:12:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h12m55s">mindset.</a>
01:12:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h12m56s">So what the alchemists were trying to do is
mess around with matter and to produce something.</a>
01:12:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h13m03s">They argued for centuries what this thing
was.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h13m29s">Okay, now what Jung said - and we’ll talk
about this.</a>
01:13:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h13m32s">If I have enough energy, we’ll talk about
this two-thirds of the way through class because</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h13m36s">it’s so damn complicated that some years
I can't muster up enough energy to discuss</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h13m40s">it, but Jung believed that, you know, people
have always been trying to cope with their</a>
01:13:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h13m48s">mortality, right, and their vulnerability.</a>
01:13:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h13m50s">Okay, fine, and that makes perfect sense.</a>
01:13:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h13m52s">So he did an analysis of Western history,
roughly speaking, and said well what happened</a>
01:13:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h13m58s">- there was a Christian epoch, maybe, that
lasted around 1,600 years, roughly speaking,</a>
01:13:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h14m03s">and there was an idea at the base of it and
the idea was that through spiritual discipline,</a>
01:14:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h14m11s">man could transcend suffering, but - the problem
with that was that all this suffering kept</a>
01:14:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h14m17s">happening, and you know, and there was some
warps in the idea, as Nietzsche pointed out</a>
01:14:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h14m22s">how this ceasing of suffering was only going
to happen after you die.</a>
01:14:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h14m29s">Okay fine, then you live forever in bliss,
but still there's like black plague and babies</a>
01:14:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h14m34s">dying and crops failing, and it’s like it
just doesn't seem that you can just ignore</a>
01:14:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h14m38s">that, and so you've got 1,500 or 1,600 years
of Christianity, and you know, the whole history</a>
01:14:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h14m44s">of Christianity behind that grinding away
on this problem trying to produce a system</a>
01:14:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h14m49s">of redemption, and it doesn't work or it works
partially.</a>
01:14:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h14m56s">And it also ignores certain things.</a>
01:14:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h14m57s">So partly what it ignores, you know, one of
the presuppositions of, say, medieval Christianity</a>
01:14:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h15m02s">is that the world, roughly speaking, is an
evil place, and that matter is corrupt and</a>
01:15:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h15m08s">unworthy of attention.</a>
01:15:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h15m09s">Well, one of Jung’s hypothesis is that if
you ignore something long enough, then it</a>
01:15:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h15m14s">starts to demand your attention, you know.</a>
01:15:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h15m17s">It’s like a repression, and then that's
especially the case if there's a problem that</a>
01:15:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h15m23s">you're trying to solve that your current worldview
isn't really solving.</a>
01:15:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h15m26s">It’s like your attention is going to be
drawn unconsciously to that which you've ignored</a>
01:15:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h15m31s">and put down, and so Jung saw the development
of alchemy as a parallel to the development</a>
01:15:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h15m38s">of Christianity, but alchemy studied matter,
which was forbidden in a sense.</a>
01:15:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h15m44s">It was damned from the Christian perspective.</a>
01:15:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h15m47s">The alchemists were studying the transmutations
of matter.</a>
01:15:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h15m51s">They had an intuition that there was information
locked in that.</a>
01:15:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h15m54s">In matter.</a>
01:15:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h15m55s">And that if you could just figure out how
to interact with it properly, then you can</a>
01:15:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h15m59s">free up the information, and they symbolized
that in the dreamlike manner.</a>
01:15:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h16m03s">The dreamlike manner was you could discover
the philosopher’s stone and that would give</a>
01:16:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h16m07s">you, you know, wealth, health, and eternal
life.</a>
01:16:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h16m11s">Well as far as Jung was concerned, that was
a dream, and it was like an artistic production.</a>
01:16:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h16m17s">It was like the scaffolding of the scientific
perspective because it isn't like people went</a>
01:16:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h16m22s">from medieval Christianity to full fledged
scientists like overnight.</a>
01:16:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h16m26s">It took hundreds of years for this to occur.</a>
01:16:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h16m30s">There were changes in the substrata of thought
that were occurring as this was happening</a>
01:16:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h16m34s">and Jung traced that back more than 1,600
years in the development of alchemy.</a>
01:16:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h16m39s">And so, the dream of alchemy was that you
could discover - you could master the transmutations</a>
01:16:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h16m44s">of matter such that there would be no disease,
that no one would die, and everyone was wealthy.</a>
01:16:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h16m49s">Well okay that, as far as Jung was concerned,
that provided the motivation for science because</a>
01:16:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h16m55s">one of the things you might ask is well, why
do people do science.</a>
01:16:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h16m59s">I mean, most people never have right.</a>
01:16:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h17m02s">It’s not very old.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h26m24s">then you think, well out of that emerges a

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h26m44s">You might think, well what do you have to

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h26m49s">Well, at some point, your beliefs run out

01:26:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h26m58s">And most people have about five reasons, and

01:26:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h27m02s">So what that means is they have reason A,
and reason B, and reason C, and reason D,</a>
01:27:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h27m07s">and then they're just acting it out after
that, and if you keep questioning them, they</a>
01:27:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h27m12s">get perturbed and they'll get annoyed.</a>
01:27:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h27m14s">Sometimes they'll cry.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h27m15s">Sometimes they'll get angry, like if you're

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h27m20s">You know, sometimes you have to do that to
untangle something very complex.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h27m24s">At some point, people just - they get angry

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h27m28s">or you're bullying me, leave me alone, and
that's supposed to get rid of you, you know,</a>
01:27:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h27m32s">but it doesn't work if you really want to

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h27m36s">Well, partly what we’re trying to figure
out is why the hell are you in university?</a>
01:27:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h27m39s">You might say, “Well, to get a job,” but
I might say, “Well why in the world would</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h27m49s">better than not having a job.”</a>
01:27:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h27m50s">It’s like yeah yeah fair enough, you know,
like right let’s not forget the practical,</a>
01:27:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h27m54s">but it isn't the solution.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h27m57s">It’s part of a solution, and the question
is do you really believe there's a solution?</a>
01:27:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h28m02s">Well you must because you believe it enough
so that you're here, and then you believe</a>
01:28:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h28m07s">that has something to do with the ability
to think - and you believe that has something</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h28m12s">to do with the necessity of understanding
your history and you believe that it has something</a>

01:28:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h28m24s">You assume that that's all valid because even
if it’s implicitly, if it’s implicitly,</a>
01:28:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h28m29s">it means you're imitating someone who assumes
all that, but either way here you are.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h28m34s">You're doing something, and the questions
is - and maybe this is the critical, I think</a>
01:28:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h28m37s">this was the critical question of the 20th
century.</a>
01:28:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h28m41s">Is there any reality to what you are doing,
or is it just arbitrary?</a>
01:28:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h28m45s">If it’s arbitrary, well you know that's
a path to nihilism because who cares what</a>
01:28:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h28m51s">you do?</a>
01:28:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h28m53s">Whatever you do, you're ruined.</a>
01:28:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h28m55s">You can make a strong case for that, you know.</a>
01:28:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h28m57s">But the problem with that seems to be nihilism
- try it for a while, you know.</a>
01:28:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h29m03s">What it produces is misery, and people generally
believe in misery, and they generally believe</a>
01:29:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h29m09s">that it’s not a good thing to have, and
so I would say nihilism is a self defeating</a>
01:29:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h29m13s">proposition if you assume that misery is actually
a source of valid information, and you all</a>
01:29:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h29m18s">do because you know, if someone is jabbing
you with a pen, you're going to move you arm</a>
01:29:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h29m24s">because you feel that if you can avoid some
misery, that's a good thing.</a>
01:29:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h29m28s">So you have faith in your experience at that

01:29:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h29m31s">Well then you might say well you know, if
you can really make a solid case for the believability</a>
01:29:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h29m37s">for certain kinds of experiences, that they're
real, why can't you make a case for the believability</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h29m41s">for higher forms of meaning?</a>
01:29:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h29m43s">Maybe they're not arbitrary.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h29m45s">We don't know, but I tell you if you act like
they're arbitrary, you get into trouble very,</a>
01:29:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h29m50s">very rapidly because you either become nihilistic
or halfway down the trip to nihilism, you</a>
01:29:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h29m55s">adopt some horrible ideology and then you
know, you're possessed by it, and then you're</a>
01:29:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h30m00s">well - then you're not going to live your
own life because you're going to live the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h30m05s">life of the ideology and you're going to be
dangerous to everyone around you and also</a>
01:30:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h30m09s">impervious to any sort of reasonable communication.</a>
01:30:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h30m12s">So if those are the two consequences of making
the presumption of arbitrary meaning at a</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h30m17s">higher order level, then to me, they've invalidated
themselves already.</a>
01:30:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h30m20s">We’ve already had that experiment.</a>
01:30:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h30m22s">It didn't work.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h30m24s">And so then the question is well what's next?</a>
01:30:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYqkPrCvXQ#t=01h30m26s">Well that’s partly what we’re trying to
