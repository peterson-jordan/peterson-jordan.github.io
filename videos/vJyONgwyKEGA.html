<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h00m45s">2008 where she produced a series of animated shorts above intellectual freedom called minute memes</a>
00:00:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h00m51s">More recently she made this land is mine, which is absolutely brilliant</a>
00:00:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h00m57s">shocking</a>

00:00:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h01m01s">and also aesthetically impressive film</a>
00:01:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h01m04s">About Israel Palestine and Canaan the Levant and that's intended for her new feature film</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h01m15s">pieces of pieces of that film online and I would highly recommend</a>
00:01:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h01m20s">Watching them. We'll</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h01m21s">Cut a couple of them into this interview so that you can see what she's up to</a>
00:01:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h01m25s">So I guess there's two things that we could really talk about</a>
00:01:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h01m28s">I think the most important one obviously is your work, but I guess the second one is your</a>
00:01:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h01m36s">Concern for intellectual freedom and your your feeling with regards to two copyrights</a>
00:01:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h01m47s">Copying is not that</a>
00:01:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h01m49s">Stealing a thing leaves one less left copying. It makes one thing more. That's what copies for</a>
00:01:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h01m58s">Copying is not set</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h02m00s">Goodbye, copied yours who have it blue one for me and one for you. That's what copies can do</a>
00:02:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h02m11s">To take</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h02m14s">I just copy it. There's one for each of us. We're making more up a thing</a>
00:02:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h02m21s">That is what we call copying sharing ideas with everyone. That's why copying is</a>
00:02:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h02m32s">But let's let's start let's start by talking about you first</a>
00:02:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h02m37s">Tell tell my listeners and tell me who you are and where you come from and and what you're about</a>
00:02:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h02m46s">You want to know about my identity I guess yeah, trust me to identify</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h02m51s">Myself, I don't trust myself there. Well, okay. You're the best source we have today</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h02m57s">actually, I'm</a>
00:02:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h02m59s">Not sure about that</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h03m02s">I mean, I think most of us would agree that I'm an artist and</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h03m08s">Currently an animator. I guess I've been doing animation since 1998</a>
00:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h03m14s">Before that I was a newspaper cartoonist. I still do comics from time to time not very often. I</a>
00:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h03m23s">Mean, I guess the thing is I've just been I just came back from a bike ride</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h03m26s">And I've just been thinking about identity like all the time and how incredibly unreliable it is and how I don't respect it</a>
00:03:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h03m32s">including ways that I identify myself</a>
00:03:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h03m35s">Well, I guess that's part of being an artist, you know, because people who are artistic or high in trade openness</a>
00:03:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h03m41s">And that gives them a very fluid identity us</a>
00:03:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h03m44s">I mean, it's an advantage because people who are high in openness can think laterally and they're always coming coming up with creative ideas</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h03m50s">But it does tend to make their identity rather pluralistic and and and sometimes unstable and that can also be a problem</a>
00:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h03m58s">Well, I guess I guess it's not even that it's fluid</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h04m01s">It's not like oh, I don't identify this way one day in this way another day. It's just I don't really</a>
00:04:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h04m07s">Currently have much respect for the idea of identity at all</a>
00:04:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h04m12s">And I could you know, say all kinds of things about myself but you know, does that actually do me any good?</a>
00:04:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h04m19s">Well, let me ask you a couple of basic questions. Where do you live?</a>
00:04:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h04m23s">Good. I live in Urbana, Illinois. That's verifiable. All right, and where were you born?</a>
00:04:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h04m28s">I was born in Urbana, Illinois were so you've been there your whole life, essentially? No I left</a>
00:04:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h04m34s">I was twenty I moved to Santa Cruz California. I wanted to be a hippie I failed</a>
00:04:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h04m40s">But then, you know, I was already out on my own so I briefly moved to Austin Texas didn't work out</a>
00:04:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h04m46s">I moved to San Francisco in 1991. I lived there for 11 years in 2002. I followed my then-boyfriend</a>
00:04:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h04m54s">Actually, we were legally married. So my then-husband to India</a>
00:04:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h04m58s">which is the subject one of the subjects of Sita sings the blues' and</a>
00:04:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h05m03s">Then later in 2002</a>
00:05:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h05m04s">I moved to Brooklyn New York and lived in various places in New York for a total of about ten years</a>
00:05:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h05m09s">I moved back to her banner in 2012 right after my father died and</a>
00:05:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h05m15s">Here I am and so why did you move back to her van and after all that adventuring</a>
00:05:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h05m20s">First I was done with New York, even though I really loved New York, especially</a>
00:05:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h05m26s">You know my first five years there. I was fantastic. I kind of</a>
00:05:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h05m31s">achieved</a>
00:05:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h05m32s">more than I even expected I would be able to and</a>
00:05:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h05m36s">started to just get I don't know the love affair with New York kind of wore off and</a>
00:05:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h05m44s">I wanted a little more peace and quiet and I wanted cooler summers and I didn't want a small garbage everywhere all the time</a>
00:05:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h05m51s">I had an opportunity to move back here because my dad died. My mom was threatening to sell the house</a>
00:05:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h05m56s">I joined the Occupy movement</a>
00:05:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h06m00s">occupy mom's house</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h06m02s">Trying to keep her from something the house, but so you actually have a specific demand</a>
00:06:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h06m12s">She sold the house anyway, but I'm living in her new house. Oh</a>
00:06:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h06m17s">yeah, I was I was dating somebody that lived here and</a>
00:06:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h06m21s">That has ended but I actually really like it. It's much more relaxed and</a>
00:06:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h06m27s">Inexpensive, I get lots of fresh air. I take lots of bike rides and I don't really care about</a>
00:06:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h06m34s">the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h06m35s">I'm just less stressed out</a>
00:06:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h06m38s">Yeah, good any less? Yes</a>
00:06:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h06m40s">Well, you have plenty of adventures obviously</a>
00:06:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h06m42s">so I guess and it must take a fair bit of I would think time of quiet and and</a>
00:06:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h06m49s">Some isolation in order to work on your animation</a>
00:06:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h06m52s">Yeah, well, I achieved that quite an isolation in New York actually by just living in New York and in a by myself</a>
00:06:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h07m00s">I would rather live in New York than visit New York because when you live there you can actually control</a>
00:07:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h07m06s">Your environment somewhat and you can shut everything out. Whereas when you're visiting usually have to be out all the time being overstimulated, right?</a>
00:07:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h07m13s">Yes, well, it's definitely an over stimulating place</a>
00:07:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h07m17s">Yeah, when did you start doing your animation? I?</a>
00:07:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h07m21s">Started animating as an adult in 1998 before that</a>
00:07:21</p>

00:15:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h15m08s">so I knew I wanted to make a movie about Passover because I was raised observing Passover, although not much else and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h15m18s">So I was doing research I had never seen the movie Exodus you know that movie</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h15m50s">so the absurdity of it was just a parent in the song and</a>

00:26:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h26m41s">I mean you seem to be treating the stories with a tremendous amount of respect. And so</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h29m40s">It's just a long drawn-out meditation on it and sometimes insights can pop up while you're working on it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h29m50s">there are insights that I have one of them a lot of them are comparative religion insights because the previous film was Sita sings the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h30m25s">But anyway, I showed Aaron in this and I thought about how both stories have these brothers</a>
00:30:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h30m30s">Have like the big important memorable brother and the other brother who?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h30m49s">I'd always thought a story was, you know, the Hebrews were slaves and then</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h30m57s">They were free. Right like the end is they're free. They crossed the Red Sea to get away from the Egyptians hooray</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h31m02s">And of course what actually happens in the story after that is there's this Hebrew on Hebrew slaughter</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h31m09s">Because of the golden calf and a whole bunch of those Hebrews who were liberated they die</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h33m43s">One of the things that you can say about the Old Testament is that it's not naively optimistic in any sense of the word</a>

00:33:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h33m53s">kind of is as its as people observe it like when you read the Passover story, it's just this nice part and</a>
00:33:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h34m02s">That like I say that other part that later chapter, we never discussed that it Passover</a>

00:34:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h34m12s">Like I did know that the Jews wandered the desert for 40 years. I didn't know they killed each other</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h34m17s">Right and and this is something similar to the Ramayana</a>
00:34:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h34m22s">Because the Ramayana is frequently told without the last chapter without the ohter. Akanda, which is the difficult part, right?</a>
00:34:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h34m28s">Which I think is the richest and most interesting part of the whole story</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h34m32s">So I focused on it and see if this thing's the blues</a>

00:34:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h34m47s">well, they are the most useful parts because life is full of difficulty and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h37m51s">It's against the religion to make art. You're not supposed to make graven images. So</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h38m20s">Right that that that art which actually moves me when I look at it is what we're supposed to smash, right?</a>
00:38:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h38m27s">Like that's that's what we're commanded to destroy because it's it's all full of idols</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h38m43s">tension there that I think is worth thinking about you know, because I</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h38m48s">Understand why from a psychological perspective. I understand why there was an injunction against making images and you know,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h38m56s">You see the same thing happened out right now with Isis say in the Middle East where they're destroying world</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h39m15s">well
So so the conundrum seems to me to be that</a>
00:39:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h39m18s">And this has also played out in the story of Exodus with the golden calf</a>

00:43:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h43m14s">well, it's a price and an advantage is that the people you eat with are your kinsmen and your tribesmen pretty much by definition and</a>

It certainly worked for a very long period of time and so that that would be an idea that's in keeping with that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h44m29s">You don't have to do this project cause you're Jewish. He never said you don't have to do the project because you're an atheist</a>
00:44:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h44m35s">Just because you're Jewish, right?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h44m37s">And so we maintain some sort of difference in spite of not actually practicing</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h44m47s">Well, it's one of the things that's always been interesting interesting to me about Judaism particularly and a mystery</a>
00:44:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h44m53s">I would say and you know, I think there are very many ways of believing in God and</a>

00:45:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h45m03s">that would be the sort of belief that you can state as I believe or I don't believe and</a>
00:45:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h45m09s">I think in some sense that's the weakest form of belief and it's also the one that's most easily undermined</a>
00:45:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h45m14s">I think the more profound forms of belief are ones that you act out</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h45m52s">it wouldn't be easy for me to mount an intellectual attack on that because</a>
00:45:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=00h45m56s">because of your use use of in some sense with the cutouts and your use of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=01h06m51s">Than would see them if I were trying to control them and trying to be people to pay me to see the things</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=01h08m15s">And I would say perhaps Disney is more responsible for that than any other organization, you know</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=01h08m20s">And so it was Disney that was instrumental in getting copyright extended from fifty to seventy-five years</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=01h08m27s">and I really did think that that was a form of crime because some of those early Disney movies and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=01h09m15s">What about patents and things like that? Do you think that they are technically different?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=01h10m05s">Right, right. So yeah</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=01h10m06s">Well, I mean part of it, I guess part of the claim for the protection of originality</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=01h10m10s">We might say is also the protection you could argue for for the Virginia witness, you know</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=01h10m16s">Like I might want to know that and maybe legal protection can help with this that I might want to know that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=01h10m43s">Yeah, I mean, but the thing is I don't have a lot of need for that largely because I do free my work</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=01h13m08s">Yeah, right because I think generally when you speak with artists you speak to the inferior part of them</a>
01:13:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyONgwyKEGA#t=01h13m14s">Not because their ego is inferior compared to the ego of other people</a>
