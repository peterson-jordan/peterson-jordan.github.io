00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h00m01s">theory, and you've got to get this exactly right to understand this properly you got to get it exactly right, and it's really important because</a>
00:00:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h00m09s">In so far as you guys are interested in psychology, especially in the experimental end of psychology measurement is everything and so much of what psychologists</a>
00:00:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h00m17s">Publish and write about is incorrect and the reason it's incorrect is because they do not have their measurements properly instantiate it</a>
00:00:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h00m24s">It's a massive problem, especially in Social Psychology. In fact</a>
00:00:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h00m28s">it's probably a fatal problem in that most of the things that social psychologists measure don't exist and</a>
00:00:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h00m34s">Social psychology has been rife with scandals for the last four or five years and and there's good reason for it</a>
00:00:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h00m39s">But a big part of the problem is is that the measurement that...</a>
00:00:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h00m43s">People are not stringent and careful enough about their measurements, so we're gonna walk through this very very carefully</a>
00:00:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h00m48s">So I'm gonna set forward a set of propositions, and you have to think about them because each of them are their axiomatic</a>
00:00:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h00m54s">So you sort of have to accept them before you go on to the next step and there's certainly room to question them</a>
00:00:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h00m59s">But here's the bare bones of the psychometric a model of personality, so we'll call it</a>
00:00:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h01m04s">Roughly the big five model and the reason it's called the big five model is because the psychometric</a>
00:01:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h01m09s">Investigations have indicated that you can specify human personality along five basic dimensions you might ask well</a>
00:01:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h01m17s">What exactly is personality and well that's partly what we've been trying to wrestle with the entire course so far and I would say</a>
00:01:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h01m24s">Or what exactly is a trait?</a>
00:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h01m27s">think of a trait as an element of personality</a>
00:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h01m29s">And I think the best way to think about a trait is as a sub personality</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h01m34s">So you're you're made up of sub personalities that are integrated into something vaguely resembling a unity but the unity is is</a>
00:01:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h01m42s">Diverse... there are.. there are... there are.. there are describable...</a>
00:01:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h01m46s">Stable elements that characterize you that are elements of your being so for example here's here's some common ones</a>
00:01:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h01m53s">I might say well, are you social or or would you rather be alone?</a>
00:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h01m56s">So here here's a good question for you to Define decide whether you're extroverted or introverted</a>
00:01:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h02m01s">It's pretty straight forward because that's that's the first major dimension</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h02m04s">basically if you take any set of questions about</a>
00:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h02m08s">Any any set of questions that could be applied descriptively to a human being?</a>
00:02:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h02m13s">and you subject them to a</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h02m16s">Statistical process called factor analysis, you can determine how they group together</a>
00:02:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h02m20s">So what I would be interested in let's say I ask you a hundred questions</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h02m23s">Let's say I asked a hundred questions of you and a hundred other people</a>
00:02:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h02m27s">what I would find was that reliably if some person answered question 'A' say on a scale of one to seven</a>
00:02:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h02m35s">Six or seven there would be other questions in the set of questions that they also tended to answer</a>
00:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h02m42s">on the upper end of the scale or</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h02m45s">Reliably if they answered one question at the top of the scale, they'd answer another question at the bottom that's a pattern of covariation</a>
00:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h02m52s">so you're looking for how the</a>
00:02:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h02m54s">Questions covary across large numbers of people so let's say here's a stupid example, but it's really it's really</a>
00:02:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h03m02s">straightforward easy to understand I might say</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h03m05s">How often do you smile one to seven?</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h03m08s">How often are you happy one to seven well what you'd find obviously is that?</a>
00:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h03m12s">people who tended to answer</a>
00:03:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h03m14s">that they smiled a lot would also tend to answer that they were happy a lot and so smiling and happy are not exactly the</a>
00:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h03m19s">Same thing which is why we'd have two different phrases to describe them</a>
00:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h03m23s">But they're close enough so that they seem to be reflective of some underlying structure, and so that's what a factor</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h03m30s">Analysis is does it allows you to take a large set of questions to administer it to a large number of people and then to</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h03m36s">Statistically analyze it looking how the questions relate to one another across the entire group so that you can infer</a>
00:03:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h03m43s">What the underlying structure is</a>
00:03:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h03m46s">Here's the question in some sense if I ask you a hundred questions how many questions am I really asking you?</a>
00:03:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h03m51s">Because you might say well, are you?</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h03m54s">Do you smile a lot? Are you happy?</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h03m57s">Do you wake up eager to start the day? you say well is that</a>
00:03:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h04m01s">one question</a>
00:04:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h04m03s">Asked three ways or is it three separate questions and the answer is well if the answer is</a>
00:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h04m10s">Reliably co-vary then it's reflection of an underlying single dimension now</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h04m16s">Obviously those questions are slightly different</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h04m18s">Now but they're they'll relate to one another stabily and so you can infer out the central</a>
00:04:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h04m24s">Stable Factors now it might be the case so here's here's an example</a>
00:04:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h04m30s">Because you might ask how many stable underlying dimensions are there in any set of questions if I ask you?</a>
00:04:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h04m36s">questions that relate to your capacity to manipulate</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h04m40s">abstractions, I'll find that there's one factor, so imagine you had an infinite library of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdBgRWkF-I#t=00h05m16s">Okay an infinite library and you took random sets of a hundred questions from that library and you gave that</a>
