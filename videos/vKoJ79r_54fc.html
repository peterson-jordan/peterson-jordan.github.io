<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h00m02s">Well, I think it looks something like this - and this is,
as far as I can tell, this is the barebones...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h00m07s">This is the barebones of a variety of things.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h00m09s">It's a barebone story.
It's a barebone conceptual framework.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h00m13s">It's a barebone "Dasein",
to speak in Heideggerian terms.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h00m19s">You're always in one of these worlds,
there's no getting out of them.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h00m26s">And so, this is the world that you're in.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h00m34s">Which means, that to [be] somewhere that you are, is chaotic.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h00m37s">In which case, you need to go over your past,
in great detail, and figure out where you are.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h00m42s">It's like you're lost, right? You- you're lost,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h00m45s">and the problem with being lost is:
when you're lost, you don't know where to go,</a>
00:00:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h00m48s">and the problem with not knowing where to go, is:
there's a million places, that you could go,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h00m52s">and a million places, is too many places for you to go, without dying.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h00m56s">So, being lost is not good.
So you need to know where you are.</a>
00:00:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h01m00s">One of the things that we built online, my partners and I,
is this program called "Past Authoring",</a>
00:01:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h01m06s">that helps people lay out, the-
the narrative of their past.</a>
00:01:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h01m11s">To identify... to break their life down into six stages - "epochs", we call them,</a>
00:01:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h01m16s">and then to identify the... emotionally significant moments in each epoch,</a>
00:01:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h01m21s">and to write them out:
what happened negatively, what happened positively.</a>
00:01:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h01m24s">What the consequences were,
what you derived from it,</a>
00:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h01m27s">perhaps what you could have done differently,
perhaps what you learned from it, all of that.</a>
00:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h01m30s">So that you could narrow in, zero in, on determining
precisely, where it is that you are right now.</a>
00:01:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h01m38s">And people are often loathed to do that,
cause they actually don't wanna know.</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h01m41s">Cause they'd rather be spread out,
in a sort of half-blind manner, in the fog,</a>
00:01:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h01m49s">hoping, that the place that they're at, is better than it really is, and deluding themselves by remaining vague,</a>
00:01:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h01m55s">than to figure out: "I'm right here, right now, with these specific problems".</a>
00:01:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h01m59s">But it's actually better to do that!</a>
00:01:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h02m02s">Because if you have a set of specific problems,
and you've really narrowed them down,</a>
00:02:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h02m06s">and really specified them - then you can probably start fixing them.</a>
00:02:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h02m09s">And you can start fixing them in microwaves, bit by bit.</a>
00:02:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h02m14s">But, there's no way you can do that without
knowing where you are, it's impossible.</a>
00:02:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h02m18s">And you can kinda tell, if you don't know where you are.
It's quite straightforward:</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h02m22s">[inhale]</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h02m23s">If you are haunted by reveries of the past,</a>
00:02:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h02m27s">for events, that are older than approximately 18 months,</a>
00:02:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h02m31s">if they continue to come up in your mind, over and over,
in your dreams, over and over,</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h02m36s">you haven't extracted the world
out from your past experiences.</a>
00:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h02m41s">The potential is still trapped in the past.</a>
00:02:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h02m44s">And to confront the potential,
means to confront the Dragon of the Past,</a>
00:02:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h02m48s">and of course, that's terrifying.
And it can seriously be terrifying.</a>
00:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h02m51s">So for example, maybe you're vague,
and ill-informed, and ill-defined,</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h02m55s">because you were abused very badly, when you
were a child. 4 years old, something like that.</a>
00:02:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h02m59s">And maybe you were abused by a family member
 - cause that's generally who does the abusing!</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h03m03s">And so, that just makes it worse.</a>
00:03:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h03m05s">And then, what that means, is that...
[sniff] you've got a implicit...</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h03m09s">You've had an implicit encounter with malevolent evil,</a>
00:03:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h03m14s">that- No, you've had a direct encounter with malevolent evil,</a>
00:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h03m16s">but you have an implicit hypothesis of malevolent evil that's plaguing you.</a>
00:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h03m21s">It's still there - it's trapped in the memories, right?</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h03m24s">It's- it's trapped in the representational structure.</a>
00:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h03m26s">And as an adult, you're now faced with
the necessity of articulating that fully,</a>
00:03:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h03m31s">before you have any chance whatsoever of freeing yourself from it.</a>
00:03:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h03m33s">And so, that's no joke. Lots of times people have to
go into the past, that's what the psychoanalysts do.</a>
00:03:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h03m38s">And say "look, here, something came along,
just bloody well knocked me over,</a>
00:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h03m43s">and it isn't even that I repressed it".
Which- which I think, was...</a>
00:03:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h03m47s">Well, we won't talk about Freud's errors, because Freud
was a genius, so we'll just leave him alone. But...</a>
00:03:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h03m52s">But sometimes it's not repression. It's just, that terrible things happen to people at such a young age,</a>
00:03:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h03m57s">that there isn't a bloody chance in hell, that they can figure out why they happened, or what to do with them. Or what they mean.</a>
00:03:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h04m03s">And then you can carry that with you.
And you carry with you...</a>
00:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h04m06s">It's like, your, your...</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h04m09s">Your body encounters the world in stages,
and it happens very rapidly.</a>
00:04:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h04m13s">Well, it can extend over years, but
the initial stages happen very rapidly.</a>
00:04:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h04m16s">So for example,</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h04m17s">[inhale]</a>
00:04:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h04m18s">if you're walking down the road, and you hear
a large noise be- a loud noise behind you,</a>
00:04:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h04m21s">you'll go like this! That's a predator defence response,
by the way. You crouch down.</a>
00:04:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h04m26s">And that's to stop something from jumping on
your back, and getting at your neck too easily.</a>
00:04:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h04m30s">That's like, few me- few hundred miliseconds.
(snaps fingers) It's really fast, or even faster than that.</a>
00:04:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h04m35s">And it better be, because - something like a snake, let's say, can nail you just right now, so you better be fast.</a>
00:04:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h04m40s">But it's low resolution, it's like... danger snakes, something like that, or danger predatory cat, it's that fast.</a>
00:04:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h04m48s">And then, you can unravel that,
and categorize it, but that takes time.</a>
00:04:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h04m54s">You do that with emotion, and then you do it with cognition, and you can do that with long-term thinking, you know?</a>
00:04:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h04m59s">Because, maybe you've encountered someone
specifically malevolent and predatory at work.</a>
00:04:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h05m03s">It happens to people a lot, who's operating as a... as a destructive bully.</a>
00:05:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h05m07s">And who seems to have no positive function whatsoever,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h05m12s">and is only living that out. And then you,
you know, you don't know what to do about it.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h05m15s">So you- you're in prey mode, and I don't mean this
[pray] kind of mode, although that would help too,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h05m21s">But, I mean, you're acting like a prey animal.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h05m23s">And then you have this terribly complex thing to decompose, which is: "What the hell is up with this person?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h05m29s">Why are they making my life miserable?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h05m31s">What is it about me, that allows them to make my life miserable?"</a>
00:05:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h05m34s">That's a nasty little road to walk down.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h05m37s">And you're stuck with having to-
you're stuck with having to decompose it.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h05m40s">Maybe you can't!</a>

actually just happens to be beyond you!</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h05m52s">And that could easily be.
It's certainly the case for people who are young.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h05m55s">And it's the case for plenty of adults as well,
it's no simple thing to ma- to manage.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h05m59s">It's something too, that often soldiers, who have
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have do to,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h06m04s">because they've encountered terrible things.
They've either done them, or who ran into them.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h06m08s">And they need to update their moral model of the world,
or they end up in something, close enough...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h06m18s">Anyways, so you need to know where you are.</a>
00:06:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h06m21s">That's what this is: "Where are you?"</a>
00:06:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h06m23s">So you're navigating! You're a navigator,
you're a sailor on an ocean, man.</a>
00:06:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h06m27s">That's what- that's what you are! You are a mobile
creature, you go from point A to point B all the time.</a>
00:06:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h06m32s">You're not sitting there glued to a rock,
like some brainless, you know, sea creature.</a>
00:06:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h06m37s">There's a funny little creature called a 'hydra', very simple little creature.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h06m41s">In its juvenile stage it has a brain, cause it swims around,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h06m44s">but then, when it turns into an adult, it latches
itself to a rock, and promptly digests its brain.</a>
00:06:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h06m50s">Cause if you're just sitting on a rock, and you're not moving, you don't need a brain!</a>
00:06:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h06m53s">So... but that's not our issue, right?
We're- we're zipping around in the world.</a>
00:06:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h06m57s">And so, we're navigating agents, and so:
to navigate, there's two things you need to know.</a>
00:06:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h07m02s">The first is: where the hell are you - exactly, precisely. Right?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJ79r_54fc#t=00h07m06s">Razor-sharp.</a>
