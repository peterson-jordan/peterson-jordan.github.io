00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h00m06s">Of the effects of the future authoring program it has had a different</a>
00:00:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h00m09s">It's differential impact on men and it's had a particularly</a>
00:00:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h00m13s">differential impact on what I would call excluded men, and so that would be non-western ethnic minority men or</a>
00:00:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h00m21s">What?</a>
00:00:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h00m23s">Majority, man who are doing very well so for example at Mohawk College</a>
00:00:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h00m27s">The future authoring program had a particularly robust effect on</a>
00:00:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h00m31s">Mohawk College students who were men who hadn't done very well in high school</a>
00:00:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h00m34s">And who hadn't picked a major that had a destination a career destination at its end</a>
00:00:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h00m40s">so you can imagine those people are they have an ambiguous relationship with the idea of education and</a>
00:00:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h00m46s">They're not oriented specifically towards a goal. They're not very motivated</a>
00:00:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h00m51s">Now why did it have a differential effect on men?</a>
00:00:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h00m55s">That's a good question</a>
00:00:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h00m57s">Well first of all the women are doing better</a>
00:00:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h00m59s">so</a>
00:00:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h01m00s">It might just be a matter of the fact that it does better for people who aren't doing as well and at the moment most</a>
00:01:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h01m05s">Of them are men</a>
00:01:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h01m06s">I don't believe I think that might be part of it, but I don't believe that's all of it</a>
00:01:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h01m11s">I think that part of the reason that women are doing better is cuz they're agreeable and</a>
00:01:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h01m15s">So if a system sets out a structure and says here's a pathway to attainment</a>
00:01:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h01m20s">The women won't rebel against that they'll go along with it and that's working very well for them at the moment</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h01m24s">the men especially the men on the disagreeable end of the distribution</a>
00:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h01m27s">And there's way more men on the district disagreeable end of the distribution, then there are women right</a>
00:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h01m32s">That's what you get from if you look at overlapping normal distributions, so there's the male district female distribution for agreeableness</a>
00:01:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h01m40s">male distribution for agreeableness tremendous overlap</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h01m44s">Okay, women are higher all the really agreeable people are women all the really disagreeable people are men</a>
00:01:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h01m49s">And maybe the real differences occur at the extremes right so so and it's it's a very interesting side effect of overlapping</a>
00:01:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h01m57s">Distributions, so they people can be mostly the same</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h02m00s">But that can still produce</a>
00:02:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h02m02s">radical differences</a>
00:02:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h02m04s">Disagreeable men won't do anything they don't want to do</a>
00:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h02m07s">They just say up yours I'll go home and play video games</a>
00:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h02m11s">With you no. I'm not listening to your stupid and</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h02m14s">Why should I work for you? I'll just go have fun</a>
00:02:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h02m18s">I'll do my own thing</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h02m19s">I don't think they're motivated and so then if you take the men who are like that and you say, okay. What do you want?</a>
00:02:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h02m25s">You can have what you want</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h02m26s">But you have to figure out what it is</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h02m28s">So then they write down what they want they think oh hey well that might be worth having so maybe I'll put some effort into</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h02m33s">It that's what it looks like to me now</a>
00:02:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h02m35s">You know that's weak evidence, and this is a weak argument, but I'm trying to stretch out my understanding to account for this</a>
00:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h02m42s">But I'll tell you something else that's really weird. I don't understand this either, so</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h02m47s">More than 90% of the people who watch my videos on YouTube are men now</a>
00:02:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h02m51s">that's weird because not about 80% of psychology students are women so that is not what you would expect right you would expect that the</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h02m59s">Majority of them would be women and you might say well</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h03m01s">it's because of the political stance I've taken and I thought well that's possible so I went looked at the demographic data because I have</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h03m07s">That well before I did any of the political videos</a>
00:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h03m11s">85% of my viewers were men so it's actually increased a bit, it's increased by 6% and that's not trivial</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h03m17s">But it was still overwhelmingly men, so that was interesting. I thought what the hell</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h03m23s">why is that exactly and then now I've been watching crowds when I've been talking to them and</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h03m28s">The crowds that have come to see me in person this happened at the University of Toronto free speech debate</a>
00:03:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h03m33s">and I actually noticed it and</a>
00:03:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h03m35s">Commented on it before the debate took place because I was talking about intrinsic differences between men and women and I looked around the room</a>
00:03:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h03m41s">And I thought hmm hey 80% of the people in this room are men</a>
00:03:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h03m44s">So I had all the men's women and women stand up and then all the men stand up</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h03m48s">I said look like here's a natural experiment</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h03m51s">For some reason 80% of the people who showed up to this or men now everybody thought</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h03m55s">I was kind of cracked to to do that and it was a risk</a>
00:03:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h03m58s">You know what and all right, but I thought no weather something going on here</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h04m01s">And then what's interesting now is that every public appearance that I've made that's related to the sort of topics that we're discussing is</a>
00:04:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h04m09s">Overwhelmingly men it's like it's like</a>
00:04:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h04m11s">85 to 90%</a>
00:04:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h04m12s">And so I thought wow that's weird like what the hell's going on here exactly, and then the other thing. I've noticed is that?</a>
00:04:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h04m19s">I've been talking a lot to the crowds that I've been talking to not about rights</a>
00:04:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h04m23s">But about responsibility right because he can't have the bloody. What are you doing? You can't have the conversation about rights without the</a>
00:04:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h04m30s">conversation about responsibility because your rights are my</a>
00:04:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h04m34s">Responsibility that's what they are technically so you just can't have only half of that discussion</a>
00:04:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h04m40s">And we're only having half that discussion and the question is well</a>
00:04:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h04m43s">What the hell are you leaving out if you only have that half of the discussion and the answer is what you're leaving out</a>
00:04:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h04m50s">Responsibility and then the question is well</a>
00:04:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h04m52s">What are you leaving out if you're leaving out responsibility and the answer might be well, maybe you're leaving out the meaning of life</a>
00:04:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8#t=00h04m58s">That's what it looks like to me. It's like here you are</a>
