<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2cAmxV5OoY#t=00h02m15s">when the Guardian story came out I read it and the story purported to be about the threats that she had received</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2cAmxV5OoY#t=00h02m28s">you know, it was the same old thing:  Dr. Peterson, he's a provocateur. He has an army of trolls if anybody ever</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2cAmxV5OoY#t=00h02m44s">(that's the narrative now) the threat that threats were just the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2cAmxV5OoY#t=00h02m49s">prerequisite for the story, and then yeah like a dozen UK news</a>
00:02:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2cAmxV5OoY#t=00h02m55s">media sources that the newspapers in particular have picked us this up some</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2cAmxV5OoY#t=00h03m06s">but and see when the Guardian story broke I tweeted something</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2cAmxV5OoY#t=00h03m24s">we had an exchange of words, which is what we're supposed to do.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2cAmxV5OoY#t=00h03m32s">but here's the terrible thing about it.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2cAmxV5OoY#t=00h03m34s">You know, what happened was that the fact that I tweeted that was instantly used as</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2cAmxV5OoY#t=00h03m56s">There's no evidence that these threats are credible, and if you respond by</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2cAmxV5OoY#t=00h04m11s">I'm gonna do it anyways because</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2cAmxV5OoY#t=00h04m21s">And maybe that's enough and so you know it's okay to come out say that's enough</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2cAmxV5OoY#t=00h04m26s">But the thing it wasn't okay because as soon as I did it</a>
