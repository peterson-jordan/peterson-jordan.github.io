<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mjD3K96MVY#t=00h03m35s">the people who work hard are going to be pretty irritated on a fairly chronic basis with the people who are completely unproductive and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mjD3K96MVY#t=00h03m42s">My suspicions are that plenty of people who are completely unproductive in the history of the evolution of our species</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mjD3K96MVY#t=00h04m23s">Uptight then a conscientious person is probably not a very good choice.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mjD3K96MVY#t=00h04m27s">On the other hand if you're a conscientious person, and you're living with someone who's really unconscious</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mjD3K96MVY#t=00h04m32s">That's good because they might be able to help you relax</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mjD3K96MVY#t=00h04m35s">But you're not going to be happy with them because they don't work nearly as hard as you do</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mjD3K96MVY#t=00h04m38s">But even worse on the orderly dimension, you know some of you have had roommates, and maybe you're more orderly than your roommate</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mjD3K96MVY#t=00h04m45s">What does it mean?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mjD3K96MVY#t=00h04m58s">So actually one of the things that's emerged from the psychometric analysis</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mjD3K96MVY#t=00h05m02s">Is that women are slightly more orderly than men and I suspect that has something to do with the,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mjD3K96MVY#t=00h05m13s">Your proclivity is to be triggered by disorder twenty five seconds before your partner's.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mjD3K96MVY#t=00h05m21s">It doesn't take much difference for you to be the one that's always concerned about the mess first, so anyways</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mjD3K96MVY#t=00h05m26s">And so if you're a really orderly person, and you live with a disorderly person well good luck getting along with them</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mjD3K96MVY#t=00h05m32s">they're going to regard you [as] like uptight and and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mjD3K96MVY#t=00h05m45s">Just a bloody mess, and how can anyone possibly live with someone like you and so</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mjD3K96MVY#t=00h05m51s">So another reason why it's useful to understand your personality is because I think it gives you a better</a>
