much confused by in the modern world is what</a>
00:00:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h00m54s">archaic people meant by gods, and that’s
because whatever the deities were that had</a>
00:00:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h01m00s">the motive force that archaic people attributed
to the gods seemed to have disappeared in</a>
00:01:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h01m04s">modern culture. Now the Jungian in hypothesis
is that’s because they turned into psychological</a>
00:01:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h01m10s">traits, fundamentally, or motivational forces,
so what the, what archaic societies would</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h01m16s">describe as gods, we would describe as motivational
forces,</a>
00:01:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h01m19s">so, for example, Venus is a goddess, the goddess
of love, and we would associate her power</a>
00:01:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h01m24s">with love and sex fundamentally, and the reason
that that’s a reasonable association from</a>
00:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h01m32s">the archaic standpoint is because the motive
quality that makes up what Venus represents</a>
00:01:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h01m39s">is transpersonal, which means it’s not limited
to one person and it’s immortal in that</a>
00:01:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h01m46s">the motive force that characterizes sexual
affiliation exists whether or not a single</a>
00:01:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h01m50s">individual exists.
so it’s transpersonal, has the force of</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h01m54s">a personality , because, if you fall in love,
you’re motivated by a certain set of standards</a>
00:01:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h02m00s">and perspectives, right, if you’re gripped
by beauty, say, or if you’re gripped by</a>
00:02:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h02m04s">lust, that imposes a particular view of the
world on you and impels your actions, sometimes</a>
00:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h02m11s">despite your will, and so that would be equivalent,
from the archaic perspective, to possession.</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h02m17s">And it’s clearly the case that archaic societies
who are engaged in warfare, for example, would</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h02m22s">conduct rituals to ensure that the warriors
that made up their societies were, in fact,</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h02m27s">possessed by the correct god, so it might
be Mars, for example, the Roman God of War,</a>
00:02:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h02m31s">so that on the battlefield they exhibited
the proper characteristics of somebody who</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h02m35s">was in a battle, right, rage you can think,
rage, so possession by the God of War would</a>
00:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h02m41s">be equivalent to this possession by a state
of rage</a>
00:02:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h02m43s">Now, it’s not quite that simple, it isn’t
only that archaic people externalized motive</a>
00:02:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h02m49s">forces and gave them the status of deities,
what they did was more complex than that,</a>
00:02:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h02m53s">and I think you can understand that a little
bit better if you start to, if you start to</a>
00:02:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h02m57s">give some, uh, thought to the modern behavioral
notion of the stimulus.</a>
00:02:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h03m02s">Now the stimulus is a very, very weird concept,
because the behaviourists who were interested</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h03m07s">in taking apart what was inside the brain
would attribute motive force to the stimulus,</a>
00:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h03m12s">right, they’d say, if you present an animal
with a stimulus, he will therefor act, and</a>
00:03:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h03m17s">that meant that the behaviours were making
the presupposition that the motive power resided</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h03m22s">in some manner in the stimulus. Well and why,
why would they think like that?</a>
00:03:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h03m26s">Well, it’s an archaic mode of thought in
a sense. You can imagine a child saying, um,</a>
00:03:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h03m31s">one of my friends today made me really angry,
right, which means that the child is essentially</a>
00:03:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h03m36s">conflating his or her own internal emotional
state with the proximal stimulus that gave</a>
00:03:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h03m42s">rise to that state, and you see complex associations
like that taking place with regards to the</a>
00:03:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h03m47s">apprehension of beauty, say, because beauty
is a very, very complex and difficult to localize</a>
00:03:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h03m51s">phenomena; if you’re very attracted to someone,
are you attracted by them? Well in a sense,</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h03m58s">of course, you are, because there they are,
but in another sense you’re not at all because</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h04m01s">what’s happening is that you’re engaged
as much in the in attraction as anything that’s</a>
00:04:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h04m08s">motivating you from the outside world, and
I think that partly accounts for your sense</a>
00:04:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h04m11s">of foolishness, especially if the person that
you’re attracted to doesn’t return your</a>
00:04:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h04m16s">attraction,</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h04m16s">I mean, you, you know that from your perceptual
perspective you’re attracted and dominated</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h04m23s">by the object, but, uh, by the same token,
you know entirely that, easy as it is to presume</a>
00:04:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h04m29s">it’s them and their fault, say, pretty much
it all has to do with you, so in the modern</a>
00:04:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h04m34s">world where we’ve been able to separate
out the object and the motive force of the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h04m39s">object, the deities have sort of moved inside
of us and become psychological forces, but</a>
00:04:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h04m44s">you can understand if you think about it in
this manner that things weren’t so clear</a>
00:04:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h04m47s">prior to the dawn of the empirical age,</a>
00:04:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h04m52s">that gives you a little bit of background
with regards to what the notion of deity meant</a>
00:04:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h05m00s">to archaic societies who still utilize those
notions as explanatory terms. Okay, so we</a>
00:05:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h05m08s">know that if you’re caught up in one of
these little, uh, world games, that you may</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h05m35s">those two forces over great periods of time

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h06m15s">beyond your comprehension by the way, so I
just found out this week, uh, and this is</a>
00:06:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h06m19s">absolutely staggering, I think, that if you,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h06m24s">women and you track their menstrual cycle,
and then you give them t-shirts that men have</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h06m29s">worn to smell, that women who are ovulating
like the smell of symmetrical men better than</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h06m35s">A-symmetrical men, so and that’s partly
because symmetrical men are probably more</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h06m39s">healthy, but this is a good example of how
the motive forces that configure your world</a>

that I came across recently, it turns out</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h08m04s">to control your behaviour completely and voluntarily,
so, for example, if you’re gripped by fear,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h08m10s">if you’re gripped by fear, it’s very,
very difficult to overcome that voluntarily,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h08m17s">down, the underlying motivational and emotional
systems have control. Okay. So then what happens</a>
00:08:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h08m24s">from that perspective, then what happens when
you encounter something you don’t understand,</a>
00:08:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h08m28s">and I think the best way to explain it is
something like generalize disinhibition, which</a>
00:08:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h08m32s">is that all your underlying motivational and
emotional systems are more or less disinhibited</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h08m38s">simultaneously, and the reason for that is
because you want to be maximally prepared</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h08m42s">to do whatever the hell is necessary to do

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h08m46s">and because you don’t know what that thing
is going to be, all your systems go on, and</a>
00:08:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h08m51s">when psychologists talk about stress, which

00:09:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h09m02s">so then you come to the case of ancient Egypt
And one of the things Eliade points out, which</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h09m11s">I think is really interesting, I mean really

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h09m15s">you right now was essentially revealed in
Egyptian culture at the dawn of the culture</a>
00:09:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h09m21s">rather than developing over the course of
the culture. So the Egyptians had a revelation,</a>
00:09:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h09m26s">right, immediately that the most fundamental
of gods was the one who created as a consequence</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h09m32s">of his tongue and his speech, very much akin
to the Sumerian idea with regards to Marduk</a>
00:09:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h09m41s">and also to later Judao-Christian ideas.</a>
00:09:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h09m43s">so here’s the story. There’s four players
in this drama, OK? There’s Osiris, his wife</a>
00:09:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h09m49s">Isis, Horace their son, and Seth. And Seth
is Osiris’ evil brother, OK? Now Osiris</a>
00:09:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h09m59s">was a remarkable guy. He was the founder of
the Egyptian state from the mythological perspective,</a>
00:09:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h10m05s">so kind of like Romulus and Remus for Rome,
a myth or like George Washington for the U.S.,</a>
00:10:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h10m10s">right? A mythologized figure who represented
all of the Pharaohs and people for that matter</a>
00:10:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h10m16s">who’d actually constructed the Egyptian
state.</a>
00:10:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h10m18s">Osiris, father of Egypt, so to speak, but
Osiris is kind of old and a little archaic</a>
00:10:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h10m23s">and maybe a little bit senile and even possibly
a little bit naïve in that you know even</a>
00:10:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h10m28s">no matter how great you were in your youth,
as time goes on you lose contact with environmental</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h10m33s">transformations and the old rules that you
lived by are not necessarily applicable to</a>
00:10:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h10m38s">the present and some of those things that
you ignore become paramount in importance.</a>
00:10:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h10m43s">And it turns out that Osiris has an evil brother,
Seth, and Seth eventually turns into Satan</a>
00:10:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h10m48s">as mythology develops through the centuries.
And Seth is a nasty guy, right, I mean what</a>
00:10:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h10m55s">he wants more than anything is undeserved
dominion over the Egyptian state. Now Osiris,</a>
00:10:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h11m02s">because he’s not paying attention and because
he isn’t sufficiently cognizant anymore</a>
00:11:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h11m06s">of the power of evil, more or less ignores
his evil brother, who in turn chops him into</a>
00:11:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h11m15s">pieces and then distributes his pieces all
over the Egyptian state. Now you might say:</a>
00:11:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h11m22s">why didn’t he just kill him, right? I mean
you’d think chopping him up would kill him</a>
00:11:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h11m26s">but he’s a god, you can’t just kill them.
The reason in mythology, and you see this</a>
00:11:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h11m31s">in movies as well, where the villain never
quite dies or the hero never quite dies, is</a>
00:11:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h11m35s">because even if you eliminate individual embodiments
of what those figures represent, new embodiments</a>
00:11:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h11m41s">manifest themselves virtually immediately.
So one of the things mythology is quite clear</a>
00:11:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h11m45s">about is that you never win a final battle
with evil. It’s a permanent property of</a>
00:11:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h11m50s">the world.</a>
00:11:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h11m56s">So anyways, Seth hacks up Osiris, spreads
him all over the land. Osiris ends up living</a>
00:11:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h12m02s">a kind of shadowy and nebulous ghost-like
existence down in the underworld and Seth</a>
00:12:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h12m07s">becomes the ruler of the state. A nasty story.
Alright, but Osiris has Isis as a wife. Now</a>
00:12:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h12m15s">Isis had a huge cult. She was a powerful goddess,
goddess of the under world, a kind of combination</a>
00:12:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h12m23s">of Kali and Diana, so to speak, capable of
tremendous destructive power but also the</a>
00:12:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h12m28s">source of all good things – something very
much like Tiamat. Now Isis got wind of her</a>
00:12:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h12m35s">husband’s disintegration, so to speak, and
she went searching around Egypt till she found</a>
00:12:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h12m42s">his phallus and with it she makes herself
pregnant.</a>
00:12:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h12m45s">OK, so what does that mean exactly? It means
something like this. The collapse of any great</a>
00:12:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h12m52s">order brings with it new potential and I think
this is something that capitalism has way</a>
00:12:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h13m00s">over forms of government like communism. Capitalism
has mechanisms in place to allow large structures</a>
00:13:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h13m09s">that are no longer meeting their function
to collapse. But frequently when they collapse,</a>
00:13:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h13m14s">it’s not like they disintegrate into dust,
right, they disintegrate into sub-components,</a>
00:13:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h13m19s">so to speak, many of which then come to terms
with the fact that the order has collapsed</a>
00:13:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h13m25s">and build something new. So you can’t get
rid of culture so easily. You can hack it</a>
00:13:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h13m29s">up into bits, you can disembody it, so to
speak, you can spread it all over the state,</a>
00:13:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h13m33s">you can introduce chaos into it. But that’s
something that has the potential of new birth</a>
00:13:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h13m40s">like the phoenix rising from the ashes.
So anyways, Isis, who’s the matrix, who’s</a>
00:13:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h13m45s">Tiamat, gets Osiris’ phallus, which is the
container of the germ of culture, right, the</a>
00:13:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h13m53s">phenomenon that’s capable of the seminal
idea, and she makes herself pregnant and she</a>
00:13:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h13m59s">gives birth to Horace, who’s the long-lost
son of the rightful king, right, a very typical</a>
00:13:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h14m04s">mythological motif. OK, so Horace is alienated
from the kingdom, which is another very common</a>
00:14:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h14m11s">mythological motif, you know like how King
Arthur, for example, is raised by commoners?</a>
00:14:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h14m16s">The same story pops up in the story for Christ,
for example, because Christ has heavenly parents</a>
00:14:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h14m22s">but then he also has kind of ordinary parents
and it’s a very common motif. Anyways, so</a>
00:14:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h14m27s">Horace grows up outside of the classical structure
of the Egyptian state, which is tilted terribly</a>
00:14:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h14m36s">towards evil because Seth has dominated, because
Osiris was too blind to his evil brother to</a>
00:14:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h14m41s">take appropriate defensive actions, and he
grows to maturity. And then he decides, like</a>
00:14:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h14m46s">all rightful sons of the long-lost king, to
reclaim his heritage. So he goes back to Egypt,</a>
00:14:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h14m52s">right, and he has this vicious battle with
Seth and in the process, Seth tears out one</a>
00:14:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h14m58s">of his eyes. Well, fine, and that’s an indication
of just exactly how devastating a battle with</a>
00:14:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h15m04s">the forces of evil, so to speak, precisely
are. They represent a critical threat to the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h15m09s">integrity of consciousness, right? That’s
why he loses an eye. Well, luckily enough,</a>
00:15:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h15m14s">Horace has got his act together and he does
defeat Seth and he banishes him and he gets</a>

pop the eye back in, become emperor, everything’s</a>

about this politically. Now the Egyptians</a>
00:15:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h15m30s">had this really weird idea. They had the idea
that the living pharaoh was the living pharaoh</a>
00:15:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h15m37s">and the dead pharaoh at the same time. makes
no sense rationally but it makes a lot of</a>
00:15:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h15m42s">sense from a narrative perspective because
what they were saying is something like this:</a>
00:15:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h15m45s">look, you got to think that when you become
king, or when you become president, or when</a>
00:15:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h15m50s">you take on a role of that absolute magnitude,
that then you’re partly you but you’re</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h15m55s">also partly this role and there’s really
no way out of that, right? And the role is</a>
00:15:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h15m59s">composed of the unbelievable weight of the

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h16m04s">And you can say: well, that’s true for being

but it’s partly the role too. So the pharaoh</a>
00:16:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h16m17s">is the live pharaoh and the dead pharaoh because
the dead pharaoh represents culture, right?</a>
00:16:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h16m22s">The king is dead, long live the king.</a>
00:16:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h16m25s">OK, but paralleling that idea was the idea
that the pharaoh was not only the dead pharaoh</a>
00:16:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h16m31s">and the live pharaoh at the same time but
that he was Osiris and Horace at the same</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h16m34s">time. But then you think in the story, Horace
has taken over Seth, he’s got his eye back,</a>
00:16:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h16m40s">he can be king. But he isn’t king yet and
this is where the Egyptians really get their</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h16m45s">act together and I think, of the two stories
that I’m telling you, this is the one that</a>
00:16:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h16m50s">has the most significance, I think, for modern
people because we’re so likely to sidestep</a>
00:16:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h16m54s">our obligation to our culture, whatever that
happens to be. So instead of popping this</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h17m00s">eye back in his head, which is the first thing
you’d think he does, he decides he’s going</a>
00:17:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h17m04s">to go back to the underworld, where Osiris
is living in this ghostlike and dead manner,</a>
00:17:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h17m09s">since he’s been chopped up by Seth. So he
goes down into the underworld, which is no</a>
00:17:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h17m13s">piece of cake, and he finds Osiris there in
this kind of half-dead state and he gives</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h17m17s">him his eye. And that enlightens Osiris, right,
it gives him vision and so then he takes Osiris</a>
00:17:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h17m27s">back to Egypt arm in arm, so to speak. And
it’s the conjunction of Osiris and Horace</a>
00:17:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h17m33s">that constitutes the basis for Egyptian sovereignty
and that is bloody brilliant, right, because</a>
00:17:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h17m38s">the Egyptians figured out that so Horace is
Marduk, for all intents and purposes, right?</a>
00:17:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h17m44s">He’s this avenging hero. In the Egyptian
story, he fights political corruption rather</a>
00:17:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h17m50s">than chaos but you can understand that those
are two flipsides of the hero archetype, they</a>
00:17:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h17m55s">are.</a>
00:17:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h17m55s">The hero archetype has two basic elements.
One is the confrontation of the terrible aspect</a>
00:17:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h18m01s">of nature, chaos in its most brutal form,
and the other is the confrontation with the</a>
00:18:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h18m07s">archaic aspect of culture. And in some ways,
those aren’t distinguishable because if</a>
00:18:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h18m12s">culture isn’t archaic, chaos never makes
itself present. So which is to say you can’t</a>
00:18:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h18m18s">separate out political degradation from environmental
degradation, say, it’s the same idea.</a>
00:18:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h18m28s">So anyways, Horace has this great idea. He
needs his father, right, and I told you about</a>
00:18:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h18m33s">the same motif emerging in Pinocchio, we already
looked at that, right? Pinocchio doesn’t</a>
00:18:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h18m38s">become genuine until he risks his life saving
his father, alright, so the same thing is</a>
00:18:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h18m43s">happening in this particular situation. So
that’s pretty cool. So then you get the</a>
00:18:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h18m47s">situation where the Egyptians characterize
sovereignty as the capability to overcome</a>
00:18:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h18m53s">evil in the political domain, combined with
– and that’s a youthful capability, right</a>
00:18:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h18m58s">– combined with the wisdom of the past,
alright? Then you look at that from a political</a>
00:18:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h19m03s">perspective and you find out already that
the Egyptians viewed the pharaoh as the live</a>
00:19:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h19m08s">pharaoh and the dead pharaoh simultaneously.</a>
00:19:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h19m10s">But then you find out something else that’s
interesting and it gives you some real insight</a>
00:19:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h19m14s">into just exactly how bloody powerful these
ideas were. So you think: what did the Egyptians</a>
00:19:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h19m19s">do with their spare time? And then you think:
well, they built the pyramids, right, I mean</a>
00:19:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h19m24s">and that was no trivial undertaking. It was
sort of the 5000 B.C. equivalent of flying</a>
00:19:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h19m30s">to Mars. And I mean the pyramids are pretty
impressive now but they were a hell of a lot</a>
00:19:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h19m34s">more impressive in their original form because
they were in the middle of an immense complex.</a>
00:19:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h19m39s">And the pyramids were dedicated to the immortality
of the pharaoh and the pharaoh was possessed</a>
00:19:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h19m45s">by a spirit called Ka and Ka was his immortal
spirit and it was the union of Horace and</a>
00:19:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h19m51s">Osiris, OK?</a>
00:19:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h19m52s">So Egyptian society was dedicated to deifying
the immortal spirit of the pharaoh, the union</a>
00:19:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h20m01s">of Horace and Osiris. And it was the union
that gave the, it was this identification</a>
00:20:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h20m07s">with this union that gave the pharaoh a phenomenon
the Egyptians called Maat and Maat was like</a>
00:20:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h20m14s">truth or good order. And you could think about
it as conscience in a sense is if the pharaoh</a>
00:20:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h20m19s">was utilizing the union of Horace and Osiris,
then he would have an intuitive ability to</a>
00:20:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h20m26s">decide what the appropriate course of order
was. And so the Egyptians would say, for example,</a>
00:20:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h20m33s">when the pharaoh came into the court, they’d
say: the sun has risen by that they meant</a>
00:20:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h20m37s">the power that reigned over the dominion of
the night had arrived. They conceptualized</a>
00:20:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h20m42s">maat as the capacity to put order in the place
of chaos, essentially formally. So they assimilated</a>
00:20:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h20m49s">the union of Horace and Osiris with the capability
of putting order in the face of chaos. They</a>
00:20:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h20m54s">regarded that as immortal and they spent all
of the excess resources of their society glorifying</a>
00:20:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h21m00s">that idea. And you think: you don’t produce
something like the pyramids without really</a>
00:21:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h21m04s">being possessed by an idea, right? This is
no trivial undertaking, it’s going over</a>
00:21:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h21m10s">a period of several hundred, if not several
thousand, years. That takes an awful lot of</a>
00:21:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h21m14s">work. So this idea of the immortality of the
union of Horace and Osiris and its association</a>
00:21:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h21m19s">with sovereignty was an absolutely potent
idea for the Egyptians. It gave their whole</a>
00:21:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h21m23s">culture motive force.</a>
00:21:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h21m25s">OK, so the Egyptians thought: the pharaoh
is immortal and that’s the reason why and</a>
00:21:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h21m30s">we more or less partake in his immortality
by being his subjects. So that was a pretty</a>
00:21:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h21m34s">good deal. But then Eliade points out something
very interesting and this is called the democratization</a>
00:21:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h21m40s">of Osiris and what you found was that initially
there were certain symbolic presentations</a>
00:21:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h21m46s">representing the immortality of the pharaoh
that could only be used by the pharaoh. But</a>
00:21:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h21m50s">as Egyptian culture continued to develop,
then the symbolic representations of immortality</a>
00:21:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h21m56s">started to be adopted by the aristocracy.
Now what did that mean? It meant that this</a>
00:21:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h22m04s">process that the Egyptians had conceptualized
as integral to the order of the state was</a>
00:22:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h22m11s">no longer solely embodied in the hands of
the pharaoh, right? It had started to drift</a>
00:22:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h22m16s">down the power hierarchy into the aristocracy,
OK? Well then you think: what happens after</a>
00:22:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h22m22s">that? So by the end of Egyptian society, the
aristocrats were characterized by an identity</a>
00:22:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h22m28s">with the union of Horace and Osiris, right?
Sovereignty had started to spread itself out.</a>
00:22:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h22m33s">And you think: what starts to happen with
the Greeks, right? The Greeks attribute sovereignty</a>

no. But at least all males, right? You get</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h24m47s">the optimal combination of creativity and
traditionalism, say, if that’s the optimal</a>
00:24:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h24m52s">combination, and if we’re prepared to regard
that as optimal, if that’s a – if that’s</a>
00:24:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h24m59s">what you perceive when you perceive someone
that you respect and admire, then you could</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h25m04s">say that success in our social hierarchies
is predicated on the degree to which you actually</a>
00:25:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h25m10s">embody that combination. And then you see
an interaction between individual success</a>
00:25:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h25m17s">and the social construction that would be
an interaction that extends over centuries</a>
00:25:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h25m21s">or even thousands of centuries so that as
these ideas become more and more developed,</a>
00:25:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h25m27s">we become more and more adapted to embodying
them as a consequence of evolutionary pressure.</a>
00:25:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h25m33s">So it’s not just cultural, it’s also biological.</a>
00:25:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h25m36s">So our political presuppositions rest on a
cultural basis which is unbelievably archaic,</a>
00:25:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h25m43s">resting in turn on something even lower than
that. And I think examples of that are those</a>
00:25:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h25m48s">that I’ve provided you with already. We
know, for example, that chimps who have to</a>

especially the males, but they’re also very</a>
00:25:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h25m57s">cooperative. So the males who are aggressive
spend a substantial amount of time repairing</a>
00:25:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h26m02s">social boundaries in the aftermath of an aggressive
incident because they’re just as concerned</a>
00:26:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h26m07s">with keeping the bloody hierarchy intact as
they are in climbing it. They have to be.</a>
00:26:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h26m14s">And we know that even wolves won’t kill
a subordinate wolf once they’ve defeated</a>
00:26:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h26m18s">it. They allow the subordinate wolf to maintain
its own existence, right, they have this notion,</a>
00:26:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h26m23s">this procedural notion that – even those
entities that appear insignificant may, in</a>
00:26:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h26m30s">some manner that’s beyond speech, still
contribute to the integrity of the whole.</a>
00:26:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h26m35s">And that’s an idea that’s very much similar
to our notion that sovereignty inheres in</a>
00:26:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h26m39s">the individual, right? We’ve taken it further.
No matter what you do, even if you’re in</a>
00:26:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h26m43s">clear violation of the law, your rights remain
intact because no matter how outcast you are</a>
00:26:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h26m48s">and how apparently beyond redemption, your
existence may still contribute something to</a>
00:26:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h26m52s">the integrity of the whole. And as far as
I’m concerned, that doesn’t appear to</a>
00:26:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h26m56s">be a metaphorical idea. If you dismiss it,
you cannot dismiss it without simultaneously</a>
00:26:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h27m02s">dismissing the ground on which our states
rest. And so then you have to ask yourself:</a>
00:27:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h27m07s">are you willing to do that? And if the answer
is no, well then you have to start to question</a>
00:27:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h27m13s">what it is that you actually believe, because
if you buy the doctrine of natural rights,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h27m17s">which you do, you act it out, then all of
this follows in its wake, or it rests on sand.</a>
00:27:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbPaCIm4yw#t=00h27m24s">And it bloody well better not rest on sand.</a>
