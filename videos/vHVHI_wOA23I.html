					<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h00m00s">You're in a class, it's near the beginning of the semester.
You write an exam, or you hand in an essay.</a>
00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h00m05s">And you don't get the mark, that you desired.
Okay, so what are your options?</a>
00:00:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h00m09s">Well one option would be: so you hit an anomaly.
Things didn't happen, the way you wanted them to happen.</a>
00:00:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h00m14s">And so, maybe you say "Jeez!
That was a boring and stupid class anyways.</a>
00:00:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h00m18s">This gives me an excuse to get out,
and so, that's not such a negative thing."</a>
00:00:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h00m21s">Or you think: "Oh well, I really better buckle down
and study", and you decide to stay in the class.</a>
00:00:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h00m27s">So basically, what you've done, is maintained your framework - "I'm going to work through this class",</a>
00:00:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h00m32s">but you've decided to modify some of the subroutines, that make up that frame.</a>
00:00:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h00m38s">You say "well, I should study more next time" or "I have to prioritize this class, compared to other classes".</a>
00:00:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h00m42s">So it's a micro-alteration within the overarching framework.</a>
00:00:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h00m46s">But another thing you can do, is say...</a>
00:00:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h00m49s"><em>waves hand</em></a>
00:00:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h00m50s">"To hell with the class!
I just won't- I'll just drop it."</a>
00:00:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h00m54s">And so, the advantage to that is: problem gone.</a>
00:00:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h00m58s">The disadvantage is: well, now you have a different problem.</a>
00:00:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h01m00s">Which is - okay, fine, you drop the class.</a>
00:01:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h01m03s">1) Do you have another class,
that you can replace it with?</a>
00:01:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h01m06s">2) Is that a good way of dealing with a micro-failure?</a>
00:01:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h01m09s">You know, to move up a level of analysis,
and throw out the whole frame.</a>
00:01:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h01m13s">Because you could also say: "Well, maybe I should just drop out of university, and maybe I should go hang myself."</a>
00:01:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h01m18s">You know, that's- Well, it's the same line of logic,
it's just taken up to a higher degree of abstraction.</a>
00:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h01m23s">And so, generally speaking,
you don't wanna solve a problem,</a>
00:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h01m27s">by moving up a level, and wiping out the frame,
within which the problem was experienced!</a>
00:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h01m32s">You- you wanna do that carefully.</a>
00:01:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h01m34s">Because in principle, the frame that you were working within,</a>
00:01:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h01m37s">had already- you'd already assigned value to it,
and worked at it. You've already invested in it.</a>
00:01:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h01m42s">It's a big sacrifice to blow out the whole frame.
Now, sometimes you can do it.</a>
00:01:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h01m47s">So anyways, what happens is - well...</a>
00:01:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h01m50s">You get the bad grade, and you're upset about it.</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h01m53s">And so, you've been plunged from your happy,
satiated state, let's say - into a state of relative Chaos.</a>
00:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h02m00s">And the Chaos is: "Oh! I hit an obstacle,
I didn't expect it, and now I don't know what to do".</a>
00:02:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h02m07s">And so, what does it mean,
"to not know what to do"? Well...</a>
00:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h02m11s">It can mean "I need to study harder".</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h02m15s">It can mean "I should drop this course".</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h02m17s">It can mean "I should major in a different subject".</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h02m20s">It can mean "maybe I shouldn't be in university".</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h02m22s">It could mean "maybe my future plans
have been formulated badly".</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h02m25s">It could mean "my future plans have been formulated badly, because I don't understand myself very well,</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h02m30s">and I've been telling lies about my past", right?</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h02m33s">The thing can really expand on you.</a>
00:02:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h02m36s">And that's what the chaotic domain is.</a>
00:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h02m38s">That's the re-manifestation of those things,
that you had considered irrelevant.</a>
00:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h02m43s">Right? Because when you go to pick up the exam,</a>
00:02:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h02m46s">you've got your identity, as a competent student, intact.</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h02m49s">You're not questioning, whether you should be in the course, or whether you should be in that major,</a>
00:02:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h02m53s">or whether you should be in university. None of that!</a>
00:02:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h02m55s">That's all in the implicitly accepted category.</a>
00:02:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h02m59s">And as soon, as the anomalous event emerges... <em>pop</em></a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h03m02s">all of those things, that you had rendered axiomatic,
start to become questionable.</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h03m08s">And that's like the shark, [stutter]
coming up from the depths, to pull you down.</a>
00:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h03m13s">And that's the classic way of representing that, and of symbolizing it.</a>
00:03:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h03m16s">That's "Jonah and the Whale", for example.</a>
00:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h03m19s">So, if something is- manifests itself from the deep Unknown,</a>
00:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h03m22s">and pulls you under, like an alligator at a waterhole.</a>
00:03:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h03m26s">Which is I'm sure, one of the sources, from which we derived that particular kind of mythological representation.</a>
00:03:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h03m32s">Because you could imagine, that when
we were on the veldt, after living on trees;</a>
00:03:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h03m36s">we had to go down to the damn waterholes.</a>
00:03:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h03m39s">And you've- you've watched enough nature programs,
to know, what a Nile crocodile can do to a water buffalo.</a>
00:03:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h03m44s">It's not pretty.</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h03m45s">And so, to "go down to the water" the chaotic
water - and the source of all life as well, right?</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h03m51s">Is to risk and encounter with the terrible thing, that lurks in the depths.</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h03m54s">And so, we use that as a central metaphor, for mapping</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h03m59s">the sorts of things, that happened to us in a much more abstract space.</a>
00:03:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h04m03s">And you know that!
Because one of the things you're going to do...</a>
00:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h04m06s">Let's say, that the- the professor...</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h04m11s">There's a professor, obviously,
who gave you the bad grade.</a>
00:04:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h04m15s">Okay, so one logical presupposition is, that you're in some sense insufficient, in relationship to the course.</a>
00:04:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h04m22s">But another logical and instantaneous categorization, is to throw that person into the category of 'malevolent predator'.</a>
00:04:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHI_wOA23I#t=00h04m30s">And you'll do that, by becoming upset
and cursing the person in your imagination... heh.</a>
