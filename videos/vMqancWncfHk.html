00:00:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h00m08s">Well this picture this is a picture of Venus the goddess of love</a>
00:00:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h00m12s">Right, and so I cut this picture out of a larger picture and it's Venus</a>
00:00:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h00m16s">Manifesting yourself in a transcendent space in the sky in the same way that Christ did in the previous</a>
00:00:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h00m22s">Representation and she has raised coming off her and there's all these men who are Knights</a>
00:00:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h00m28s">Kneeling in front of the image. Well, what does that mean?</a>
00:00:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h00m32s">Well, it means that men used the image of female perfection to motivate themselves</a>
00:00:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h00m37s">And that's exactly right. That's precisely what they do. You see that in the Tom Sawyer's story</a>
00:00:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h00m41s">so Tom Sawyer is about twelve years old and he's still</a>
00:00:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h00m44s">hanging around with his friends like Huck Finn and this wood girl moves across the street Becky and she comes out and he's struck by</a>
00:00:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h00m50s">Her for the first time in his life something's changed</a>
00:00:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h00m53s">and the first thing he does is hop up on a picket fence and</a>
00:00:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h00m56s">Show off and balance in front of her and he's saying well look at me look at me</a>
00:00:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h01m00s">I'm he's like the male bowerbird building something beautiful. So the female will approve of it and it's it's motivation</a>
00:01:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h01m07s">You know and that's something that I think modern women don't really understand about men. They don't understand that</a>
00:01:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h01m14s">At least to the degree that males are uncorrupted and not bitter because of being rejected</a>
00:01:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h01m19s">They're doing everything they can to kneel before the eternal image of the feminine</a>
00:01:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h01m25s">And try to make themselves worthy that's the chivalry story right that's what you should encourage in your partner</a>
00:01:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h01m32s">So and so out of chaos emerges this first form. It's the feminine form</a>
00:01:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h01m38s">It's partly the form that represents novelty as such</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h01m42s">so and</a>
00:01:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h01m43s">and on one hand its promise and the other hand its threat that you wouldn't believe and I don't know because I don't know</a>
00:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h01m49s">I Don't understand the situation with women as well as I understand the situation with men obviously being a man</a>
00:01:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h01m55s">but I don't know if women have any idea how paralyzing they are to especially young men</a>
00:01:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h02m05s">A very large number of my clinical clients, but also young men I've talked to in general are absolutely</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h02m11s">Terrified of women because they're terrified to be rejected and the terror exists in precise proportion to their attraction to the woman</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h02m19s">Which is a horrible paradoxical situation to be in. It's often why</a>
00:02:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h02m23s">Men make such fools of themselves</a>
00:02:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h02m25s">in front of women that they're attracted to it's because first of all</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h02m28s">They don't see the woman that they're attracted to because what the hell do they know about her?</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h02m32s">They don't see her as an individual</a>
00:02:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h02m34s">they see her as the manifestation of a judgmental ideal</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h02m38s">And then it's only in establishing the relationship with the actual woman that they could start differentiating</a>
00:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h02m43s">between the judgmental ideal and the actual individual woman and that also requires a sacrifice and the sacrifice is</a>
00:02:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h02m52s">You never can have an ideal woman</a>
00:02:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h02m56s">So to have relationship with any woman</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h02m58s">you have to sacrifice the relationship with the ideal woman and you have to see the individual woman</a>
00:02:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h03m05s">And separate her from the ideal and that's the same thing that happens to the hero in Sleeping Beauty, right?</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h03m11s">He sees the Evil Queen who actually turns into the Dragon of Chaos</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h03m14s">and it's not until he can defeat her that he</a>
00:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h03m19s">Can establish a relationship with the actual princess and that's exactly the case</a>
00:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h03m23s">I had a one of my clients who ran this men's group which was quite interesting one of the things they had the initiates</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h03m33s">Do which was very intelligent was to go out and ask 50 women in one day for their phone numbers</a>
00:03:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h03m39s">Why?</a>
00:03:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h03m40s">politely properly</a>
00:03:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqancWncfHk#t=00h03m41s">you know it wasn't it wasn't it was a game, but it wasn't a stupid game and</a>
