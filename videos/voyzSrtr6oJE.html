Hicks, who is a professor of philosophy in</a>
00:00:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h00m27s">the Department of Philosophy at Rockford University
in Illinois. Professor Hicks has written a</a>
00:00:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h00m34s">book—he’s written several books—but
he’s written one in particular that I wanted</a>
00:00:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h00m40s">to talk to him about today called Explaining
Postmodernism: Skepticism and Socialism from</a>
00:00:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h00m45s">Rousseau to Foucault, which was published
a fair while ago now, in 2004, but I think</a>
00:00:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h00m52s">has become even more pertinent and relevant
today.</a>
00:00:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h00m56s">I have talked a lot to my viewers about your
book, and so let’s talk about Postmodernism</a>
00:00:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h01m02s">and its relationship with Neo-Marxism. So
maybe you could tell the viewers here a little</a>
00:01:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h01m10s">more about yourself and how you got interested
in this.</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h01m13s">Well, I finished graduate school in philosophy
in the early 90s, originally from Canada,</a>
00:01:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h01m21s">born in Toronto. At that point Pittsburgh
and Indiana had the two strongest philosophy</a>
00:01:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h01m27s">of science and logic programs, and that’s
what I was interested in at the time. And</a>
00:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h01m30s">so upon a professor’s recommendation, I
ended up at Indiana, and it worked out very</a>
00:01:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h01m35s">nicely for me.</a>
00:01:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h01m37s">So most of my graduate work was actually in
epistemology, philosophy of science, logic,</a>
00:01:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h01m43s">some cognitive science issues as well. So
a lot of the epistemological and philosophical/linguistic</a>
00:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h01m49s">issues that come up in Postmodernism—the
groundwork so to speak was laid for that.</a>
00:01:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h01m56s">When I finished grad school and started teaching
full-time, came to Rockford University. I</a>
00:01:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h02m02s">was teaching in an honors program, and the
way that program worked was—it was essentially</a>
00:02:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h02m06s">a Great Books program—and so it was like
getting a second education, wonderfully. But</a>
00:02:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h02m11s">the way it was done was that each course was
taught by two professors to our honor students.</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h02m17s">So the professors would be from different
departments, so I was paired with literature</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h02m23s">professors, history professors, and so on.
And this was now the middle of the 90s.</a>
00:02:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h02m28s">I started to hear about thinkers I had not
read. I’d kind-of heard about them, but</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h02m33s">now I was reading them more closely and finding
that in history and literature and sociology</a>
00:02:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h02m39s">and anthropology, names like Derrida and Foucault
and the others, if not omnipresent, were huge</a>
00:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h02m47s">names. So I realized I had a gap in my education
to fill. So I started reading deeply in them.</a>
00:02:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h02m56s">My education in some ways was broad in the
history of philosophy but narrow at the graduate</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h03m02s">school level and I had focused mostly on Anglo-American
philosophy, so my understanding of the Continental</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h03m08s">traditions was quite limited. But by the time
I got to the end of the 90s, I realized there</a>
00:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h03m15s">was something significant going on coming
out of Continental philosophy. And that’s</a>
00:03:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h03m20s">where the book [published 2004] came out of.
When you say significant, what do you mean</a>
00:03:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h03m24s">by that? Do you mean intellectually? Do you
mean socially? Politically? There’s lots</a>
00:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h03m25s">of different variants of “significant.”When
you say significant, what do you mean by that?</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h03m26s">Do you mean intellectually? Do you mean socially?
Politically? There’s lots of different variants</a>
00:03:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h03m30s">of “significant.”
At that point, “intellectually.” This</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h03m33s">was still in the 1990s so postmodernism was
not yet (outside of, say, art) a cultural</a>
00:03:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h03m40s">force, but it was strongly an intellectual
force in that. At that point, young Ph.D.s</a>
00:03:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h03m47s">coming out of sociology, literary criticism,
some sub-disciplines in the law (if you’re</a>
00:03:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h03m54s">getting Ph.D. in the law), historiography
and so on, and certainly in departments in</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h04m03s">philosophy still dominated by Continental
traditional philosophy: almost all of them</a>
00:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h04m09s">are primarily being schooled in what we now
call postmodern thinkers, so the leading gurus</a>
00:04:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h04m17s">are people like Derrida, Lyotard, from whom
we get the label post-modern condition, Foucault</a>
00:04:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h04m25s">and the others.
So maybe you could walk us through what you</a>
00:04:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h04m30s">learned, because people are unfamiliar ... I
mean, you were advanced in your education,</a>
00:04:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h04m36s">including in philosophy, and still recognized
your ignorance, say, with regards to postmodern</a>
00:04:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h04m43s">thinking, so that’s obviously a condition
that is shared by a large number of people.</a>
00:04:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h04m48s">Postmodernism is one of those words like Existentialism
that covers an awful lot of territory, and</a>
00:04:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h04m52s">so maybe we could zero in on exactly what
that means, and who these thinkers were: Derrida,</a>
00:04:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h04m58s">Foucault, and Lyotard, and what you learned
about them.</a>
00:04:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h05m03s">Fair enough. Well, all of the thinkers you
just named—they think broadly, they think</a>
00:05:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h05m08s">strategically, and they do have a very strong
historical perspective on their disciplines,</a>
00:05:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h05m14s">and at the same time they are trying to assess
where they think we are culturally, politically,</a>
00:05:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h05m19s">socially—and all of them are making a very
dramatic claim: that to some extent or in</a>
00:05:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h05m26s">some way Modernism has either ended or it
has reached its nadir, or all of the … kind</a>
00:05:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h05m34s">of the pathologies and negative traits within
the modern world are reaching a culmination</a>
00:05:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h05m41s">in their generation, and so it’s time for
us to both recognize that Modernism has come</a>
00:05:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h05m47s">to an end, and that we need some sort of new
intellectual framework, a post-modern-like</a>
00:05:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h05m52s">framework.
And the Modernism that they’re criticizing,</a>
00:05:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h05m57s">how would you characterize that? That’s
Enlightenment values? Scientific rationalism?</a>
00:05:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h06m02s">How would you characterize it, exactly?
All of those would be elements of it. But</a>
00:06:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h06m06s">then of course there are some discipline-specific
differences: so literature people and philosophy</a>
00:06:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h06m12s">people and historians will use Modernism slightly
differently. But the idea at core is that</a>
00:06:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h06m19s">if you look at the pre-modern world—essentially
the world of the Middle Ages, say—that that</a>
00:06:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h06m27s">was itself broken up by a series of revolutions:
the Renaissance, Reformation, Counter Reformation,</a>
00:06:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h06m34s">early scientific revolutions—and all of
this is going on in historically short chunks</a>
00:06:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h06m40s">of time: 1500s and 1600s.</a>
00:06:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h06m44s">And so if you look at both the intellectual
world and the social world, comparing, say,</a>
00:06:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h06m50s">the 1400s with the 1700s, culturally and intellectually
you’re in a different universe at that point.</a>
00:06:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h06m58s">So the features then of the modern world—now
I’m going to use my philosophical labels</a>
00:06:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h07m04s">here—are that we are now naturalistic in
our thinking. We are no longer primarily supernaturalistic</a>
00:07:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h07m12s">in our thinking. So we might still be open
to the idea that there’s a God or some sort</a>
00:07:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h07m17s">of supernatural dimension, the way Deists
are, but first and foremost we’re taking</a>
00:07:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h07m22s">the natural world as a more or less self-contained,
self-governing world that operates according</a>
00:07:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h07m28s">to cause and effect, and we’re going to
study it in its terms.</a>
00:07:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h07m31s">We’re not seeing the natural world as derivative
of a “higher” world or that everything</a>
00:07:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h07m37s">that happens in the natural world is part
of “God’s plan” where we read omens</a>
00:07:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h07m43s">and so forth into everything.</a>
00:07:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h07m45s">So metaphysically then there’s been a revolution:

not necessarily a skepticism about shared</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h10m56s">of the 20th century comes along, there’s

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h11m24s">So what is it that the postmodernists are

00:11:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h11m27s">Just on those two issues: (1) the metaphysical

that we can, through science—even not necessarily</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h11m58s">And again, what happens in this case is there
is a revolution. Probably by the time we get</a>

are starting to say things like: Well, if</a>

so on—so we start to critically examine</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h12m58s">So if, for example, you take perception as

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h14m42s">Right. Well, the postmodernists will use both

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h17m30s">So Kant is, in effect, standing at the end
of these two traditions and saying, “You</a>

we should go ahead and continue our discussion</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h18m02s">Absolutely, and some of the postmodernists
do describe themselves as Neo-Pragmatists,</a>
00:18:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h18m07s">like Richard Rorty for example. So yes, that’s
exactly a direction that’s worth going.</a>
00:18:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h18m13s">Okay, okay. So my understanding of that, if
I was going to defend the Modernist tradition,</a>
00:18:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h18m19s">let’s say, I would say that we have instantiated
within us an a priori perceptual structure</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h18m25s">that’s a consequence of millions—billions
of years for that matter—of biological evolution,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h18m31s">and it has emerged in tandem with continual
correction of its presuppositions by the selection</a>
00:18:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h18m38s">process. But it’s still subject to error
because we have a very limited viewpoint as</a>
00:18:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h18m45s">specific individuals, and not only are we
limited, but we can also make, you might say,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h18m52s">moral errors, and I’ll get back to that,
that cloud our judgment.</a>
00:18:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h18m57s">And so, in an attempt to “expand our purview”
and rectify those errors, we do two things:</a>
00:18:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h19m03s">(1) We test our hypothesis practically against
the world, which is to say, we say, “Here’s</a>
00:19:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h19m09s">a theory of reality.” We act it out. If
the theory of reality is sufficiently correct,</a>
00:19:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h19m13s">when we act it out, we get what we want, and
then that’s sufficient proof for the validity</a>
00:19:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h19m18s">of the theory. It’s not absolute proof,
but it’s sufficient proof. And then the</a>
00:19:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h19m22s">other thing we do (and I think this has been
paid attention to much less except by thinkers</a>
00:19:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h19m26s">such as Piaget) is that: (2) We further constrain
our presuppositions about reality with the</a>
00:19:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h19m33s">necessity of constructing theories that are
also acceptable to the people around us.</a>

currently existing social contract, and they</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h19m51s">And that’s a nice set of constraints, and
it seems to me that that, at least in some</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h19m54s">part, goes a long ways to answering the objections
to the limits of the scientific method that</a>
00:19:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h20m04s">have been discussed historically, and which
you just summarized.</a>
00:20:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h20m07s">All right, I’m sympathetic to much of what
you just went through. In fact a five-point</a>

been laid out, where you’re actually putting</a>

00:20:28</p>
<p>[So, if you take for example evolutionary epistemology

is, what I have to do is take for granted</a>
00:21:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h21m30s">basic assumptions, certain truths about the
world: that, for example, there is an external</a>

we have in-built structures; that those structures</a>

then as a consequence or as a conclusion,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h21m59s">you can infer that therefore the intellectual
products that come out of our cognitive processing</a>

to give to them.</a>
00:24:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h24m28s">Okay, so let me ask you a question about that.
This is a place where I got augured in very</a>
00:24:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h24m33s">badly with Sam Harris when we were discussing
metaphysical presumptions. So you know—and</a>
00:24:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h24m39s">I’m confused about this I would say to some
degree conceptually because I’m a scientist</a>
00:24:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h24m44s">and certainly operate most of the time under
the presupposition of an “independent objective</a>
00:24:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h24m49s">world”—but then I also have some difficulty
with the idea that it’s objective truth</a>
00:24:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h24m56s">within which all other truths are “nested.”
And that’s something that Sam and the people</a>
00:24:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h25m01s">that he represents in some sense are very
dead set on insisting.</a>
00:25:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h25m06s">Now it seems to me though that the crux of
the matter is something like “the method</a>
00:25:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h25m11s">of proof.” And this strikes me as very important
because, “My theory is correct enough if,</a>
00:25:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h25m18s">when I implement it, I get what I want”
is not the same as the claim “My theory</a>
00:25:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h25m24s">is true because it’s in accordance with
some independently existing objective world.”</a>
00:25:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h25m29s">I mean, both of those things could exist at
the same time, but I think the more appropriate</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h25m35s">claim to make with regards to human knowledge
is something like its “biological functionality,”</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h27m33s">knowledge is to guide action. And so they
will then hearken back to the earlier Baconian</a>

And I think this is relevant to Thomas Kuhn’s</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h32m51s">And then philosophically we say: Where do

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h33m17s">So there’s that whole tradition, and we
have to have a sophisticated theory about</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h33m22s">how all of that is going to work if we’re

a segue into the potential link between Neo-Marxism,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h34m08s">Because maybe you could say: Once you've opened

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h34m14s">the idea of “want” as a social construct,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h35m42s">Right.</a>
00:35:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h35m43s">So we might then say, No, it’s not so much
what you want as an individual, but rather</a>
00:35:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h35m46s">what we want, and we have to achieve some

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h35m50s">So that’s a slightly cartoon version, but
the difference between William James, who</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h35m59s">a bit more. So then we have a corrective on
all of the individual weirdos—who knows</a>

if we relativize it to the social group, when</a>
00:36:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=00h36m16s">we start looking at different social groups,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h01m00s">But to back up to our discussion about power—
It’s interesting that the way our discussion,</a>
01:01:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h01m07s">up to that point, then integrates three things:
(1) We started talking about truth, and then</a>
01:01:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h01m14s">(2) we started talking about goals and normative
ends and ideals, and then (3) we talk about</a>
01:01:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h01m22s">power.</a>
01:01:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h01m23s">So there we’ve got already the big three:
Truth, Ideals, and Power.</a>
01:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h01m29s">Our discussion about Truth took us into epistemological
issues in philosophy; our discussion about</a>
01:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h01m36s">Ideals takes us into ethics and meta-ethics
issues and also into philosophy; and our discussion</a>
01:01:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h01m42s">of Power takes us into issues about human
nature, all of which traditionally comprise</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h01m48s">a branch of philosophy and its sub-disciplines.</a>
01:01:48</p>
<p>[So we already have to have a theory of epistemology
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h01m51s">epistemology: the theory of knowledge, especially</a>
01:01:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h01m56s">with regard to its methods, validity and scope:
the investigation of what distinguishes justified</a>
01:01:56</p>
<p>[belief from opinion]; a theory of human nature;
a theory of ethics—and we can sometimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h01m57s)
01:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h02m00s">try to integrate those—and postmodernism
is going to be an integration of certain views</a>
01:02:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h02m06s">that develop in philosophical traditions in
all three of those areas.</a>
01:02:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h02m10s">So maybe one way to put it is this: If you
contrast it to kind of a—again, taking the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h02m19s">Enlightenment as our touchstone—I think
we’re both fans of the Enlightenment—we</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h02m25s">say: All right, we’re fine with power. Knowledge
is power, and we want to empower the individual.</a>
01:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h02m33s">We want to eliminate slavery and empower people.

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h02m39s">and empower women. So power is…</a>
01:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h02m43s">Yes, we actually want to remove arbitrary

01:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h02m49s">That’s right. So there are illegitimate
uses of power that are stopping and disempowering</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h02m56s">people. So it’s the double-edged sword.
And as long as power is properly directed</a>
01:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h03m02s">or properly located, then we are confident
that, by and large, people individually and</a>

01:03:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h03m16s">So it’s actually a very optimistic overall
assessment about power. But power is then</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h03m25s">structured as a means to an end: we want to

of us to allow our Marxist or our Nietzschean</a>

Absolutely right, and that’s why the Enlightenment</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h05m04s">articulation “Power is good if it’s in

we’re fine. And we’re optimistic enough</a>
01:05:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h05m15s">about human beings, cognitively and morally,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h05m25s">going to increase the net stock of justice.
So that entire “Enlightenment package”</a>
01:05:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h05m30s">is precisely what the Counter-Enlightenment
attacks. It attacked very fundamentally so</a>
01:05:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h05m36s">that by the time we get two to three generations
later— to the generations of Marx and Nietzsche—</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h05m42s">it has been hollowed out.
So on the epistemological side we don’t</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h05m47s">believe that there is such a thing as “truth”
anymore. So it’s not the case that “power”</a>
01:05:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h05m53s">is in the search of “truth,” because we
don’t believe that human beings are capable</a>
01:05:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h05m58s">of getting to any sort of objective truth

01:05:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h06m03s">And also on the normative side, we don’t

01:06:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h06m16s">And so then, once again, maybe we’re left
with subjective desires and so forth, but</a>
01:06:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h06m20s">we’re just left again with “power.”</a>
01:06:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h06m22s">So power in the service of Truth; power in
the service of Justice: that goes away. All</a>
01:06:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h06m27s">that we are left with is Power.</a>
01:06:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h06m28s">Okay, so then we could mount a psycho-analytic
critique of that set of objections. Because</a>
01:06:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h06m37s">I could say, Okay, here’s some reasons.
Let’s assume you’re doing something simple</a>
01:06:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h06m48s">and easy instead of complicated and difficult
with your objections. And so here’s the</a>
01:06:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h06m53s">simple and easy explanation:</a>
01:06:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h06m56s">You want to dispense with the idea of “justice”
and “truth” because that lightens your</a>
01:06:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h07m01s">existential load because now there’s nothing
difficult and noble that you have to strive</a>
01:07:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h07m05s">for, and you want to reduce everything to
“power” because that justifies your use</a>
01:07:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h07m09s">of power in your pursuit of those immediate
goals that you no longer even have to justify</a>
01:07:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h07m16s">because you don’t have to make reference
to any higher standards of, say, “justice”</a>
01:07:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h07m21s">or “truth.” And so I would say: That’s
a deep, impulsive and resentful nihilism that’s</a>
01:07:21</p>
<p>[manifesting itself as a glorious intellectual
critique. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h07m29s">Nihilism: a viewpoint that traditional</a>
01:07:29</p>
<p>[values and beliefs are unfounded and that
existence is senseless and useless.]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h07m32s)
01:07:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h07m33s">Now, I understand as well that there is the
history of genuine intellectual critique that</a>
01:07:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h07m39s">you’ve been laying out, which is not trivial—
but those things have to be differentiated,</a>
01:07:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h07m43s">you know. It’s certainly not reasonable
either for those who claim that “all there</a>
01:07:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h07m48s">is is power,” that they’re not themselves
motivated equally by that power.</a>
01:07:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h07m53s">Sure. So in one way, all right, what you can
always say, in effect, is that philosophy</a>
01:07:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h07m58s">is autobiographical. In many cases philosophers
will put their pronouncements in third-person</a>
01:07:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h08m04s">form, or in generalized form, but if you always
put it down to third-person formulations,</a>
01:08:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h08m09s">it can be profoundly self-revelatory.</a>
01:08:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h08m13s">So if you say, for example, “Human beings
are scum”—there you have some sort of</a>
01:08:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h08m18s">a pessimistic assessment of the human condition.
Well, built into that then is the idea that</a>
01:08:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h08m24s">I, if I “first-personalize it,” that “I
am scum.” What you’re really doing is</a>
01:08:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h08m28s">a first-person confession. And it’s always
then an illegitimate move to exempt yourself</a>
01:08:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h08m34s">from the general principle.</a>
01:08:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h08m37s">Right.</a>
01:08:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h08m38s">Or: “Everything just is “power relations”
and “people imposing their agendas on other</a>
01:08:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h08m47s">people.” Then what you’re saying is: “Well,
my fundamental commitment is power, and I</a>
01:08:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h08m52s">just want to impose my agenda on other people.”</a>
01:08:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h08m55s">So I do think you’re right— that it can
go both ways: It can of course be that you</a>
01:08:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h08m59s">have people who, for whatever reason, have
a predisposition to nihilistic, amoral power</a>
01:08:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h09m07s">seeking, and when they become adults and “intellectual,”
they latch onto theories that indulge them,</a>
01:09:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h09m16s">that enable them to rationalize their predispositions.</a>
01:09:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h09m19s">And so in many cases, yes, a lot of Postmodernism,
in some of its manifestations, is disingenuous</a>
01:09:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h09m26s">in that form. People don’t necessarily buy
into the postmodern philosophical framework,</a>
01:09:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h09m33s">but rather, in kind of pragmatic form, Postmodernism
as a set of “tools” is useful for them</a>
01:09:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h09m41s">to advance their own personal and social agendas,
whatever those happen to be.</a>
01:09:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h09m46s">Okay. So let’s switch a little bit. Let’s
switch over into that a little bit. I’ve</a>

philosophical end, but now I would like to</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h09m59s">make it a bit more personal, if you don’t

left politics more broadly, but certainly</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h13m50s">Right. Yes! So you have a huge then amount

So we can understand the temptation on the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h14m19s">part of a lot of people to find psychological

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h14m46s">Okay, that’s one strategy, and that’s
again one of the sub-strategies I think that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h15m07s">facts, and logic does not necessarily point

tempting for you to say, “Well, I can just</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h15m38s">And certainly some of the bad-faith postmodernists
do go down that road very much.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h15m43s">So in part that was my motivation for writing
the book.</a>
01:15:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h15m47s">And in part I did feel that I was in a good

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h16m01s">on the entire history of epistemology from
the modern world on through the way things</a>

was reading the same people that Rorty had.</a>
01:16:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h16m15s">I have to say I learned an enormous amount
from reading Richard Rorty. He’s first rate,</a>
01:16:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h16m21s">even though I end up disagreeing fundamentally
with him about everything … Foucault’s</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h16m27s">Ph.D. also was in philosophy; he also had
a Ph.D. in psychology. Derrida—another philosophy</a>
01:16:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h16m33s">Ph.D. Lyotard—another philosophy Ph.D. So,
not necessarily putting myself on the same</a>

to speak, are first-rate educated in epistemology.</a>
01:16:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h16m47s">So I know where they’re coming from and
where all of that is going.</a>
01:16:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h16m52s">At the same time, my undergraduate and master’s
degree at Guelph (just down the road from</a>

long-standing passion for how arguments and</a>
01:16:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h17m06s">movements develop over time, so I thought
I was in a good position to see how postmodernism</a>
01:17:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h17m14s">had evolved out of various other earlier movements
that had developed over time—and I am enough</a>
01:17:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h17m19s">of a political animal to be interested in
political philosophy. And I believe that abstract</a>
01:17:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h17m25s">philosophical theory, when it gets put into
practice, makes life-and-death practical differences</a>
01:17:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h17m30s">…</a>
01:17:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h17m31s">So the stakes are high. So I was motivated
then to put it all together: How does the</a>
01:17:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h17m37s">history and the philosophy and the politics
all come together in Postmodernism? So I wrote</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h17m44s">Now, yes. How it has affected me personally
in academic life. Well, let me see. In one</a>
01:17:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h17m52s">way I think I was fortunate that I had tenure
by the time the book was published, and my</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h17m58s">university is by and large a tolerant place.
We have some issues here, but by and large</a>
01:17:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h18m04s">my colleagues are reasonable, decent people,
and at least I was able to get tenure on the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h18m13s">strength of my teaching abilities and my publication.
And so it wasn’t that I was going to lose</a>
01:18:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h18m21s">my job over this.</a>
01:18:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h18m23s">But of course there is blowback. I did have
difficulty getting the book published in the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h18m29s">first place. Actually I finished writing the
book by the year 2000. I had taken a sabbatical</a>
01:18:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h18m35s">from 1999-2000 and wrote the book then, but
I was not able to get the book published until</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h18m40s">2004, and the reason for that was a number
of “desk rejections”—you know, the editor</a>
01:18:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h18m50s">just sends a form letter back. I got a few
of those. But, more seriously, what happened</a>
01:18:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h18m55s">three times, possibly four times, I don’t
remember exactly now, was it would get past</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h19m00s">the editor at the press, and then it would
be sent out to two or three reviewers—and</a>
01:19:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h19m06s">in each case what happened was I would get
split and polarized-split reviews. One would</a>
01:19:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h19m12s">come back and say, “This is a really good
book; he’s done his homework, it’s a good</a>

necessarily agree with all of it, but this</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h19m22s">really ought to be out there as a book”;
and then the other review on the other side</a>
01:19:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h19m28s">would be equally savaging: “This is a terrible
book; he doesn’t know his history of philosophy,</a>
01:19:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h19m33s">he’s butchered this that and the other thing,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h19m38s">publish this book.” And then almost always
in that situation, the editor just says, “No.”</a>
01:19:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h19m44s">So it wasn’t until late 2003, early 2004,
that Scholargy Publishing, which was then</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h19m53s">a small press working out of Arizona, took
the book on, and I’m happy to say that after</a>
01:19:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h19m59s">it was published, it’s been in print consistently

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h20m02s">Yes, that’s remarkable. That’s remarkable.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h20m04s">Yes, so I’m very happy about that …</a>
01:20:04</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h20m09s">Yes, and then multiple translations, and those
continue, so I’m happy about that.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h20m15s">Now I’d say the scholarly responses have
been from moderate liberals: so kind of traditional</a>

the reviews have all been strong, and strongly</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h21m35s">thing of reading it and giving my professional
opinion of it.</a>
01:21:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h21m40s">So I think they are aware of me, but there
hasn’t really been any direct intellectual</a>
01:21:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h21m44s">engagement, which is kind of sad.</a>
01:21:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h21m46s">Right. Yes. So now when you set yourself up
to write the book, were you thinking of writing</a>
01:21:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h21m53s">a critique of postmodernism, or were you thinking
of conducting an exploration of postmodernism?</a>
01:21:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h22m00s">Well, right now I’m working on the critique.
The first book ends—I don’t want to say</a>
01:22:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h22m06s">abruptly—but it does end with the door open
to saying: How then do we respond to this</a>
01:22:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h22m14s">dead end of Counter-Enlightenment thought
in postmodernism? So we’re at a point culturally</a>
01:22:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h22m20s">where the meaning of postmodernism has now
infected the academy and you see problems</a>
01:22:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h22m27s">there, but it’s also left the academy, and
so thoughtful people outside the academy are</a>
01:22:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h22m31s">seeing the results. And so the big question
is: What do we do next?</a>
01:22:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h22m35s">So I am actively working on the sequel to
Explaining Postmodernism now. And I did go</a>
01:22:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h22m41s">back and forth in the writing of it. My first
purpose was to write a straight diagnosis</a>
01:22:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h22m47s">and intellectual history of postmodernism,
and that’s where I ended up leaving it,</a>
01:22:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h22m54s">because in one sense this was a bit artificial,
but I really like 200-page books. It’s long</a>
01:22:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h23m01s">enough for you to get into a subject deeply
enough and to make a good, pointed, integrated</a>
01:23:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h23m07s">argument and then stop.</a>
01:23:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h23m09s">And so I realized if I wrote the sequel then,
it would be a 400-page book, and I thought</a>
01:23:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h23m16s">it was more important to get this self-contained
intellectual history of postmodernism out</a>
01:23:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h23m20s">there. So I brought things to I think a logical
conclusion where I ended the book, and now</a>
01:23:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h23m34s">I’m working on the next.</a>
01:23:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h23m36s">What’s the next one called?</a>
01:23:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h23m37s">The working title … it changes every few
months or so—sometimes I think about, The</a>
01:23:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h23m41s">Fate of the Enlightenment or something to
do with Neo-Enlightenment or—it won’t</a>
01:23:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h23m47s">be this—but Post-Postmodernism or After
Postmodernism—something like that.</a>
01:23:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h23m55s">Okay. We’ve been struggling with terminology
as well with the people I’m been talking</a>
01:23:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h23m59s">with about such things.</a>
01:23:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h24m00s">It’s a very hard thing to do, because as
we’ve seen philosophically, Postmodernism</a>
01:24:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h24m07s">is multi-dimensional: it’s a metaphysical
critique, it’s a normative critique, it’s</a>
01:24:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h24m12s">a political critique, it’s an epistemological
set of views. And so the alternative then</a>
01:24:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h24m17s">also has to be integrated philosophically.
There has to be an entire philosophical package—so</a>
01:24:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h24m24s">what label is going to capture all of that
and at the same time make a connection to</a>
01:24:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h24m32s">postmodernism—and also, I’m basically
an optimistic positive guy, so I want something</a>
01:24:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h24m38s">that has a positive …</a>
01:24:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h24m40s">Yes, illuminates the pathway forward.</a>
01:24:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h24m42s">Yes, that’s right, yes. Making the world
a better place</a>
01:24:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h24m47s">Right. Exactly, exactly. So look—I think
an hour-and-a-half interview is approximately</a>
01:24:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h24m53s">the equivalent of a 200-page book.</a>
01:24:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h24m55s">So we’re done.</a>
01:24:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h24m57s">Why don’t we end with that, and what I would
like to propose is that we have another discussion</a>
01:24:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h25m04s">in a couple of months about what you’re
thinking about with regards to what you’re</a>
01:25:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h25m10s">writing now.</a>
01:25:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h25m11s">So, like, we’ve covered the intellectual
territory; we’ve covered the historical</a>
01:25:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h25m15s">territory; and done a reasonably good job
I think of both “justifying” postmodernism</a>
01:25:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h25m21s">in this discussion, and also pointing out
its pitfalls and dangers.</a>
01:25:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h25m25s">Sure, yes.</a>
01:25:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h25m26s">We haven’t outlined much for an alternative
vision except making tangential reference</a>
01:25:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h25m34s">to the potency of individual capacity, but
that would seem to be reasonable grounds for</a>
01:25:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h25m42s">the next discussion. So …</a>
01:25:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h25m43s">What else would be worth, next time we chat,
talking about are the current culture war</a>
01:25:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h25m48s">issues. You know, one of the things I’m
very interested in is younger people in particular</a>
01:25:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h25m53s">who are in the front lines in universities,
so to speak, and they’re surrounded and</a>
01:25:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h25m59s">bewildered and angry, and in some cases, intimidated
by all of this “micro-aggressions” and</a>
01:25:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h26m06s">so forth, and in some cases the indoctrination
they’re getting …</a>
01:26:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h26m08s">But I’m actually kind of glad that we didn’t
talk about the more political end of it today,</a>
01:26:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h26m13s">because it enabled us to have a conversation
that was almost entirely philosophical in</a>
01:26:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h26m17s">nature, and I really think that’s the right
level of analysis, because the battle that’s</a>
01:26:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h26m23s">occurring in our culture is actually occurring
at a philosophical level. I mean, there’s</a>
01:26:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h26m27s">other levels as well, but that’s even more
important than the political level as far</a>
01:26:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h26m32s">as I’m concerned.</a>
01:26:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h26m33s">Well said. I agree one-hundred percent. Nicely
put.</a>
01:26:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h26m37s">All right. Well, it was a pleasure speaking
with you—it was very much worthwhile.</a>
01:26:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h26m39s">For me too, thanks much.</a>
01:26:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h26m40s">You have a remarkable capacity for tracking
the content of conversations and keeping them</a>
01:26:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h26m45s">on point, so that’s quite amazing to see,
because we did branch out in a lot of different</a>
01:26:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h26m49s">directions, more or less simultaneously, and
it was quite helpful in keeping the conversation</a>
01:26:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h26m55s">on track that you could so rapidly organize
the … You know, it was almost like you were</a>
01:26:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h27m00s">putting a paragraph structure in the conversation
as it occurred, so that was something that</a>
01:27:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h27m04s">was really interesting to see.</a>
01:27:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h27m05s">So, anyways, it was a pleasure meeting you,
and thanks very much for talking with me.</a>
01:27:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h27m09s">I’ll obviously put a link … I’ve been
recommending your book like …</a>
01:27:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h27m12s">My pleasure. Much respect for the work you’re
doing. Thanks for having me on your show,</a>
01:27:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h27m17s">and will be happy to talk again.</a>
01:27:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h27m19s">Great. Good. We’ll set that up.</a>
01:27:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzSrtr6oJE#t=01h27m21s">All right. Thanks Jordan. Bye.</a>
