00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h00m03s">And I was interested in motivation for social conflict, primarily.</a>
00:00:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h00m07s">And at the time I took my degree-- and I suppose it's probably similar now--</a>
00:00:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h00m12s">all the explanations for social conflict were economic.</a>
00:00:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h00m16s">People are basically fighting over resources of one form or another.</a>
00:00:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h00m20s">And that just struck me as wrong.</a>
00:00:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h00m24s">It's too simple.</a>
00:00:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h00m26s">And it also doesn't explain why people value certain resources.</a>
00:00:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h00m31s">It's not self-evident that a resource has value.</a>
00:00:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h00m35s">It depends very much on the cultural context.</a>
00:00:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h00m38s">And it is-- also didn't seem to me to take into account the relationship</a>
00:00:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h00m42s">between belief and the individual.</a>
00:00:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h00m45s">It was a purely economic explanation-- plus,</a>
00:00:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h00m47s">then it's also predicated on an essentially economic view of men.</a>
00:00:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h00m50s">It wasn't deep enough to really explain the issue.</a>
00:00:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h00m53s">And at that time, too, it was in the early 80s</a>
00:00:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h00m57s">when I really started to think about this,</a>
00:00:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h00m59s">it was sort of the second peak of the Cold War.</a>
00:00:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h01m01s">And people were very, very worried about nuclear destruction.</a>
00:01:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h01m06s">You know, it was a constant background concern.</a>
00:01:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h01m09s">And so part of what I was curious about was</a>
00:01:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h01m14s">how belief could be important enough so that people</a>
00:01:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h01m16s">would be willing to put life itself at risk to have produced this insane</a>
00:01:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h01m23s">standoff with these tens of thousands of nuclear weapons.</a>
00:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h01m27s">And then there was something beyond that too</a>
00:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h01m28s">because you can explain some of that with just just with territoriality,</a>
00:01:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h01m33s">but there was more-- there was an element of gratuitous violence</a>
00:01:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h01m36s">that characterize situations like those in Nazi Germany,</a>
00:01:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h01m41s">and also in the Stalinist camps, and in lots of other places as well.</a>
00:01:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h01m45s">But those were the two that really stood out for me</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h01m48s">that I felt couldn't be explained by--</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h01m50s">well, certainly not by a resource theory, or even really by a theory</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h01m55s">that had anything to do with territoriality.</a>
00:01:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h01m57s">There was some other element that was more metaphysical that</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h02m02s">wasn't being attended to.</a>
00:02:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h02m03s">You just couldn't account for those sorts of things.</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h02m06s">You know, it's one thing to kill people.</a>
00:02:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h02m08s">You can even make a rational account for that under many circumstances.</a>
00:02:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h02m12s">But to make them as miserable as possible while you're killing them,</a>
00:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h02m17s">and then also to do it in a manner that's counterproductive with regards</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h02m20s">to your own ends-- because that clearly happened in Nazi Germany--</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h02m24s">that's not-- there's no straightforward rational explanation for that.</a>
00:02:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h02m29s">So I started reading more and more about that.</a>
00:02:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h02m32s">There was something about, especially, the archetypes</a>
00:02:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h02m35s">of the collective unconscious, reading that in relationship</a>
00:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h02m37s">to the Gulag Archipelago, that I felt that there was something there</a>
00:02:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h02m40s">that really bore further investigation.</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h02m44s">You know, when Solzhenitsyn, for example, he</a>
00:02:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h02m47s">concentrated a lot on the relationship between individual deceit,</a>
00:02:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h02m54s">particularly, lying, to put it simply, and the path elegies of the state.</a>
00:02:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h02m59s">Makes a very clear case for that.</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h03m01s">And I always sort of interpreted Freud's idea of a repression as a form of lie.</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h03m06s">Now, I don't think his account of repression is correct.</a>
00:03:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h03m11s">But it doesn't matter.</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h03m12s">It's interestingly wrong, at least, or it's approximately right,</a>
00:03:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h03m16s">something like that.</a>
00:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h03m17s">And then there was a weird connection between this idea</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h03m22s">of the lie as the root of pathology in totalitarian states</a>
00:03:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h03m28s">and archetypal religious ideas that were associated</a>
00:03:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h03m33s">with the idea of good and evil.</a>
00:03:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h03m34s">And so that started to attract my attention.</a>
00:03:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h03m38s">I was probably about 20.</a>
00:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h03m42s">It was 1982.</a>
00:03:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h03m43s">Yeah, I was 20.</a>
00:03:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h03m44s">And I was also reading Nietzsche at that time.</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h03m46s">And I read everything that he wrote that--</a>
00:03:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h03m49s">of his major works.</a>
00:03:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h03m50s">I mean, the whole collected works hadn't been published yet,</a>
00:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h03m52s">but I read him in chronological order.</a>
00:03:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h03m56s">And that was extremely interesting for me, as well.</a>
00:03:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h03m58s">And there's a very interesting intellectual relationship</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h04m01s">between Nietzsche and Jung and Solzhenitsyn.</a>
00:04:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h04m04s">The Solzhenitsyn connection is more through Dostoevsky.</a>
00:04:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h04m08s">You know, when Dostoevsky and Jung, or Nietzsche,</a>
00:04:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h04m10s">were investigating very, very similar ideas at exactly the same time.</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h04m15s">So there's these weird parallelisms of thought.</a>
00:04:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h04m18s">And although people don't know it well, Jung</a>
00:04:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h04m22s">was extremely influenced by Nietzsche, just as much as by Freud.</a>
00:04:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h04m26s">I mean, there is a publication, for example,</a>
00:04:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h04m29s">that's notes on his seminar on Thus Spoke Zarathustra,</a>
00:04:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h04m34s">and it's like 2,600 pages long.</a>
00:04:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h04m36s">And it only covers the first third of Thus Spoke Zarathustra.</a>
00:04:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h04m39s">So Jung was very interested in Nietzsche.</a>
00:04:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h04m42s">So this-- I found this source of ideas, which I suppose</a>
00:04:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h04m45s">was grounded in some sense in 19th century romanticism, that</a>
00:04:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h04m49s">seemed to really get at the root of the question as far as I was concerned.</a>
00:04:49</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h05m34s">that there were patterns of action and perception in a sense,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h05m43s">that lie at the bottom of our thoughts.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h06m00s">You know, one thing Jung said-- which I really love--</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h06m09s">That's a really interesting way of looking.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h06m12s">It's like Richard Dawkins' idea of meme.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h06m14s">It's funny to read Dawkins because Dawkins</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h06m19s">he could read Jung because his idea of memes and the archetypes</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h06m23s">are very, very close, except the meme is a trivial concept compared</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h06m26s">to the archetype.</a>
00:06:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h06m27s">So an archetype is like meta meme, in a sense.</a>
00:06:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h06m31s">It's deep.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h06m38s">So Dawkins, even though he's an evolutionary thinker,</a>
00:06:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h06m45s">is still like post-enlightenment rationalist.</a>

00:06:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h06m53s">Well, you're too concerned with rationality.</a>
00:06:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h06m56s">Rationality is new.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h07m03s">Anyway, so I was obsessed with the idea of destruction and the will to destroy,</a>
00:07:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h07m12s">fundamentally, and its expression and totalitarianism,</a>
00:07:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h07m15s">and then, its relationship with the history of ideas, in general.</a>
00:07:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h07m19s">That's partly why I found Nietzsche so useful because Nietzsche</a>
00:07:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h07m22s">predicted that the 20th century would be a war, in some sense, between--</a>
00:07:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h07m27s">well, certainly a war that would involve communist ideas.</a>
00:07:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h07m33s">He predicted that in about 1860, something like that, in Will to Power.</a>
00:07:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h07m38s">He said, you know, we'll pay for that conflict</a>
00:07:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h07m41s">with a couple of tens of millions of lives,</a>
00:07:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h07m45s">which is quite the prognostication like, 30 years before the fact.</a>
00:07:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h07m50s">And then he also talked about nihilism and both of those as a reaction</a>
00:07:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h07m55s">to the collapse of Christianity.</a>
00:07:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h07m58s">And that struck me as highly plausible.</a>
00:07:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h08m04s">So Nietzsche was also extremely useful.</a>
00:08:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h08m06s">One of the things about Jung is that Jung spent his whole career trying</a>
00:08:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h08m10s">to answer Nietzsche's question.</a>
00:08:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h08m13s">So Nietzsche said, basically, that the conflict between enlightenment thinking</a>
00:08:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h08m20s">and religious thinking--</a>
00:08:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h08m21s">Christian thinking, in particular-- was going</a>
00:08:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h08m23s">to wipe Christian thinking out, or at least people's ability</a>
00:08:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h08m26s">to believe in the metaphysical assumptions that underlie Christianity,</a>
00:08:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h08m29s">and that the only proper response to that</a>
00:08:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h08m32s">would be nihilism, which he was very much concerned with,</a>
00:08:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h08m35s">or authoritarianism.</a>
00:08:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h08m38s">And so Nietzsche was trying to develop a philosophy</a>
00:08:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h08m44s">of what might constitute a third path.</a>
00:08:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h08m49s">And that's expressed to some degree in Thus</a>
00:08:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h08m51s">Spoke Zarathustra with the idea of the Superman or the Overman.</a>
00:08:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h08m54s">But that idea really never got developed.</a>
00:08:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h08m58s">In fact, Jung believed that the development of that idea</a>
00:08:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h09m01s">was part of what drove Nietzsche insane.</a>
00:09:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h09m04s">He thought that he developed a kind of schizophrenic inflation.</a>
00:09:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h09m10s">Jung believed that inflation was the invasion of the conscious ego</a>
00:09:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h09m15s">with archetypal content.</a>
00:09:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h09m17s">And so it's almost like, when the old hero dies, a new hero was born.</a>
00:09:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h09m23s">And that new hero, in some sense, was born within Nietzsche consciousness.</a>
00:09:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h09m28s">But those are experiences that are powerful enough, in some sense,</a>
00:09:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h09m33s">to have a psychotic element to them.</a>
00:09:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h09m35s">And anyways, Nietzsche died before he developed those ideas very far.</a>
00:09:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h09m38s">But then Jung spent his entire career, in some sense,</a>
00:09:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h09m42s">trying to understand hero mythology fundamentally.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h12m29s">too because if you want to argue that religion is only superstition,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h12m34s">you collect up all the superstitions, you define them as religious,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h12m52s">And there's also a big difference between explaining and explaining away.</a>
00:12:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h12m57s">So well, Dennett likes to explain away things, like consciousness.</a>
00:12:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h13m03s">And you can't explain away consciousness.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h13m05s">Well, you can.</a>
00:13:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h13m06s">It depends on how you structure your initial presumptions about the world.</a>
00:13:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h13m11s">So the logos that we were talking about earlier that's associated with, let's</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h13m15s">say, articulated truth, and the communication</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h13m18s">of articulated truth, that's basically the prime function of consciousness.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h13m24s">And the Judeo Christian story is predicated on the idea</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h13m29s">that that is a fundamental element of being.</a>
00:13:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h13m34s">Now, you can structure your world with different presuppositions.</a>
00:13:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h13m37s">So you could say, well, consciousness is epi-phenomena of the material world.</a>
00:13:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h13m42s">Well, you can make a perfectly coherent and useful set</a>
00:13:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h13m46s">of tools out of those pre-suppositions.</a>
00:13:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h13m48s">But that set of tools does not cover everything that you need.</a>
00:13:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h13m53s">And it's no more viable as an explanation than the explanation</a>
00:13:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h13m57s">that no consciousness is somehow fundamental to being.</a>
00:13:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h14m01s">And of course, being is different than material reality.</a>
00:14:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h14m06s">So-- and these things aren't grappled with properly</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h14m34s">So it's a straw man argument.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h24m03s">it's not progress-- continual survival is that the underlying environment</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h24m13s">By its essential nature, it's unpredictable.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h24m32s">So what that means in part is that the environment, so to speak,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h29m50s">They were very excited about it.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h29m52s">So and they got excited about it because the Darwinian claim is things</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h30m04s">It's because you couldn't have the knowledge, even hypothetically,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h30m20s">in the sense that any explanation of the complexity of the system</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h30m31s">Well, yeah, you could think about it as-- that's right,</a>
00:30:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h30m33s">you can think about it as a limitation of the perceiver.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h30m38s">The problem too is that whatever knowledge you accrue</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h30m43s">It's like trying to predict the stock market, which isn't possible.</a>

00:30:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h30m47s">So I think that's a really good example, actually.</a>
00:30:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h30m51s">And you know, try to predict the stock market rationally.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h30m55s">Well, you might say, well, it's not real.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h31m20s">The fundamentals of truth are those that guide action.</a>
00:31:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h31m24s">And then the object of science is nested inside that.</a>
00:31:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h31m28s">It has to be.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h31m30s">So that is really central because everything--</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h31m33s">in my mind-- everything in Maps of Meaning and a lot of your other work</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h31m45s">And let's do it from a Darwinian perspective.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h31m47s">OK.</a>
00:31:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h31m48s">So first of all, there's the single celled animals.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h31m53s">We'll say, well, we don't have to talk about them.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h32m30s">And then maybe there's 100 lobsters in the same space.</a>
00:32:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h32m32s">So then the question becomes how do you organize lobster behavior</a>
00:32:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h32m36s">when most of the environment consists of other lobsters behaving?</a>
00:32:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h32m41s">And the answer to that has been you put it-- you make a dominance hierarchy.</a>
00:32:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h32m45s">And then the dominance hierarchy--</a>
00:32:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h32m49s">the way you adapt to the dominance hierarchy</a>
00:32:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h32m52s">is by noting the patterns of behavior that compose it,</a>
00:32:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h32m56s">and by first internalizing those.</a>
00:32:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h33m01s">Let's say, modeling them-- to the degree that that's possible.</a>
00:33:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h33m04s">But even more remarkably, over huge expanses of time,</a>
00:33:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h33m10s">because the dominance hierarchy and its patterns</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h33m13s">are a fundamental element of reality, you</a>
00:33:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h33m15s">start to adapt biologically to the dominance hierarchy.</a>
00:33:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h33m19s">So OK.</a>
00:33:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h33m20s">So now what we've got is we've got an emergent set of social behaviors.</a>
00:33:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h33m25s">OK.</a>
00:33:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h33m26s">They're not rules because they're not rules till you observe them,</a>
00:33:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h33m29s">or till you codify them, or til you articulate them.</a>
00:33:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h33m32s">What they are is the patterns from which rules emerge.</a>
00:33:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h33m38s">And they are deep patterns.</a>
00:33:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h33m40s">So then you might say, OK, what are the rules</a>
00:33:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h33m43s">for staying alive in a dominance hierarchy,</a>
00:33:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h33m45s">not being torn apart by your conspecifics.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h33m48s">And that's learning quickly who can tear you into pieces</a>

00:33:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h33m59s">And you'd better learn that fast.</a>
00:33:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h34m01s">And you want to learn it with the minimum possible amount of damage</a>
00:34:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h34m05s">because that's another problem that social creatures have,</a>
00:34:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h34m08s">or at least creatures that are in a dominance hierarchy.</a>
00:34:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h34m10s">It gets even more complicated when the members of the dominance hierarchy</a>
00:34:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h34m13s">start to cooperate.</a>
00:34:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h34m15s">But lobsters, as far as we know--</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h34m17s">as far as I know-- don't cooperate.</a>
00:34:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h34m19s">But still, like, their behavior is very, very determined</a>
00:34:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h34m23s">by the nature of the dominance hierarchy.</a>
00:34:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h34m26s">OK.</a>
00:34:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h34m26s">So what that is the patterns that govern a dominance hierarchy are</a>
00:34:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h34m31s">the place from which ethics derive.</a>
00:34:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h34m35s">Right?</a>
00:34:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h34m35s">And they evolved.</a>
00:34:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h34m38s">And they're not arbitrary.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h34m39s">That's the other thing.</a>
00:34:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h34m40s">What works in one dominance hierarchy works in another.</a>
00:34:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h34m43s">And so you might say, well, what's your proof for that?</a>
00:34:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h34m46s">And why would say, well, one of my proofs for that</a>
00:34:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h34m48s">is that we use the same brain chemical and the same neurological system,</a>
00:34:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h34m56s">roughly speaking, to keep track of our position in the dominant hierarchy</a>
00:34:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h35m00s">as lobsters do.</a>
00:35:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h35m01s">And that's 300 million years of continuity.</a>
00:35:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h35m05s">So that's real enough as far as I'm concerned.</a>
00:35:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h35m11s">OK.</a>
00:35:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h35m12s">So now you've got your lobsters, and find they organize themselves</a>
00:35:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h35m15s">according to these rules.</a>
00:35:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h35m16s">And the top lobster is confident and makes himself big.</a>
00:35:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h35m21s">And he's the one that gets all the chicks.</a>
00:35:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h35m23s">So your success in the dominance hierarchy, especially if you're male,</a>
00:35:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h35m28s">also determines the probability of your reproduction.</a>
00:35:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h35m31s">And it may determine that more than anything else.</a>
00:35:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h35m34s">So how to maneuver in the dominance hierarchy</a>
00:35:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h35m37s">might be the prime question that faces creatures</a>
00:35:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h35m41s">that have to live with conspecifics.</a>
00:35:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h35m44s">And the females, in some sense, use the dominant hierarchy</a>
00:35:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h35m47s">as a distributed computational device to determine the worth of the males.</a>
00:35:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h35m53s">So because what the females do is they sort of hang off to the side,</a>
00:35:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h35m56s">and they watch the males battle it out.</a>
00:35:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h35m58s">And then they just pick from the top.</a>
00:35:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h36m00s">Now, they have their own hierarchy.</a>
00:36:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h36m02s">And you know, it runs by somewhat different rules.</a>
00:36:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h36m04s">But it's very smart.</a>
00:36:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h36m05s">It's-- they're externalizing the cognitive problem to the structure</a>
00:36:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h36m08s">itself.</a>
00:36:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h36m13s">So then there's the rules that govern the dominance</a>
00:36:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h36m15s">hierarchy, the simple one, which is just where they are the same animals,</a>
00:36:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h36m19s">but they're competing.</a>
00:36:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h36m20s">But then, when you get a little farther along, you know, maybe</a>
00:36:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h36m23s">to the point where animals are hunting together, that might be it,</a>
00:36:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h36m28s">or caretaking, something like that, anyways,</a>
00:36:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h36m30s">where cooperative behavior emerges.</a>
00:36:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h36m33s">OK, now a different rule start to apply because--</a>
00:36:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h36m37s">like in a wolf pack, let's say.</a>
00:36:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h36m40s">The wolf still wants to get to the top, but he</a>
00:36:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h36m43s">doesn't want to tear every one to pieces as he climbs to the top</a>
00:36:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h36m46s">because if he did that, then he won't be in a pack.</a>
00:36:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h36m48s">And then that's not going to work.</a>
00:36:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h36m50s">He's going to starve to death.</a>
00:36:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h36m52s">So that really gets complicated.</a>
00:36:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h36m54s">It's like, you can defeat someone, but you can't destroy them.</a>
00:36:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h37m01s">OK.</a>
00:37:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h37m01s">There's another more rule.</a>
00:37:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h37m03s">You can defeat someone, but you can't destroy them.</a>
00:37:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h37m06s">So you might say, well, that's a rule that emerges spontaneously</a>
00:37:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h37m10s">as a consequence of social interactions under biological control.</a>
00:37:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h37m14s">And once the rule emerges, the dominance hierarchy</a>
00:37:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h37m19s">lasts long enough so evolutionary pressure</a>
00:37:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h37m22s">can start to operate to ensure that creatures within that system</a>
00:37:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h37m27s">build their ability to follow that rule into their nervous systems.</a>
00:37:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h37m31s">Because it's the main selection force, whether they're successful at it.</a>
00:37:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h37m37s">So what seems to be arbitrary and social can become built in</a>
00:37:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h37m41s">and biological I think faster than we understand</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h37m44s">because the consequences of being victorious in the dominance hierarchy</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h37m48s">are so high.</a>
00:37:48</p>

00:42:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h42m13s">you want to climb the hierarchy, you want to climb it</a>
00:42:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h42m15s">without being hurt too much.</a>
00:42:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h42m17s">You don't want to blow the straps out of your group.</a>
00:42:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h42m20s">And you want to stay there as long as possible.</a>
00:42:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h42m22s">OK.</a>
00:42:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h42m23s">So that's a niche.</a>
00:42:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h42m24s">Think about that.</a>
00:42:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h42m24s">That's a niche.</a>
00:42:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h42m25s">It's complicated because the niche involves success in climbing,</a>
00:42:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h42m29s">and then it involves success in maintaining an uppermost position.</a>
00:42:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h42m34s">OK.</a>
00:42:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h42m36s">And that, for chimps, that requires not only the capacity to be aggressive,</a>
00:42:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h42m40s">but also the capacity to be co-operative and empathic.</a>
00:42:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h42m44s">So one of the things de Waall discovered, for example,</a>
00:42:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h42m46s">is that the chimp who stays on top, first of all, can make coalitions.</a>
00:42:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h42m52s">So there's a lot of reciprocal grooming and so on.</a>
00:42:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h42m54s">So he can make friends, even though he's kind of-- you know, he's tough.</a>
00:42:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h42m58s">But he also pays a lot of attention to the females</a>
00:42:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h43m00s">and the infants in the troop.</a>
00:43:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h43m03s">So whatever constitutes sovereignty, let's say, from a chimp perspective,</a>
00:43:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h43m07s">is a lot more complex than mere power.</a>
00:43:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h43m10s">OK.</a>
00:43:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h43m10s">So fine.</a>
00:43:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h43m11s">So that's chimps.</a>
00:43:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h43m11s">Now, we're chimps.</a>
00:43:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h43m12s">So you already got the origin of human ethics to some degree in that.</a>
00:43:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h43m16s">It's like, get to the top, but don't be too much of a prick</a>
00:43:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h43m20s">when you're there, so to speak, right?</a>
00:43:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h43m23s">You have to rule while making allowances for those--</a>
00:43:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h43m30s">and make allowances for the fact that those you rule over have value.</a>
00:43:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h43m35s">Now, that's an interesting thing because now what you've done</a>
00:43:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h43m38s">is if you've introduced the-- not the idea, but the fact</a>
00:43:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h43m42s">that even a defeated other is a valuable part of the group.</a>
00:43:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h43m47s">OK.</a>
00:43:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h43m48s">Now, that's starting to get morality there, started to get fairly deep</a>
00:43:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h43m51s">because that's kind of like, well, the outcast still has value.</a>
00:43:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h43m55s">OK.</a>
00:43:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h43m56s">Now, you come to human beings and you think, OK, well, what's--</a>
00:43:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h43m59s">what makes a human being successful in the dominance hierarchy?</a>
00:43:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h44m03s">You can say, well, it's the same thing the chimps have.</a>
00:44:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h44m06s">And that's right, except that human beings have one other thing, at least.</a>
00:44:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h44m13s">They can make new dominance hierarchy.</a>
00:44:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h44m15s">That's what creativity is, right?</a>
00:44:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h44m16s">So you invent a new something, and you can erect a dominance hierarchy</a>
00:44:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h44m20s">around it.</a>
00:44:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h44m21s">So if you can't climb the dominant hierarchy that's already here,</a>
00:44:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h44m24s">you can just say well, here's a new thing,</a>
00:44:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h44m25s">and we'll make it a little dominant hierarchy over there.</a>
00:44:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h44m28s">So now you've got the addition of the capacity</a>
00:44:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h44m31s">to transform the dominance hierarchy as another thing that's contributing</a>
00:44:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h44m35s">to dominance hierarchy success.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h44m37s">OK.</a>
00:44:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h44m37s">So I believe that what's come out of that is the idea that--</a>
00:44:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h44m43s">this is such a great idea-- is that the top of the dominance hierarchy</a>
00:44:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h44m48s">is the right place to be.</a>
00:44:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h44m50s">But the top of all potential sets of dominance hierarchies</a>
00:44:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h44m55s">is a better place to be.</a>
00:44:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h44m57s">And I think we're selected to be the top of the set of potential dominance</a>
00:44:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h45m03s">hierarchies.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h45m04s">And that means, in some sense, if you're at the top,</a>
00:45:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h45m06s">you're not at the top of a dominance hierarchy.</a>

00:45:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h45m11s">So now imagine this.</a>
00:45:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h45m12s">So now imagine a landscape.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h45m14s">OK.</a>
00:45:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h45m15s">As far as you can see it's a plane.</a>
00:45:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h45m17s">And there's pyramids all over it of different sizes, right?</a>
00:45:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h45m20s">And you're flying above it.</a>
00:45:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h45m22s">You zoom in to a pyramid.</a>
00:45:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h45m24s">And you see all people packed inside, trying to climb to the top.</a>
00:45:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h45m27s">But there's pyramids everywhere where people are doing this.</a>
00:45:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h45m30s">But you're flying along the top.</a>
00:45:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h45m33s">OK, well, that's-- as far as I can tell-- that's the Egyptian god Horus.</a>
00:45:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h45m40s">Horus isn't in the pyramid.</a>
00:45:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h45m41s">He's above the pyramid.</a>
00:45:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h45m44s">And he's the Eye, because Horus is the Eye.</a>
00:45:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h45m47s">And so Horus stands for attention.</a>
00:45:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h45m49s">And so there's this idea that the Egyptians</a>
00:45:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h45m51s">start to play with that one of the most important gods is Osiris.</a>
00:45:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h45m56s">And he's like god of the pyramid.</a>
00:45:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h45m58s">He stands for security and stability and the past.</a>
00:45:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h46m02s">But he can be wiped out by various means.</a>
00:46:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h46m05s">So he's not permanent enough in some sense, or he lacks something.</a>
00:46:05</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h46m10s">So Osiris is the father, yeah, the Great Father.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h46m29s">So the Egyptians are starting to get the idea that well, you should be Osiris.</a>
00:46:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h46m34s">That means you are the embodiment of the dominance hierarchy, say.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h48m37s">But then it sort of gets commingled in with some other stories</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h49m56s">So Osiris remains willfully blind and he let Seth basically chop him into pieces</a>

00:56:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h56m48s">Well, and the answer to that would be twofold.</a>
00:56:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h56m54s">What are you trying to do with your speech?</a>
00:56:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h56m57s">There's two things you can do with it.</a>
00:56:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h56m58s">One is you can manipulate reality so that it does what you want it to do.</a>
00:56:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h57m04s">And that's the sort of speech that people use when</a>
00:57:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h57m06s">they're trying to get what they want.</a>
00:57:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h57m08s">The problem with that is that there's no way that they can actually</a>
00:57:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h57m13s">know what they want.</a>
00:57:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h57m14s">They just hypothesize what it is that they want based on some theory,</a>
00:57:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h57m19s">and then they try to manipulate the world so that they get that.</a>
00:57:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h57m22s">But it's an unsatisfying venture.</a>
00:57:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h57m23s">And often, when they do get it, it's not good anyways.</a>
00:57:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h57m27s">So it involves a kind of falsity of speech.</a>
00:57:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h57m30s">The other way is to try to say what you mean and think and perceive as clearly</a>
00:57:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h57m37s">as you possibly can, always, and see what happens.</a>
00:57:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h57m41s">Now, the story that underlies Christianity--</a>
00:57:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h57m44s">and it's not only Christianity, but it's Christianity that I'm most familiar</a>
00:57:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h57m47s">with--</a>
00:57:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h57m48s">is that.</a>
00:57:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h57m49s">The rule is live in accordance with the truth and see what happens.</a>
00:57:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h57m55s">So in the Sermon on the Mount, for example, Christ basically says--</a>
00:57:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h58m02s">set your sights on allegiance to God.</a>
00:58:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h58m06s">It's like, whatever the highest value is, we'll say.</a>
00:58:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h58m09s">And act in a manner that's concordant with that.</a>
00:58:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h58m13s">So that's your goal.</a>
00:58:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h58m14s">Then pay attention to it here and now, your best strategy for the future.</a>
00:58:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h58m21s">Then you might say, well, prove that.</a>
00:58:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h58m23s">Well, that that's when the question starts to become existential.</a>
00:58:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h58m26s">It's like, well, you can't prove it.</a>
00:58:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h58m27s">You have to try it.</a>
00:58:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h58m28s">That's like Kierkegaard's leap of faith.</a>
00:58:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h58m31s">You cannot tell if this works unless you do it.</a>
00:58:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h58m35s">And that's a commitment.</a>
00:58:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h58m36s">It's like, those two ways of being, like the manipulative way of being.</a>
00:58:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h58m40s">That's an adversarial way of being archetypally.</a>
00:58:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h58m42s">It's Manipulative It's got the lie at its core.</a>
00:58:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h58m46s">That's completely different than this path.</a>
00:58:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h58m51s">So it's a hypothesis.</a>
00:58:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h58m52s">Well, it's a hypothesis that Jung did a good job of elaborating,</a>
00:58:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h58m55s">although you know, even with Jung it's not fully articulated.</a>

00:59:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h59m02s">But no wonder-- it's very complicated to make this sort of thing fully</a>
00:59:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h59m06s">articulated.</a>

00:59:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h59m19s">Well, that isn't a hypothesis that you hear every day.</a>
00:59:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h59m22s">So then you think about Freud, and you think, well,</a>
00:59:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h59m24s">what's the major cause of mental illness?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h59m28s">Well, that's a lie, fundamentally.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h59m31s">I mean, Freud's played around with it to some degree.</a>
00:59:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=00h59m35s">So it's sort of like, it's more like lying by omission actually</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h00m29s">so that you can maybe get what you hypothetically want out of it.</a>

01:16:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h16m44s">So they acted out the eternal battle between attention,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h23m58s">So there's-- Piaget had this idea of equilibration.</a>

01:24:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h24m07s">Piaget's motivation-- was to bridge the gap between science and religion.</a>
01:24:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h24m11s">And he had very intense messianic experiences when he was a young man.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h24m17s">Piaget's way more interesting that you think.</a>
01:24:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h24m19s">Piaget was very interested in the origin of morality.</a>
01:24:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h24m22s">And he traced the origin of morality back, in some sense,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h24m27s">to the rules that govern social interactions.</a>

01:24:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h24m30s">So you can think Piaget thought it really</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h24m40s">So that was kind of Piaget's definition of a game.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h24m43s">It's like, there's a bunch of people cooperating and competing</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h29m38s">Well, males, females, and you.</a>
01:29:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h29m43s">OK.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h29m43s">So we're going to say, what's the world made out of?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h29m46s">Males, females, and you.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h29m50s">Why is the world made out of that?</a>
01:29:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h29m52s">Because no matter where you go, no matter</a>
01:29:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h29m54s">when, no matter how far back in time, those are things you can rely on.</a>
01:29:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h30m00s">So now we have this circuit.</a>
01:30:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h30m02s">It's the brain.</a>
01:30:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h30m03s">It's like, well, what are males like?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h30m05s">What are females like?</a>
01:30:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h30m07s">And what are we like?</a>
01:30:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h30m08s">And how do we interact?</a>
01:30:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h30m09s">OK.</a>
01:30:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h30m10s">So there you get the constituent elements of reality.</a>
01:30:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h30m12s">So first of all, it's just social.</a>
01:30:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h30m14s">But it's complex because the males aren't just singular figures.</a>
01:30:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h30m18s">Like, the father isn't an individual.</a>
01:30:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h30m22s">The father is the whole patriarchal dominance hierarchy, right?</a>
01:30:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h30m26s">The individual is just a representation of that.</a>
01:30:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h30m29s">So our minds are more evolved to consider masculinity as such,</a>
01:30:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h30m33s">rather than the male individual.</a>
01:30:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h30m35s">Jung would say of Freud's problem patients</a>
01:30:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h30m39s">that they confused their own fathers with the masculine.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h30m42s">The masculine is like a god.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h30m44s">You say, well, is it a god?</a>
01:30:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h30m46s">It's like, well, it shapes your behavior.</a>
01:30:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h30m48s">It determines your destiny.</a>
01:30:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h30m50s">It determines your fitness.</a>
01:30:50</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h30m54s">That's a good question.</a>
01:30:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h30m57s">Depends on how you describe alive.</a>
01:30:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h31m00s">OK.</a>
01:31:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h31m00s">So we've got this system that can recognize like,</a>
01:31:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h31m03s">the masculine living thing, the feminine living thing, the self living thing.</a>
01:31:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h31m09s">Well, that's the underlying pre-suppositions of our nervous system.</a>
01:31:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h31m14s">That's the world of being.</a>
01:31:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h31m16s">OK.</a>
01:31:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h31m16s">At some point, our cortex inflates.</a>
01:31:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h31m19s">So now we can use abstraction.</a>
01:31:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h31m21s">But you know that evolution is a conservative process.</a>
01:31:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h31m24s">You don't just build a new thing.</a>
01:31:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h31m27s">You build a new thing on an old thing.</a>
01:31:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h31m30s">And so the new thing still thinks like the old thing.</a>
01:31:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h31m32s">But it can do some more things.</a>
01:31:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h31m34s">Well, so, what's happened to us--</a>
01:31:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h31m37s">and this is something that's amazing to me--</a>
01:31:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h31m39s">is that we've taken these basic social cognitive categories,</a>
01:31:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h31m43s">and we've been able to map being itself using the same categories.</a>
01:31:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h31m48s">And it works.</a>
01:31:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h31m50s">You map the masculine onto the dominance hierarchy.</a>
01:31:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h31m53s">You map the feminine on to nature.</a>
01:31:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h31m58s">Well, that works.</a>
01:31:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h31m58s">All of a sudden, that works.</a>
01:31:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h32m00s">It's like, you can survive like that.</a>
01:32:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h32m02s">So you think, well, is that a metaphor?</a>
01:32:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h32m04s">It's like, no.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h32m05s">It's not a metaphor.</a>
01:32:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h32m06s">And here's an example.</a>
01:32:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h32m08s">Why is mother nature mother nature?</a>
01:32:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h32m12s">Well, what's nature?</a>
01:32:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h32m13s">Well, nature is that which selects.</a>
01:32:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h32m17s">That's like as far as I can tell, how else are you going to define nature.</a>
01:32:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h32m21s">Nature selects.</a>
01:32:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h32m23s">Women select.</a>
01:32:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h32m25s">I mean, that's what women do.</a>
01:32:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h32m27s">Human women.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h32m29s">They're selective maters.</a>
01:32:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h32m31s">So as far as men are concerned-- and maybe as far as women are concerned</a>
01:32:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h32m35s">too--</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h32m35s">women are nature.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h34m28s">That's a tougher one because I do think that science does have a qualitative.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h34m40s">And it's because it's this really powerful technique,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h34m47s">Now, that's not exactly what science is about.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h34m50s">It's more like, if we behave in such a way, something will happen.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h35m00s">like a personal perspective, let's say.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h35m16s">We get a new way of describing things.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h35m19s">Well, is that true?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h35m24s">Well, then you get back into the problem of what constitutes truth.</a>
01:35:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h35m28s">Is it useful?</a>

01:35:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h35m35s">Like, we're staking our survival on the presupposition that it's useful.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h35m40s">But it's like, you know, there wouldn't be</a>

01:35:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h35m48s">And it's certainly an anomaly in the natural world.</a>
01:35:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h35m52s">But no one no other creature has science.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h35m56s">Maybe science is fatal.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h35m58s">I mean, it could easily be fatal.</a>
01:35:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h36m01s">So you know, and someone who's a scientist</a>
01:36:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h36m07s">in that sort of ideological sense would say, well, even if it's fatal,</a>
01:36:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h36m11s">it was still true.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h36m13s">It's like, well, it depends on how you define truth.</a>
01:36:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h36m16s">Like, if you're willing to say that fatal is true, well, then go ahead.</a>
01:36:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h36m23s">But I think that's not a good definition of truth.</a>
01:36:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h36m25s">And that's where our disagreement really lies.</a>
01:36:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h36m28s">You have your definition.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h36m29s">I have my definition.</a>

01:36:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h36m34s">So you have to contend with that if you're a scientist.</a>
01:36:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h36m36s">But you might dispute that. although it's not clear to me</a>
01:36:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h36m39s">how you would dispute that.</a>
01:36:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h36m41s">But well, we've already run through that argument.</a>
01:36:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h36m44s">It gets tangled up at the bottom, you know.</a>
01:36:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h36m47s">And I also think part of the problem with strictly--</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h36m50s">with the view that only what is objectively observable is real--</a>
01:36:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h36m55s">which, you can have a science without that presupposition.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h36m59s">You could say only what is objectively true is uniquely useful and valuable.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h37m04s">But it's part of a bunch of things that are uniquely useful and valuable.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h37m10s">It's also dangerous.</a>
01:37:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h37m11s">So we got to keep an eye on it, you know.</a>
01:37:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h37m13s">It's a big tool.</a>
01:37:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h37m15s">Well, that's a perfectly reasonable thing to do.</a>
01:37:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h37m18s">What-- do you take the next step and you say, only that.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h37m21s">Well, then I also think another way, it's</a>
01:37:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h37m23s">like, why are you claiming only that?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h37m25s">You say, well, it's because I'm pursuing truth.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h56m26s">It's like, there's a presupposition at the bottom</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h56m30s">that you have to accept in order to follow the logic.</a>
01:56:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h56m33s">And the presupposition is there are alternative ways</a>
01:56:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h56m37s">of laying out your initial presuppositions</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h56m41s">It's like, well, why should I accept that?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h56m43s">Well, I can't show you why till you accept it because I can't walk you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h56m50s">So the way I did that in Maps of Meaning was</a>
01:56:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h56m52s">that it was kind of like a small circle to begin with, and then a bigger</a>

01:56:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h56m58s">So I could get all the elements described in a simple way,</a>
01:56:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h57m01s">and then make it a little more complex, and then a little more complex.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=01h57m13s">I think largely in part because that basic presupposition is not</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h16m58s">He says, it's a book that's trying to bring about the psychoanalytic closure</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h26m05s">Because when eBay first emerged, people thought, you send me junk</a>
02:26:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h26m09s">and I send you a check that bounces.</a>
02:26:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h26m11s">So that's the end of eBay, right?</a>
02:26:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h26m13s">So these third-party-- I can't remember what they're called--</a>
02:26:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h26m17s">agents set themselves up so that you could pay them a fraction of the price,</a>
02:26:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h26m23s">and they would get the check and the product,</a>
02:26:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h26m25s">validate them, and ship them off.</a>
02:26:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h26m28s">And you know, they'd take 10%, or whatever.</a>
02:26:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h26m31s">There's a particular name for people who do that.</a>
02:26:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h26m33s">It's a profession.</a>
02:26:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h26m34s">Anyways, what happened was the average rate of honesty on eBay</a>
02:26:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h26m37s">was so high that that was useless.</a>
02:26:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h26m39s">It's like, the default was, I won't screw you.</a>
02:26:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h26m43s">And that was between strangers who had never met.</a>
02:26:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h26m46s">And even more weirdly, were never going to engage in another transaction.</a>
02:26:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h26m50s">So what that meant was that eBay all of a sudden</a>
02:26:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h26m52s">became insanely valuable because people would trade property.</a>
02:26:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h26m55s">Now, reputation markers soon evolved.</a>
02:26:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h26m59s">And I do believe that in the West, the default is you won't screw me.</a>
02:26:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h27m06s">And that means that I can trust your persona.</a>
02:27:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h27m09s">If the default is you will screw me, then I'm a barrel of snakes</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h27m13s">and you're a barrel of snakes, and we will never get anywhere.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h27m17s">I mean, if we talk about the state of the world, most of humanity</a>

02:27:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h27m31s">and from what you've extrapolated from your experience for these contexts?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h27m36s">I mean, I can only speak about that at the most general level.</a>
02:27:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h27m40s">Because what to do in any particular circumstance, that's</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h27m52s">It's just the person is caught in something ridiculously complex,</a>
02:27:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h27m57s">like their aunt is sick at home.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h28m07s">No.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h28m07s">It's just awful.</a>
02:28:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h28m09s">So how do you weave your way through an awful situation?</a>
02:28:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h28m13s">Well, the particulars matter a lot.</a>
02:28:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h28m15s">And so you have to do strategic analysis,</a>
02:28:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h28m17s">paying attention to the details.</a>
02:28:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h28m20s">OK.</a>
02:28:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h28m21s">So that's the particular.</a>
02:28:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h28m22s">So what's the general case?</a>
02:28:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h28m24s">Well, the general case is maybe don't falsify your relationship</a>
02:28:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h28m32s">with being to the degree that you can manage that.</a>
02:28:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h28m37s">Now, one of the things that I tell my students is, try solving a problem.</a>
02:28:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h28m44s">Fixing it, not trying to solve a problem.</a>
02:28:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h28m47s">But you know, you're going to fix it.</a>
02:28:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h28m49s">And you can fix it.</a>
02:28:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h28m51s">And it's a problem.</a>
02:28:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h28m53s">And you know it's a problem.</a>
02:28:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h28m54s">OK.</a>
02:28:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h28m55s">So there's like a precondition here.</a>
02:28:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h28m56s">So let's say there's a bunch of things around you that bug you.</a>
02:28:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h29m00s">And you think, hm.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h29m02s">Those things bug me.</a>
02:29:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h29m03s">Why?</a>
02:29:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h29m04s">Well, you don't know, but they bug you.</a>
02:29:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h29m06s">And you might think, well, is one of those things</a>
02:29:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h29m08s">that bug me something I could fix?</a>

02:29:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h29m12s">And there's another part, which is not only could I fix it, I would fix it.</a>
02:29:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h29m17s">Because you can think, well, I could fix that, but I won't.</a>
02:29:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h29m19s">If you're being honest, you know you just won't do it.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h29m22s">But there's often something that you would fix.</a>
02:29:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h29m25s">Start there.</a>
02:29:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h29m26s">Fix it.</a>
02:29:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h29m27s">Then, try again.</a>
02:29:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h29m28s">Try to see if there's something else you can fix.</a>
02:29:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h29m31s">So if you're going to beat the lie, you have to start with what you can do.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h29m38s">And you start locally, like right locally.</a>

02:30:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h30m40s">and then maybe you'll be able to start to address some of the larger problems.</a>
02:30:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h30m45s">Maybe you'll even start to understand what the larger problems are.</a>
02:30:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h30m48s">Because that's a problem with prematurely trying to do too much,</a>
02:30:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h30m51s">right?</a>
02:30:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h30m52s">It's like, well, is that really the problem?</a>
02:30:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h30m54s">And what makes you think you'll make it better rather than worse?</a>
02:30:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h30m56s">So you got to pick the right-sized problem.</a>
02:30:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h30m59s">So I would say, start with little weights and work yourself up.</a>
02:30:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h31m04s">And that's how you develop competence, anyways.</a>
02:31:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h31m06s">If you're going to figure out how to set things straight,</a>
02:31:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h31m10s">you might as well start where you can set them straight.</a>
02:31:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h31m14s">And you might think, well, that's trivial.</a>
02:31:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h31m16s">It's like, it's not trivial.</a>
02:31:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h31m17s">You might think it's trivial.</a>
02:31:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h31m19s">You have no idea how important it might be</a>
02:31:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h31m20s">that you straighten up your relationship with your wife or your son.</a>
02:31:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h31m25s">You have no idea what that might lead to.</a>
02:31:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h31m28s">Just think of what Stalin's relationship with his father led to.</a>
02:31:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h31m33s">Well, it was awful.</a>
02:31:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h31m34s">There's Stalin.</a>
02:31:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h31m35s">He killed like 60 million people.</a>
02:31:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h31m38s">His father was a brute.</a>
02:31:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h31m40s">So that seemed reasonably important.</a>
02:31:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h31m43s">Maybe he shouldn't have been a brute.</a>
02:31:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h31m46s">So you know how horrible things can be if you do things wrong.</a>
02:31:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h31m49s">It's like, well, how good can they be if you do things right?</a>
02:31:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h31m51s">You don't know.</a>
02:31:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h31m52s">Try starting.</a>
02:31:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h31m53s">It's like, see what happens.</a>
02:31:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h31m55s">My experience has been that to the degree</a>
02:31:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h31m59s">that I'm able to speak carefully--</a>
02:31:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h32m04s">and I do speak carefully.</a>
02:32:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h32m06s">And I don't really care about the consequences.</a>
02:32:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h32m10s">It isn't that they don't matter.</a>
02:32:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h32m12s">It's that I'm not speaking to produce a consequence.</a>
02:32:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h32m17s">I'm just trying to say what seems to me to be the case.</a>
02:32:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h32m21s">For me, that's been incredibly, ridiculously, practically useful.</a>
02:32:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h32m28s">Insanely useful.</a>
02:32:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h32m29s">Like it's opened doors that I would have never dreamed of opening.</a>
02:32:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h32m34s">And in my professional life, it's produced all sorts of opportunities.</a>
02:32:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h32m37s">And it's been a real aid in my private life, too.</a>
02:32:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h32m40s">And in my professional life.</a>
02:32:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h32m42s">It's not like I don't make mistakes.</a>
02:32:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h32m44s">I don't think that I am--</a>
02:32:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h32m46s">I would never think of myself as fundamentally a good person.</a>
02:32:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h32m51s">I think maybe I'm fundamentally a bad person.</a>
02:32:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h32m55s">Because you know, I have dark thoughts.</a>
02:32:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h32m56s">And I'm quite temperamental.</a>
02:32:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h33m04s">Anyways.</a>
02:33:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h33m05s">I do what I can to deal with all that.</a>
02:33:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h33m07s">And I don't do it perfectly.</a>
02:33:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h33m08s">And I slide backwards, mostly by avoidance.</a>
02:33:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h33m13s">I don't always stay on top of the things I should stay on top of.</a>
02:33:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h33m16s">But to the degree that I've been able to adhere to this mode of being,</a>
02:33:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h33m25s">I can't think of a single thing that's happened that hasn't been--</a>
02:33:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h33m32s">in some ways, beyond my expectations.</a>
02:33:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h33m36s">And it's really fun talking to the students.</a>
02:33:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h33m39s">Because it's fun with the lectures because when</a>
02:33:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h33m41s">I'm talking about the mythological material,</a>
02:33:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h33m43s">and I can sort of sort out the stories, I can just</a>
02:33:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h33m47s">see lights going on everywhere.</a>
02:33:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h33m48s">It's like, click.</a>
02:33:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h33m49s">You know, you can see it's like--</a>
02:33:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h33m51s">you can tell when someone has an insight.</a>
02:33:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h33m53s">I think they open their eyes a bit more.</a>
02:33:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h33m55s">Maybe that's it because it's a bit of a surprise, so you can detect it.</a>
02:33:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h33m58s">And it is like light going on.</a>
02:33:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h34m00s">And so I'll walk someone, say, through this Egyptian story-- an audience--</a>
02:34:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h34m04s">and they just go click, click, click, click, click, click.</a>
02:34:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h34m07s">It's fun.</a>
02:34:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h34m08s">It's really fun.</a>
02:34:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h34m10s">And people seem to respond to it positively,</a>
02:34:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h34m13s">which I've always been completely surprised about.</a>
02:34:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h34m16s">I can't believe that I've been able to lecture about the things</a>
02:34:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h34m19s">that I lecture about without running mightily afoul of something.</a>
02:34:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h34m24s">Because my classes are quite different than the standard psychology</a>
02:34:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h34m30s">class or the standard university class.</a>
02:34:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h34m32s">They're very different.</a>
02:34:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h34m36s">I don't know.</a>
02:34:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h34m37s">So far, it seems to be working, which is a surprise to me.</a>
02:34:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h34m45s">So that's what I would say to people, is like select the domain</a>
02:34:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h34m50s">in which you can act.</a>
02:34:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h34m51s">Straighten it up first, and that'll transform things a bit.</a>
02:34:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h34m56s">You put your house in order.</a>
02:34:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h34m58s">Then, you can start to put your town in order, or maybe your street,</a>
02:34:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h35m01s">or maybe your neighbor.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h35m02s">God only knows.</a>
02:35:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h35m04s">Start where you can start.</a>
02:35:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h35m07s">And you might think, well, what's that?</a>
02:35:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h35m09s">Well, it's nothing you can wave a placard in the street about, which</a>
02:35:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h35m12s">is a good thing.</a>
02:35:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h35m12s">That's like praying in public.</a>
02:35:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h35m14s">This is more like praying in private.</a>
02:35:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h35m17s">Fix up what you can fix up, and see what happens.</a>
02:35:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis#t=02h35m20s">And I don't think that there's anything that's more powerful than that.</a>
