<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h00m44s">So, it starts up with a simple process, and

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h00m54s">Well, that’s exactly what we did, except
we did it over like three billion years, right?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h00m58s">We started out as these unbelievably simple

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h01m12s">So, that’s how we solved the problem that

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h01m46s">And as scientists, you know, with this 500-year
history of science behind us, we always believe</a>
00:01:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h01m53s">that it’s the material substrate of things

00:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h01m57s">But it is more complicated than that, because
even the material substrate that we consider</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h02m02s">as scientists isn’t merely unformed stuff,
right?</a>
00:02:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h02m07s">It has structure.</a>
00:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h02m08s">It’s patterned.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h02m09s">It’s full of information, and there are

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h02m15s">of the ground of being – the material ground

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h02m20s">fruitful metaphor than conceptualization of
the ground of being as like unformed matter.</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h02m26s">It’s not unformed, right?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h02m28s">It’s patterned and regular.</a>

it reveals order as not just a material structure.</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h02m35s">So, if you go back to Democratus, right, the
person who originated the atomic hypothesis,</a>
00:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h02m40s">Democratus actually says two things – not
one.</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h02m43s">He says: Everything’s made out of atoms
– little bits of stuff.</a>
00:02:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h02m47s">But the other thing he says is: Atoms array
themselves in space array themselves-- And</a>
00:02:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h02m52s">what that means is that the atomic structure
of things is patterned, and that the pattern</a>
00:02:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h02m57s">is just as real as the atoms themselves.</a>
00:02:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h03m00s">It’s the pattern that’s the knowledge,
right?</a>
00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h03m02s">It’s the pattern that’s the information.</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h03m07s">So, what we encounter as conscious beings
is this complexly patterned array, which we</a>
00:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h03m15s">then turn into knowledge – useable knowledge.</a>
00:03:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h03m18s">I said: Well, how would this metaphorical
representation work?</a>
00:03:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h03m22s">And so uh, the way I want you to look at this
figure is like this: Imagine this as distant,</a>
00:03:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h03m27s">right, as lurking in the background.</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h03m29s">So, this is the ground of all being manifesting
itself as one primordial archetype, or one,</a>
00:03:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h03m36s">one metaph-- one standard motive metaphorical
representation.</a>
00:03:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h03m41s">Why this figure?</a>
00:03:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h03m42s">Well, this is complicated, I think.</a>
00:03:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h03m46s">If you show men a picture of a beautiful woman
with her eyes averted, while you’re doing</a>
00:03:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h03m53s">a brain scan mapping of their nucleus accumbens,
nothing happens.</a>
00:03:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h03m58s">Why is that relevant?</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h04m00s">Well, the nucleus accumbens is part of the
underlying emotional circuitry that governs</a>
00:04:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h04m04s">approach behaviour and pleasure.</a>
00:04:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h04m07s">And approach behaviour and pleasure are very
tightly intertwined.</a>
00:04:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h04m10s">If you show the same man a picture of a beautiful
woman with her eyes locked on his, his nucleus</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h04m15s">accumbens will light up.</a>
00:04:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h04m16s">Why is that?</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h04m18s">Well, it’s partly because men are innately
in-- attuned to hu-- to female beauty.</a>
00:04:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h04m24s">Female beauty has a standard form.</a>
00:04:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h04m25s">It’s replicable cross-culturally.</a>
00:04:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h04m27s">It constitutes the average human… human
female form.</a>
00:04:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h04m32s">But more than that, the gaze-locking is an
indication of shared attention.</a>
00:04:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h04m37s">And it’s also the indication of the initial
establishment of a shared attentional space.</a>
00:04:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h04m42s">And it’s an invitation, and that invitation
activates approach circuitry, even if it’s</a>
00:04:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h04m46s">just a picture.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h04m47s">So, and you can see this if you walk into

00:04:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h04m54s">Well, in the men’s magazines, you see an
infinite array of beautiful women.</a>
00:04:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h04m58s">And in the female magazines, the women’s

00:05:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h05m04s">Now, just exactly why is that?</a>
00:05:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h05m05s">Well, there’s something absolutely compelling
about female beauty.</a>
00:05:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h05m09s">And then, you have to ask yourself: What the
hell does compelling mean?</a>
00:05:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h05m13s">OK, so what compelling means is: You’re
busily engaged in a goal-directed task and</a>
00:05:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h05m20s">something happens in your peripheral vision,
so to speak, that attracts your attention.</a>
00:05:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h05m25s">Now, that attention is attracted by processes
that are fundamentally unconscious; which</a>
00:05:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h05m30s">means, processes that occur before you can
think.</a>
00:05:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h05m34s">So, you can imagine a loose collection of
college-aged males having a conversation in</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h13m07s">interesting but… it was also a story that
emerged in solution to a problem I’d been</a>
00:13:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h13m14s">thinking about for a long time because I was
dealing with this guy who didn't wanna grow</a>
00:13:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h13m17s">up, so he’s caught in a kind of Peter Pan
situation and Peter Pan, pan means everything,</a>
00:13:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h13m24s">pan like pantheistic.</a>
00:13:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h13m26s">And Peter Pan is a child who won’t grow

Neverland doesn’t really exist and the lost</a>

of social order.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h13m56s">Hook is always fighting Peter Pan because
Peter Pan represents childhood and vulnerability</a>
00:13:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h14m02s">and he doesn’t wanna be vulnerable so they're
locked in this sort of eternal battle.</a>
00:14:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h14m06s">and lots of people I think more commonly men

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h14m27s">And so this story popped into my head.</a>
00:14:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h14m29s">It’s called Cockadoodledo</a>
00:14:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h14m31s">Once upon a time there was a man who had a
long hard journey ahead of him.</a>
00:14:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h14m35s">He was trudging along the way over waters
and through brushes when he saw little shiny</a>
00:14:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h14m39s">gnome with big white teeth and a black toupee
sitting by the side of the road.</a>
00:14:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h14m44s">He was drumming on a log.</a>
00:14:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h14m46s">With two white bones and humming oddly to
himself.</a>
00:14:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h14m49s">The little gnome said John, why work so hard
why walk so fast.</a>
00:14:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h14m55s">Who knows if you'll ever get there anyway.</a>
00:14:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h14m57s">Come over here I have something to show you.</a>
00:14:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h15m00s">So John walked off the road.</a>
00:15:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h15m02s">He was sick of walking anyway because people
kept throwing sticks and stones at him.</a>
00:15:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h15m06s">Little gnome said I have a shiny red jewel
that I would like to sell you.</a>
00:15:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h15m12s">Cheap.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h15m13s">Here it is.</a>
00:15:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h15m15s">And from beneath his cloak he pulled the biggest
ruby that the man had ever seen.</a>
00:15:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h15m18s">Must’ve weighed 100 pounds and shone like
the sun.</a>
00:15:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h15m23s">The gnome said, do you like it.</a>
00:15:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h15m25s">It’s an enchanted stone, what will you offer
me for it.</a>
00:15:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h15m29s">And the man said.</a>
00:15:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h15m30s">I don’t have much, much money but I’ll
give you everything I have.</a>
00:15:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h15m35s">And the gnome looked displeased.</a>
00:15:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h15m37s">So John added I could pay some more monthly.</a>
00:15:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h15m41s">So the gnome accepted, fair enough buy now
pay later, sounds good for me, I'm all for</a>
00:15:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h15m46s">the installment plan.</a>
00:15:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h15m49s">So the man gave the gnome all his money and
promised to pay the rest later and the gnome</a>
00:15:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h15m52s">walked back into the bush by the road clacking
his teeth and giggling and twitching.</a>
00:15:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h15m57s">The more the man thought about this ruby and
the great deal he got the happier he became,</a>
00:15:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h16m02s">he started back on the road with a light heart
but soon discovered that he couldn't make</a>
00:16:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h16m06s">much progress because 100 pounds was a lot
to carry.</a>
00:16:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h16m10s">He said to himself why continue anyways I
have what I want, I’ll just stand here holding</a>
00:16:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h16m15s">my ruby and when people walk by they could
see how well I've all ready done.</a>
00:16:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h16m20s">So he stopped.</a>
00:16:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h16m22s">A little while one of his little while later
one of his friends came along saw him standing</a>
00:16:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h16m25s">there.</a>
00:16:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h16m26s">His friend said John why don’t you come
along with me.</a>
00:16:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h16m30s">I've just opened a new business and I could
really use some help, come along quick.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h16m34s">It will be opening soon.</a>
00:16:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h16m37s">John thought that sounded good.</a>
00:16:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h16m38s">But his friend was in a hurry.</a>
00:16:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h16m40s">Besides couldn't he see the ruby?</a>
00:16:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h16m42s">How could he speed along beside him where
would he put his jewel.</a>
00:16:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h16m47s">So he said thanks but I have to take care
of my jewel.</a>
00:16:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h16m49s">Maybe I’ll see you later.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h16m51s">His friend looked at him like he was crazy
but he was trying to get somewhere quick so</a>
00:16:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h16m55s">he just shrugged a bit and said okay John

00:16:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h16m59s">And he sped on down the road.</a>
00:16:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h17m01s">Little while later another friend came by
and he said John nice to see you.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h17m04s">I'm going back to school.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h17m05s">There are lots of wonderful things to learn,
great things to do.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h17m09s">The world is full of unsolved problems.</a>
00:17:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h17m11s">I could use some company.</a>
00:17:11</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h17m15s">John thought that sounded pretty good but
this friend too looked like he was in a hurry.</a>
00:17:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h17m19s">Besides standing beside the road holding the
jewel was tiring and he needed all the energy</a>
00:17:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h17m23s">he had for that.</a>
00:17:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h17m24s">So he said to his friend thanks but I have

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h17m42s">Many friends came and went and the years went
by.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h17m44s">The jewel got heavier and heavier.</a>
00:17:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h17m47s">But the man got more and more attached to
it.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h17m49s">The only thing was nobody seemed to notice

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h17m53s">People would rush by and talk about their
plans and nobody had a ruby as big and nobody</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h17m57s">seemed likely to get a ruby as big if you'd
think that someone might have said something</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h18m09s">Then one day someone new came down the road,
he was bent over and he was thin and his hair</a>

up at John, then he grinned and said, why</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9bxcm7hVLU#t=00h18m26s">are you standing there so stupidly with a
