<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h00m23s">Jonathan is an extremely interesting researcher. I've been following his work on disgust and political belief for</a>
00:00:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h00m29s">Literally for decades he was one of the first people who</a>
00:00:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h00m32s">started to do serious research on disgust which is its own emotional system and therefore very much worth attending to</a>
00:00:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h00m38s">But we also have some other</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h00m41s">interests in common Jonathan also</a>
00:00:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h00m43s">Started this institute called the Heterodox Academy</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h00m53s">University faculty and and campuses and discussions, so I first met Jonathan</a>

00:01:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h01m10s">You came to do a job talk at Harvard to for an assistant professorship position</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h01m14s">and I had been aware of your work on disgust then and and</a>
00:01:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h01m18s">Agitated hard for them to hire you because I thought it was of great significance</a>
00:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h01m21s">Which turned out to be exactly the case, so what do you remember about that?</a>
00:01:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h01m26s">I Remember I was so excited to have an interview at Harvard. It was my only interview. If I didn't get that job</a>
00:01:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h01m31s">I had no job for the following year, and it was a very strange day in which I didn't feel particularly</a>
00:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h01m38s">Welcomed or wanted, and then I had my session with you in which it was this guy who was it he had it</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h01m45s">He actually got a job at Harvard, and he was studying Jung which is like almost taboo</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h01m50s">And he was talking about dreams and creativity</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h01m52s">And so I just that was the really bright that was the bright memory of the day was our hour-long conversation</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h01m59s">Yeah, well I was also really interested at the time man now in in the biological basis of behavior right and so and and in</a>
00:01:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h02m07s">in the relationship between fundamental motivational systems and thought because</a>
00:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h02m12s">Obviously our thought is grounded in fundamental motivational systems and your work on disgust</a>
00:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h02m17s">Which maybe you can tell the viewers a little bit about was really interesting to me because it was an emotional system that</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h02m23s">Hadn't been studied much. I mean you were really one of the pioneers in the in the psychological study of disgust</a>
00:02:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h02m28s">Well the way to explain it is that Paul Rozin, my advisor at Penn is</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h02m32s">The pioneer in the study of disgust, and he'd studied it as a food-related emotion</a>
00:02:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h02m36s">he'd written a bit about it being a moral emotion and I was a graduate student at Penn and</a>
00:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h02m41s">I was interested in morality, and I was reading the Bible and I was reading</a>
00:02:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h02m48s">anthropological accounts of different countries and different cultures and at the time morality was all about</a>
00:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h02m54s">Reasoning, about harm, rights and justice so Lawrence Kohlberg was the leading figure in the field and because I was looking at morality across cultures</a>
00:02:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h03m02s">And when you look across cultures</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h03m04s">It's not just about fairness and harm and rights, it's about menstruation and food taboos and skin lesions</a>
00:03:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h03m11s">And it's very physical, and I was you know why why do so many</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h03m16s">Societies why is it like the normal default way of being is to somehow bring the body into morality?</a>
00:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h03m21s">Why is that and so I just happened to be at Penn where the world's expert in</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h03m25s">disgust was I went to talk to him and that started one of the best collaborations of my life and</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h03m30s">What it led to is is a broadening of the of the moral domain basically, there's a sort of Western</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h03m38s">Secular approach that you see in Western philosophers either morality is about harm and utilitarianism</a>
00:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h03m44s">It's minimize harm, or it's about rights and principles</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h03m48s">Immanuel Kant and</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h03m51s">Much better wy psychologiclly, I think bout morlity is virtue ethics. It's just  lot of stuff</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h03m55s">it's just we have just a lot of stuff that we judge on and</a>
00:03:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h03m58s">This led me eventually to realize that people on the left and people on the right</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h04m03s">Care about different stuff everybody cares about harm and fairness</a>
00:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h04m08s">But the stuff about keeping you know boundaries around the group build a wall protect the group hold the group together</a>
00:04:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h04m15s">hate traitors</a>
00:04:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h04m17s">You know everybody can do that</a>
00:04:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h04m18s">But right wing morality builds on these additional additional foundations of these additional emotions and foundations</a>
00:04:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h04m26s">So that work on disgust that I was just beginning to talk about then when we first met in</a>
00:04:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h04m30s">1994 led eventually to what we now call moral foundations theory and with my-- with about five or six</a>
00:04:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h04m36s">colleagues if you go to yourmorals.org</a>
00:04:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h04m39s">You can take our test you can learn all about it</a>
00:04:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h04m42s">But it led to the perspective that</a>
00:04:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h04m44s">Ultimately was I think the right perspective as the cultural war was heating up and as left and right</a>
00:04:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h04m50s">We're essentially becoming like different countries different cultures</a>
00:04:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h04m54s">So so it's not obvious on</a>
00:04:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h04m57s">first</a>
00:04:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h04m58s">Consideration why disgust would be a moral emotion so you know most of the work</a>
00:04:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h05m03s">That's done. That's outside of the disgust realm</a>
00:05:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h05m06s">I would say is predicated on the assumption that the reason that conservatives in particular</a>
00:05:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h05m11s">But perhaps people who are more authoritarian in general draw boundaries around their territories</a>
00:05:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h05m17s">Because they're afraid of the other</a>
00:05:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h05m18s">But that isn't really that isn't really how it plays out as far as I can tell because conservatives for example are less neurotic than</a>
00:05:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h05m25s">Trait in the big five traits sense than liberals although. It's um</a>
00:05:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h05m28s">It's a minor difference</a>
00:05:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h05m29s">But the disgust issue seems to be particularly relevant, so so can you tell us a little bit about why disgust per se?</a>
00:05:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h05m37s">Well first conservatives are a little less neurotic</a>
00:05:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h05m40s">But they also at if you do very low level perceptual experiment just like a puff of white noise in the ear</a>
00:05:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h05m46s">People who react more strongly to that to any sort of very low level threat are more likely to vote Republican in this country</a>
00:05:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h05m53s">So they're you know there are all these interesting personality differences that lead to different politics, but as for why disgust?</a>
00:05:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h05m59s">So I'm I'm a Durkheimian. I would say I love the</a>
00:05:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h06m05s">Sociologist Émile Durkheim, and I'm also a social psychologist</a>
00:06:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h06m08s">So I'm always thinking not about people as individual utility maximizers</a>
00:06:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h06m13s">But people as members of social groups people who are totally focused on</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h06m18s">Belonging in their social groups and people who have some pro-social motives about keeping the group together</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h06m24s">About doing things that are good for the group, so as I try to argue in my book The Righteous Mind. Yes</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h08m04s">That's pretty standard neurology, but the the columns are already pre-wired, so it's actually columns that fire together that wire together</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h09m42s">The definition that I use comes from Gary Marcus who was actually a neuroscientist here at NYU</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h17m02s">They're moving at you know synchronous movement and call and response so it it's using a lot of tropes from religion and religious worship</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h17m19s">Then you hear a couple people screaming out "off campus, off campus"</a>
00:17:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h17m24s">And he says to another location on campus, and there's like oh no no</a>
00:17:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h17m31s">Because you know look no one had to go to this talk so everyone could have just stayed home</a>
00:17:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h17m36s">And the students did succeed in shutting down the venue, so they could have declared a victory</a>
00:17:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h17m41s">But it's not a full victory unless he is physically off the campus</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h17m46s">We can't have him speaking on campus because that defiles us that pollutes us</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h18m27s">but we've fragmented conscientiousness into orderliness and industriousness with a Big Five aspect scale and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h18m34s">Orderliness is strongly associated with disgust</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h18m39s">Right exactly it does sound a lot like Freud</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h18m42s">but it but it also is in accordance with your observations that conservatives have neater spaces for example, so</a>
00:18:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h18m48s">So now in-- and their meetings start on time-- yes, and yeah exactly right right so</a>
00:18:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h18m53s">So then the the nexus for political beliefs seems to be openness. So that's that exploratory tendency that you talked about</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h19m02s">exploration of ideas and creativity and low</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h19m12s">Relatively uncorrelated then I thought and this is in keeping with your work on disgust is that it's an issue of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h19m36s">so it's borders from the highest resolution level of cognition all the way up to the actual physical borders of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h27m23s">Degrading so an interesting element of disgust is this notion of degradation there are always these vertical metaphors</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h27m35s">and and Hinduism is about preparing your body to approach God and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h27m40s">Purification and so that led me to think well if there's an emotion which is about seeing our lower, base or animal</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h27m47s">Biological nature is there an opposite emotion is there an emotion of that we feel when we see some manifestation or a higher</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h28m29s">When you see these acts of beauty and kindness and gratitude. I thought wow that's exactly it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h28m34s">And so because I've been studying disgust. I then started studying its opposite, which I and some others called moral elevations</a>
00:28:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h28m40s">So there's kind of vertical metaphor of elevation and degradation-- maps onto the body too with regards to-- that's right high, low</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h46m38s">It was sort of online in 2014</a>
00:46:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h46m40s">But it came out for good in the summer 2015 which coincidentally was the same summer that my article came out with Greg Lukianoff</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h46m51s">But our concern was entirely faculty was just the nature of the academic community the research community</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h46m57s">So we got these two things going on summer 2015</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h47m00s">And then that summer I hear from Nick Rosencrantz a law professor who says we have the same problem in law</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h47m07s">Is worse in law well, it's really bad in Canada, in law. Okay, because and as he points out</a>
00:47:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h47m12s">We're training all these students</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h47m30s">This is a big problem for the whole academy-- Have you looked at faculties of Education? Oh my God, those are the worst, by worst</a>
00:47:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h47m36s">I don't know the numbers</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h47m37s">But in terms of the vindictiveness that the incred the pressure put on any non-conforming opinion my impression</a>
00:47:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h47m45s">I don't of data, but my impression from the letters I get is that education schools and social work school</a>
00:47:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h47m50s">Yeah, are the worst that's exactly in keeping with my my understanding as well</a>
00:47:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h47m55s">It's hard to tell which of those two are worst</a>
00:47:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h47m57s">I would say it's the faculties of Education because they have a direct pipeline to kids. Oh, in terms of their effects. Yes far more pernicious</a>
00:47:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h48m04s">Yeah, yes, yeah, but but equally equally warped let's say but but more pernicious</a>
00:48:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h48m08s">And and the things that are happening in the Canadian education system as a consequence of that are so reprehensible it-- We should get to that</a>
00:48:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h48m14s">Because it's happening here too with these ideas filtering down to high school. I've been so focused on college now</a>
00:48:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h48m19s">We're discovering the problem is actually baked in the illiberal attitudes are often baked in</a>
00:48:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h48m24s">Yes, and purposefully like in in Canada increasingly the the radical leftists have control over curriculum development</a>
00:48:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h48m32s">And they're starting to develop social justice curriculums, which is what they call them</a>
00:48:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h48m37s">For kindergarten kids so it's really it's been another get back through the earlier grades</a>
00:48:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h48m42s">So so the originally three of us decided to put up a website</a>
00:48:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h48m46s">I invited all the other authors from the the BBS paper</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h48m49s">We invited a few other people working on this and so for the first year we had this project, it was called heterodoxacademy.org</a>
00:48:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h48m55s">We put the site up on about September 10th. I think it was</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h49m05s">the problem of the lack of viewpoint diversity, well five days later the protests start at Missouri, so these are</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h49m12s">racially motivated protests or protests about racial</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h49m18s">And at first it seemed like this is just a Missouri problem, but coming in the wake of course of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h49m23s">Ferguson and all the videos we saw of unarmed black men being killed by police</a>

00:49:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h49m33s">But it was that fall of 2015 especially the Yale protest</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h49m45s">This is not just a faculty issue anymore so even though at Heterodox Academy we mostly focus on the faculty</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h57m39s">So I didn't mean to say you can say you know are racist rant</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h57m41s">I mean you can put forth any idea you want if you can back it up what we're seeing</a>
00:57:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h57m46s">with anything politicized is it's not about backing it up students are learning rhetorical techniques to link their enemies to</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h57m54s">Something racist as-- Well something contemptible, something contaminated-- Something disgusting</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h57m58s">You bet and that and that and those are the things that are not only worthy of being destroyed</a>
00:57:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h58m03s">But that you have a moral duty to destroy that's-- Oh, that's right, so it's almost like the immune system</a>
00:58:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h58m07s">Yeah, I don't know exactly how it works</a>
00:58:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h58m08s">but there's some cell that tags a cell as</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h58m12s">You know enemy enemy and once that tag is put on the cell that attracts other I don't know</a>
00:58:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h58m17s">What kind of cell to it-- Yeah, mob it so we should look into this this metaphor of the immune system</a>
00:58:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h58m21s">Yeah, because you know once they once you're labeled as a racist</a>
00:58:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h58m25s">Students don't have to read you that it doesn't matter what you actually say you will now be attacked. Well</a>
00:58:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h58m29s">It's also too that once you're labeled that way if someone defends you the label is contagious, right?</a>
00:58:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h58m37s">In exactly the same manner-- That's how we know we're in this super-religious territory of witch-hunts that if you stand up for someone you are tagged and then you</a>
00:58:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h58m44s">will be mobbed. Right and that's an infectious disease</a>
00:58:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h58m47s">Exactly, That's why there's so much cowardice on campus among both students and faculty</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h58m57s">Unfair they're afraid to stand up and that's in part due to social media because it's just I mean students today have been raised with</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h59m17s">The students had to get together somehow and decide</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h59m26s">So to what degree, so let's talk about the aims of the Heterodox Academy, so you've brought people together who are in</a>
00:59:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h59m33s">principle interested in a</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h59m35s">Diversity of opinions and but but in what manner is that going to be utilized to - - I</a>
00:59:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h59m42s">don't want to use the word combat but - but to deal with this emergent problem of ideological rigidity in the universities? Yeah, so</a>
00:59:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h59m49s">Two useful concepts here one is The Emperor's New Clothes</a>
00:59:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h59m52s">We all know that story</a>
00:59:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h59m54s">Even if most people even if everybody sees this is nuts the Emperor's walking around with no clothes</a>
00:59:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=00h59m59s">They're afraid to say it until one person says it so and this is also the Asch experiment</a>
00:59:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h00m04s">Everybody says that that line is the same as that line. It's obviously not true</a>
01:00:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h00m07s">If one person says the truth then nobody conforms after that</a>
01:00:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h00m12s">So the mere presence of a group of people who say you know</a>
01:00:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h00m16s">But we actually need a diversity of opinions and the fact that on our site</a>
01:00:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h00m19s">We'll publish things so sometimes when professors are mobbed like when Bret Weinstein</a>
01:00:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h00m23s">You know was mobbed you know so I wrote an essay that stood up for him. We've done it for some of them</a>
01:00:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h00m27s">It's happening so fast. I can't keep up. I can't I've got books to write like you know every week</a>
01:00:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h00m31s">There's some new members getting mobbed and so we're gonna develop a team of people who will write</a>
01:00:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h00m36s">But just knowing that there are people who will stand up for you</a>
01:00:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h00m39s">Knowing that there are people who will say wait a second</a>
01:00:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h00m42s">You know this is not what we do in the Academy</a>
01:00:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h00m44s">So that's one thing is we just stand up for each other. Um two is we develop products that</a>
01:00:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h00m50s">We think can basically fix the situation</a>
01:00:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h00m53s">So one of our products is called the campus expression survey</a>
01:00:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h00m57s">It's a survey designed to actually measure who was afraid of speaking up about what topics and why what are they afraid of?</a>
01:00:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h01m04s">And it turns out everyone's afraid of the students more than the faculty</a>
01:01:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h01m08s">They're afraid to mostly to talk about race-- What about the administrators? Everyone's afraid of the students. They're afraid of the students.</a>
01:01:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h01m13s">Oh, so I don't have we've not so made them. I've only surveyed students. I don't okay, okay, but from what we hear</a>
01:01:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h01m20s">People are afraid of of the students</a>
01:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h01m25s">That's also appalling in its own manner like was that Reed where-- It's a failure of leadership, yeah-- that's for sure</a>
01:01:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h01m31s">They let those kids come into the classroom the actual classroom and disrupt a class on an ongoing basis. I mean-- For months--</a>
01:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h01m38s">Yes, and I couldn't understand that exactly I mean my response to that would be</a>
01:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h01m44s">First I would tell them to leave second I would call campus security</a>
01:01:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h01m48s">Third if something wasn't done about it</a>
01:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h01m49s">I just wouldn't teach the class</a>
01:01:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h01m51s">So I don't understand like it seems to me that it's also up to individual professors to draw a line</a>
01:01:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h01m56s">Which is that if you're being intimidated by students, why do you why do you show up and teach the class?</a>
01:01:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h02m02s">I don't understand that-- Yeah, so um again</a>
01:02:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h02m05s">People are afraid to stand up if it means that people will call you a racist</a>
01:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h02m10s">Yeah, but God. I mean it's it's weird in that situation though-- It's carried to an absurd--</a>
01:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h02m13s">You're also afraid to go to your class you know and there's a much more proximal threat there</a>
01:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h02m19s">That's what I mean. That's what I'm most alarmed by is the rise of intimidation intimidation is now a</a>
01:02:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h02m24s">In many aspects of academic life, and that's just terrible that's completely incompatible</a>
01:02:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h02m28s">With what we do and who we are. What's especially it's especially appalling given that whatever happens in the university campuses</a>
01:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h02m35s">You know like one of the questions I've faced in Canada is well, why should we care about what's happening</a>
01:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h02m41s">Yeah-- In the ivory tower? If you're gonna hire these people next year. You are well. Yeah well</a>
01:02:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h02m45s">They're it's the heart like what's happening in the campuses is going to happen in society in five years</a>
01:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h02m50s">It's already that goes it's already happens. This is actually important point</a>
01:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h02m52s">I just gave a talk at a big law firm here in New York where they're very devoted to diversity, but they're doing it</a>
01:02:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h02m59s">Right they're really thinking about diverse like why is diversity good, and spent a whole month on viewpoint diversity</a>
01:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h03m03s">which is just fantastic and</a>
01:03:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h03m05s">What I'm learning from talking to a number of people in the business world is</a>
01:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h03m09s">That in the last year there are now all these pressures on leaders to endorse this condemn that sign this open letter</a>
01:03:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h03m19s">That's right, that's right, but it's the same dynamic. We have on campus and the answer to it</a>
01:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h03m24s">So if anybody anybody watching here if you run a business if you have friends who are in business</a>
01:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h03m28s">I think the only the there are only two stable equilibria</a>
01:03:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h03m32s">One is that every organization is just either all right wing we're all left-wing</a>
01:03:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h03m36s">But that would be disastrous you so either you just say okay, we're on one side, but that would be terrible</a>
01:03:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h03m41s">The other is what we call the Chicago principles of free expression</a>
01:03:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h03m44s">The University of Chicago has the best statement out there on how the University provides a platform on which</a>
01:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h03m51s">Multiple views can contest the university does not take any one side</a>
01:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h03m55s">That's the only other stable alternative, and I think leaders need to do this in business, certainly in universities</a>
01:03:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h04m01s">So we're encouraging every University to adopt the Chicago principles because a lot of what mass action is is an attempt to</a>
01:04:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h04m08s">Compel the authority to come in on your side and punish your enemies. Yeah</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h04m12s">And so that has to stop-- So so how how effectively is the Chicago statement on on</a>
01:04:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h04m19s">How effectively is the Chicago statement being disseminated how rapidly are universities signing up or or?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h04m25s">They're, a few signed on early in this whole crisis</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h12m12s">My article came out with Lukianoff on The Coddling the American Mind, the BBS article was published</a>
01:12:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h12m18s">And I thought ok now I can get back to this you know keep read this capitalism book</a>
01:12:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h12m21s">And then the university is kind of began melting down in the fall, and then we started Heterodox Academy</a>
01:12:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h12m26s">And so yes it has taken over my life. It's it's basically a full-time job in addition to trying to write</a>
01:12:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h12m32s">the I'm also working on a book so</a>
01:12:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h12m34s">Lukianoff</a>
01:12:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h12m35s">And I didn't want to turn our article into a book because we thought we'd said everything but man have things been happening fast</a>
01:12:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h12m41s">We've learned so much more since we wrote that article. And you wrote that article when? How long-- Well we wrote it in late 2014</a>
01:12:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h12m47s">And then we you know edited it in early 2015 and it finally came out in August of 2015</a>
01:12:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h12m52s">And so in last October Greg wrote to me and said John</a>
01:12:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h12m56s">I think I do want to turn the article into a book because we know so much more now</a>
01:12:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h13m00s">And it's the problem is so much more serious</a>
01:13:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h13m02s">Than it was then and the evidence, my God, the evidence about mental the mental health crisis of adolescents when Greg and I wrote the article</a>
01:13:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h13m09s">We were you know we saw lots of hints that depression and anxiety were going way up-- Yeah--</a>
01:13:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h13m14s">And we think that's related to the overprotection</a>
01:13:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h13m17s">Yeah ok so let's talk about that just for a sec and then go back to the book</a>
01:13:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h13m21s">So I've got a potential demographic explanation for that in part well</a>
01:13:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h13m25s">And I don't know if you guys have looked into this or not well</a>
01:13:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h13m28s">There's there's two things that I think might be contributing to it</a>
01:13:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h13m33s">One is two or three things one is the average age at which children are</a>
01:13:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h13m40s">The average age at which people have children has gone way up</a>
01:13:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h13m43s">Why does that matter? Well because I think people get more conservative and cautious as they get older. A little bit, true</a>
01:13:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h13m49s">But it's a very small effect okay, and it's wait a second, okay</a>
01:13:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h13m52s">It's the having of the kids, which is what makes them more conservative when you have kids you are more threat sensitive</a>
01:13:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h13m58s">You're more likely to vote for the right-wing party so</a>
01:13:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h14m00s">Just delaying child child</a>
01:14:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h14m03s">Birth wouldn't okay. What about what about fewer siblings?</a>
01:14:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h14m06s">That would yes that's part of it, and this is what we're seeing in Asia too when you have a lot of kids</a>
01:14:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h14m12s">You're not quite as worried. You don't have all your eggs in one basket. Well</a>
01:14:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h14m16s">And you can't be quite as worried and the siblings raise each other-- that's right-- right and then there's a lot of dominance hierarchies</a>
01:14:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h14m21s">struggle. That's right, exactly-- They play and fight</a>
01:14:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h14m23s">It's the free play and the fighting the working things out for themselves those are essential skills of adulthood</a>
01:14:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h14m28s">Okay, so good, so then all right</a>
01:14:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h14m30s">Yeah, let me only size is part of it right well, and then also what's happening increasingly in schools</a>
01:14:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h14m35s">Is that kids aren't allowed free play, and they're certainly not allowed</a>
01:14:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h14m40s">Rough-and-tumble free play. Exactly that's right. That's one of the biggest things as well so the two that there are three giant</a>
01:14:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h14m46s">There are a lot of problems</a>
01:14:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h14m47s">I mean this is such actually it's really a fun puzzle because it's like the biggest social science puzzle of our age. What is happening</a>
01:14:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h14m54s">That's making so many of our systems go haywire, and I'm focusing on the university the big three</a>
01:14:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h14m58s">I would say our one is the loss of free of unsupervised free play. Yeah, okay, and Peter Gray has been brilliant on this</a>
01:14:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h15m05s">He's at Boston College showing how even among young animals they have to practice the skills for adulthood</a>
01:15:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h15m10s">Yeah
And getting in conflicts and then dealing with it and sometimes losing and will come back</a>
01:15:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h15m19s">Having a game in which there's a problem, but you have to work it out or the game stops</a>
01:15:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h15m23s">That's what kids always did. Yeah.</a>
01:15:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h15m24s">It's only recently the 90s in the 90s that they're always supervised because we're afraid if we take our eyes off them</a>
01:15:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h15m30s">The moderate left puts its best foot forward, arguing traditional liberal values of the university, explaining how extreme leftism on campus is a deep threat to the identity of the University at virtually all levels.</a>
01:15:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h15m30s">They'll be kidnapped, and it was never a risk was never you know</a>
01:15:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h15m33s">I've kind of wondered about this gender flexibility issue as form of delayed fantasy play</a>
01:15:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h15m39s">You're getting Freudian on me, go ahead. Well because because it looks to me like that is you know when kids are little and three</a>
01:15:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h15m45s">And four say three to seven they do a tremendous amount of identity play you know they pretend they're animals they pretend</a>
01:15:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h15m51s">They're their parents they</a>
01:15:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h15m53s">They pretend they're girls if they're boys they pretend they're boys</a>
01:15:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h15m56s">If they're girls like they really do a tremendous amount of identity play and one of the things that's been really</a>
01:15:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h16m01s">Puzzling me is well. What happens if that isn't</a>
01:16:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h16m05s">If they never have an opportunity for that because they're not engaging in fantasy play, maybe it's just delayed till adulthood</a>
01:16:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h16m11s">So because played it's almost impossible to overstate the importance of that rough-and-tumble play</a>
01:16:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h16m17s">And then the fantasy play that enables you to adopt different identities</a>
01:16:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h16m21s">And then the negotiated games that you talked about that enabled people to handle both both victory, but even more importantly loss</a>
01:16:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h16m29s">That's possible that could well be I that I have no opinion on you know, but the big three factors that I think are</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h16m35s">Explaining to explain what's happening on campus are one the loss of the unsupervised play so that the kids</a>
01:16:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h16m41s">have always there's always an adult present and so they come to college and they expect there to be an adult and Dean somebody if</a>
01:16:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h16m46s">There's a conflict that's one</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h16m48s">Two is social media, which hit just as iGen, so iGen, internet generation. This is Jene Twenge's work</a>
01:16:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h16m55s">You know we used to we used to think that</a>
01:16:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h16m58s">We used to think that the millennial generation ends in</a>

01:17:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h17m10s">Kids born in 1995 and after are really different, their values are different</a>
01:17:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h17m14s">They have much higher rates of anxiety and depression especially the girls boys have gone up, girls have gone way up</a>
01:17:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h17m22s">And the reason seems to be that Facebook lowered its age</a>
01:17:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h17m27s">So in 2005 you had to be a college student at a certain number of colleges to get Facebook</a>
01:17:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h17m34s">In 2006 you could be any eleven-year-old who lies and says that she's 13 and you've got a Facebook account</a>
01:17:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h17m41s">But then you're using it on your parents, PC and in 2007 the iPhone comes out</a>
01:17:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h17m47s">And it saturates the market faster than any consumer product ever has</a>
01:17:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h17m50s">so by 2010 or 11</a>
01:17:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h17m52s">A lot of adolescents have have Facebook and other social platforms</a>
01:17:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h17m57s">And this is just devastating especially to girls because it's not texting texting is just me to you</a>
01:17:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h18m03s">You know that's back and forth that's fine that you know we, when we were kids we called our friends on the phone</a>
01:18:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h18m07s">That's fine the problem seems to be according to Twenge. It's especially</a>
01:18:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h18m12s">Platforms in which he put something out, and then you wait and see what everyone says it right and that</a>
01:18:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h18m17s">Especially is damaging to girls who already are at risk of eating disorders and image issues. Okay, okay</a>
01:18:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h18m22s">So so girls become more susceptible to negative emotion when they hit puberty. Well, well they're-- Yes-- Yes, ok</a>
01:18:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h18m28s">then there's another issue too with regards to female aggression so</a>
01:18:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h18m32s">You know it's clearly the case that males are more likely to be physically</a>
01:18:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h18m38s">Damaging slash aggressive than females are but what females use is reputation savaging</a>
01:18:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h18m43s">That's Nicki Crick's work, Nikki Crick passed away a couple years ago</a>
01:18:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h18m46s">Showed that if you add it all up boys and girls are equally aggressive</a>
01:18:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h18m50s">But the boys aggression is more physical the girls the more relational so if you imagine a bunch of 13, 14 year-olds in</a>
01:18:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h18m56s">their middle schools, and then you parachute in a whole bunch of iPhones</a>
01:18:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h19m01s">Everybody's got one in their pocket now. What are the boys gonna? Do they're gonna play video games that doesn't hurt anybody. Yeah</a>
01:19:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h19m06s">But the girls are going to use it to amplify the social interactions, so this is Twenge's explanation</a>
01:19:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h19m12s">I think it makes a lot of sense, so it's a it's a catastrophe. It's a crisis, and we're really hurting especially the girls</a>
01:19:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h19m18s">So we've got to change something about that anyway</a>
01:19:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h19m20s">But social media is is possibly the largest single reason why things are going haywire on campus the third big factor</a>
01:19:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h19m27s">and do you think it's primarily Facebook or can you tell well, it's it's a</a>
01:19:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h19m31s">The kids use a lot of different platforms, but from what I hear Instagram</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h19m38s">Again the thing is it's one too many</a>
01:19:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h19m39s">That's what's bad is anything if it's if it's you put something out there, and you see how many people liked it, right</a>
01:19:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h19m46s">That's what's right, and there's always the threat that it'll go viral in a terrible way so that's a hammer exactly</a>
01:19:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h19m51s">Or the Sword of Damocles</a>
01:19:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h19m53s">That's like unlimited damage. Unlimited downside to saying something. So what do you do, so they're very careful. Right.</a>
01:19:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h19m58s">So I don't know if I want to like that post because you know I could get in big trouble for it. Right</a>
01:19:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h20m03s">Well the benefit to liking it is minimal and the potential catastrophe</a>
01:20:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h20m06s">Unless you're expected to like it in which case you better like it because you if you don't like it</a>
01:20:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h20m10s">You'll get in trouble, so it's a much more of a mob</a>
01:20:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h20m13s">Mentality kids are afraid. You know I'm not blaming the kids. I'm very sympathetic to me. These are my kids</a>
01:20:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h20m17s">You know my kids are 11, and 7. They're gonna come up into this</a>
01:20:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h20m21s">So the kids have been raised in a in a social environment</a>
01:20:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h20m24s">That's much more about mob mob formation and mob attacks and mob defend defenses against mobs</a>
01:20:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h20m30s">And then the so the third factor, then is the political polarization and the purification of institutions</a>
01:20:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h20m36s">So if you imagine coming up in the 90s when political polarization is going up</a>
01:20:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h20m40s">We're beginning to hate each other more across party lines, but it's not that hard not that that nasty</a>
01:20:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h20m46s">But it's been getting much much more hostile so that now if someone like if someone is if someone goes to a campus</a>
01:20:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h20m52s">Republicans meeting if it's a democrat who goes to a meeting of the campus republicans has happened at UC Santa Cruz a couple weeks ago</a>
01:20:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h21m00s">and someone finds out you know that so the the</a>
01:21:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h21m04s">hatred the cross party hatred is so much stronger now and</a>
01:21:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h21m08s">Many of our institutions are much purer, so if you went to college the 90s there might have been a few conservative professors around</a>
01:21:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h21m15s">But now there aren't so as you said before it's like exposure therapy if you've never</a>
01:21:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h21m19s">Encountered a conservative idea and then a conservative like Heather McDonald comes to speak on your campus well</a>
01:21:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h21m24s">This is like a major immune response problem. We got to get the tribe together and mob her and you know shut her down</a>
01:21:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h21m31s">So those are the I mean they're many other reasons, but the loss of unsupervised play social media and rise of polarization</a>
01:21:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h21m38s">Those are the three big ones. Right, well, those are big problems especially the loss of unsupervised play</a>
01:21:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h21m43s">It's not it's not obvious at all how that might be addressed. Yes, it is! Okay, Good good. I everyone should buy</a>
01:21:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h21m49s">Everyone should just buy Lenore Skenazy's book Free-Range Kids</a>
01:21:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h21m53s">And then they should loosen up and give their kids more unsupervised time now. You can't do this alone. You'll be arrested</a>
01:21:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h22m00s">Yeah</a>
01:22:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h22m01s">I tried to get my son to go out across the street to you know buy groceries when he was you know nine years</a>
01:22:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h22m06s">Old yeah, and he'd say like, but you know daddy people look at me funny. There are no other kids out there</a>
01:22:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h22m11s">And so Lenore has started a fantastic organization called Let Grow so if viewers go to letgrow.org</a>
01:22:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h22m20s">Okay, we'll put all this in the description all of these things</a>
01:22:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h22m22s">So I'm on the board of it as an adviser Peter Gray an expert on play is on the board and they're doing these</a>
01:22:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h22m28s">simple things</a>
01:22:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h22m30s">Simple  like you convince a school to just open up the playground an hour early</a>
01:22:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h22m37s">Or keep it open after school</a>
01:22:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h22m39s">Why should kids always have organized activities and soccer practice?</a>
01:22:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h22m43s">Just give them a place to play where there's a nurse available if someone gets hurt</a>
01:22:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h22m47s">There is an adult, but he's not supervising. He's just over there right so don't worry parents</a>
01:22:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h22m53s">There is an adult, but beyond that is what they want and they just started this a few weeks ago, and the results are fantastic</a>
01:22:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h22m59s">The kids are having so much fun. They are becoming more independent. They're more willing to do projects on their own</a>
01:22:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h23m05s">It's working out great. So oh, that's really can't do this on your own, but the thing is</a>
01:23:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h23m11s">So those are very practical that's very practical piece of advice for schools. It's like open up the unsupervised play</a>
01:23:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h23m19s">Facilities and and and facilitate their use. That's right. Give give everyone a place which is safe and by safe</a>
01:23:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h23m25s">I mean physically safe right never use the word safety to describe emotions and ideas safety means physical safety</a>
01:23:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h23m32s">So you've got to provide a physically safe place for the kids to play and beyond that you let him go now there will arise</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h23m39s">Problems of bullying so if it's repeated harassment, oh, you know well</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h24m06s">I don't know what the origins of it are</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h24m14s">Yeah, well like so this are much smaller-- in the U.S?-- In the U.S.</a>
01:24:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h24m17s">Yeah, the question is whether or not they were able to implement them with the rigor he did, in the U.S.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h24m22s">Yeah, but bullying programs are part of the problem because bullying clearly is a problem</a>
01:24:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h24m27s">We need to do something about it, but because we have what's called concept creep</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h24m30s">Yes, oh so, it's now my joint concept creep looks like even yeah, that's right</a>
01:24:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h24m36s">So now it's the case that if if kids don't invite if some kids want to do something</a>
01:24:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h24m42s">And they don't invite another kid they've excluded that kid right. Well. That could be bullying right?</a>
01:24:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h24m47s">I've read of schools in Europe that don't allow kids to have best friends for exactly that reason</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h24m52s">Yeah</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h24m52s">Well because the this is also something that really bothers me about the misuse of the IAT [Implicit Association Test]</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h25m22s">Yeah, I think both of us have spent a lot of time looking at ancient wisdom at the writings of</a>
01:25:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h25m27s">People long ago, and I often come back to Aristotle's claim that any virtue carried to extremes becomes a vice</a>
01:25:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h25m35s">so inclusion is a good thing if people are being excluded because they have a physical stigma or</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h25m53s">Inclusion over everything else and so if those two best friends are excluding others. No more best friend. All right. This is madness</a>
01:25:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h26m00s">Yeah, this is a vice so I think that inclusion again. You know it's a virtue unless it's carried to extremes</a>
01:26:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h26m08s">Well, that's probably a pretty good place to stop</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h29m11s">What about the disciplines on campus that seem to be primarily devoted to the activist cause?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h29m17s">Like because my view is or my fear is that we've subsidized the activist disciplines</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h30m02s">That's not a good idea because it opens up the door to political interference in the Academy and that's bad. That's</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h31m08s">And I think we need that concept in the Academy we have I'm not sure if recall fiduciary duties or just professional duties</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h31m15s">But I think we have two primary professional duties that we must never never betray</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h31m20s">One the most important one in our role as scholars is our duty to the truth</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h31m37s">political ideological commitments clearly warp us they make us do things they make they push us so</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h31m44s">We've got a whole we've got to recognize that if we let our systems get out of whack we are betraying the truth</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h31m54s">We are systemically betraying the truth in many of our disciplines</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h31m56s">So I think we need an awareness of that and we need to hold herself to a higher standard</a>
01:31:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h32m00s">Then in our role as teachers we have and here we really can call it a fiduciary duty</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h32m05s">These are people's children who are sent to us to educate to enlarge their minds to teach them skills</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h32m35s">Right, but the the response to that especially from the postmodernist types is that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h32m44s">so back to your original question are there problem departments absolutely so I wanted to put forth these two commitments to truth and</a>
01:32:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h32m52s">to educating not indoctrinating yeah, and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h32m55s">Universities that embrace these highest goals like the University of Chicago. I think is the best candidate</a>
01:32:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h33m01s">will probably find that they need to</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h33m09s">Other universities, and I think Brown is leading the way on this one so far</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h33m13s">I mean the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h33m14s">Early 2015 the president had all kinds of statements about Brown is committed to social justice a fundamental bedrock commitment to social justice she said</a>
01:33:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h33m22s">so if some universities choose to devote themselves to social justice</a>
01:33:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h33m26s">That's fine. Just be upfront about it say so so students will know if you want social justice training you go to Brown</a>
01:33:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h33m33s">but if you want to actually be trained to find the truth to do research you go to Chicago and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h33m44s">What I'm hoping so that's the mechanism there if they if they make it if they make their statements public</a>
01:33:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h33m49s">That the choice of the students will be</a>
01:33:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h33m51s">To go to the universities that hold the principles that you just described over the other one so it'll be a marketplace choice exactly</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h33m58s">That's right, so that's why I said when I talk about the Emperor's New Clothes</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IBegL_V6AA#t=01h34m10s">So my prediction is that Chicago is going to see a huge surge of applications this year,  if that's true</a>
