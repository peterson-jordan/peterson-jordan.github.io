					<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h00m00s">Student: Hello. Peterson Doctor. Mother . my question is</a>
00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h00m04s">I know you mentioned in the last uh lecture that the importance of setting goals in life</a>
00:00:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h00m11s">Peterson: Yes</a>
00:00:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h00m11s">Student: And um, to some kind of goals to work towards, right?</a>
00:00:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h00m16s">So my question was: How do you do that, if you don't know where to go?</a>
00:00:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h00m22s">Because, that's kind of where you got stuck in your future authoring program, because ...</a>
00:00:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h00m27s">Doctor: Well, that's a good question, that's a really good question. Mother ...</a>
00:00:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h00m34s">To some degree, I think it echoes the structure of biblical stories, in this way.</a>
00:00:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h00m40s">So this idea in the Old Testament is that morality follows a series of prohibitions.</a>
00:00:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h00m47s">There is a bunch of bad things you shouldn't do, then basically good.</a>
00:00:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h00m51s">And I think there's a wisdom in that, I think that kind of kid starts, right? You are-</a>
00:00:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h00m56s">I mean, I love kids and all that, but they're crazy little creatures, and they should be, united.</a>
00:00:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h01m03s">Well what you do is put a ban on them.</a>
00:01:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h01m06s">Mostly what you are trying to do is prohibit them.</a>
00:01:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h01m11s">For behaviors that, if manifested, will make their lives miserable.</a>
00:01:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h01m15s">So, I have another chapter in this book that I'm writing, called "Don't let your kids do anything that makes you hate them."</a>
00:01:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h01m21s">And the idea there is, your job as a parent is ...</a>
00:01:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h01m25s">Help your kids become a class of 4-year-olds so that adults smile sincerely, as they enter a room.</a>
00:01:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h01m32s">Because that makes the entire social environment sincere and welcoming.</a>
00:01:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h01m36s">Thus, your job is to make them social desirable beings. And a lot of that is the ban.</a>
00:01:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h01m42s">Well, there is this moral shift.</a>
00:01:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h01m45s">It occurs, to some extent, in a tradition - in the prophetic tradition,</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h01m50s">Where there is a soul that seems, in some sense, higher than the law.</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h01m54s">But there is a real shift between the Old Testament and the New Testament,</a>
00:01:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h01m57s">Because the Old Testament is forbidden, and the New Testament is ...</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h02m00s">“Well, here are the good things that you do, one of which is more than just blocking yourself from…” of impulsive sin, let's say.</a>
00:02:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h02m09s">There are good positives to be, ah, accomplished.</a>
00:02:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h02m12s">Well, you might say, "Well, I don't know what a positive good is!"</a>
00:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h02m14s">Fair enough, man!</a>
00:02:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h02m16s">So ... for this reason, this thing that I told people, became this meme by the crazy internet,</a>
00:02:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h02m21s">But that's to clean your room and ... [crowd laughs]</a>
00:02:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h02m25s">And it is much more useful than people think! It's a lot harder too, but ...</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h02m28s">The first thing you do, I think,</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h02m30s">And I learned this partly from Solzhenitsyn, he was trying to level his soul, when he was in the gulag,</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h02m35s">Because he was trying to figure out how he got there.</a>
00:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h02m37s">How it contributed, and how did it get there.</a>
00:02:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h02m39s">You know, not Stalin and Hitler, although they were to blame, you know, but ...</a>
00:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h02m43s">He couldn't do much about it.</a>
00:02:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h02m45s">I guess what you have to do, that's part of humility,</a>
00:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h02m48s">Should you look around, within your sphere of influence,</a>
00:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h02m51s">For example, the field of direct influence, fixing things that declare themselves in need of repair.</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h02m59s">These are often small things.</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h03m01s">You know, and it could be, like ... your room. Put it in order!</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h03m05s">Because the thing is, it's not very important that your room is tidy, even though it is.</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h03m10s">What is important is that you learn how to distinguish between chaos and order.</a>
00:03:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h03m15s">And to be able to act in a way that produces order.</a>
00:03:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h03m18s">And in most homes, there are 100 things that can be done.</a>
00:03:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h03m21s">Let's make it less ugly and awful.</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h03m24s">Thus, practicing this is a truly beneficial form of meditation.</a>
00:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h03m28s">It's also - it's also ... I think it's a divine act, because you take mess!</a>
00:03:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h03m33s">And you know, if you pay attention to a room, it's super exciting.</a>
00:03:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h03m37s">And I learned - because I've restored so many places now, try to make them beautiful.</a>
00:03:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h03m40s">And one of the things I really learned is that even if you have a physique,</a>
00:03:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h03m45s">Unless you investigate all the nooks and crannies, clean them up and put your fingerprint on them,</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h03m51s">And you made it yours - it's not yours.</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h03m54s">Just the fact of physical ownership doesn't make it yours!</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h03m57s">You have to create a dynamic relationship with objects, before they actually belong to you.</a>
00:03:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h04m03s">And I think you could do something as simple as just sit on your bed and think:</a>
00:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h04m07s">`` Well, maybe there are 5 things I could do today, so ...</a>
00:04:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h04m11s">Tomorrow morning is a little better than this morning has been, or at least I'm not falling behind. "</a>
00:04:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h04m16s">And usually that ... like he had to eat a frog in the morning, right?</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h04m20s">It's like, it's not going to be something you want to do, there will be things you're trying to avoid.</a>
00:04:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h04m23s">They are snakes, basically.</a>
00:04:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h04m25s">But if you ask yourself, like you ask someone, I think it is a form of prayer,</a>
00:04:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h04m30s">If you asked yourself instead of telling yourself, you know,</a>
00:04:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h04m33s">“What can I do, to set things right today,</a>
00:04:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h04m37s">Am I actually going? "</a>
00:04:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h04m40s">It's usually a little thing, because you're not disciplined, you know.</a>
00:04:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h04m43s">Then you can go do it!</a>
00:04:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h04m45s">Hence, you ... you put the world together a little bit more,</a>
00:04:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h04m48s">When you do that, and that spreads,</a>
00:04:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h04m51s">But you also put you, you also build yourself into something,</a>
00:04:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h04m55s">This is best able to summon order from chaos.</a>
00:04:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h04m59s">This makes you increasingly more powerful!</a>
00:04:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h05m03s">And the next day, maybe you can do a little bigger task! And the...</a>
00:05:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h05m07s">Like, you get compound interest, if you do this, and it's a hugely powerful technique.</a>
00:05:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h05m12s">And I think if you do, at some point, instead of just fixing things, it's not good;</a>
00:05:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h05m19s">You'll start to get a glimmer of positive things you can do,</a>
00:05:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h05m25s">The positive things you can do that will actually constitute a vision.</a>
00:05:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h05m28s">This is what I would recommend.</a>
00:05:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgugeKaJa8#t=00h05m30s">Student: Thank you.</a>
