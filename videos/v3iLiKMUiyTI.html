<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h00m20s">planning to cover is to do that with
examples they stick better and they're</a>
00:00:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h00m25s">more interesting and it's very difficult
to understand you outside of a narrative</a>
00:00:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h00m30s">context and so I'm going to walk you
through the Lion King today how many of</a>
00:00:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h00m34s">you have seen the Lion King yes
so how many of you haven't right okay so</a>
00:00:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h00m40s">so you obviously were raised in a box
somewhere out in the middle of field so</a>
00:00:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h00m45s">anyways you know it's it's it's an
amazingly popular animated movie I think</a>
00:00:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h00m50s">it was the most highest grossing
animated movie ever made made until</a>
00:00:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h00m54s">frozen which I actually absolutely

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h01m03s">influenced by them so it's a bit of a
cheat I would say in some sense but it</a>
00:01:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h01m07s">doesn't I don't for the purposes that
we're using it for I think it's just</a>
00:01:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h01m10s">fine and so partly what you might think
about is that it's its relationship to</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h01m17s">archetypal themes that made it so
overwhelmingly popular it's same being</a>
00:01:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h01m22s">the case with say books and movies like
Harry Potter or the entire Marvel series</a>
00:01:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h01m27s">the Marvel series is quite interesting I
know somebody who wrote for Batman and</a>
00:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h01m31s">for Wolverine I know Batman he's into
Marvel comic but one of the things that</a>
00:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h01m35s">he told me that was quite interesting
was that once these characters take off</a>
00:01:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h01m38s">and establish a life of their own they
have a backstory and which becomes part</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h01m42s">of the mythology that's collectively
held by the readers and if you you can</a>
00:01:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h01m46s">invent an alternative universe where you
can muck about with the backstory but</a>
00:01:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h01m50s">otherwise you better stick with it or
the readers are gonna write you and tell</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h01m52s">you that you've got the story wrong and
so there's a bit of a collaboration</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h01m56s">between the writers and the readers
after these things take on a life of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h01m59s">their own and so and of course the they
they tend to the the comic books in</a>
00:01:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h02m05s">particular tend to tend towards
mythological themes very very rapidly</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h02m08s">and so anyways Carl Jung was a
fascinating person I think</a>
00:02:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h02m13s">you can read his biography autobiography
/ biography which is called memories</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h02m18s">dreams and reflections which in many
ways I think is an unfortunate book</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h02m21s">because it's usually the only book that
people read that's that is more or less</a>
00:02:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h02m25s">by young but and it is more popular yet
popularly accessible which is probably a</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h02m30s">good thing but it's also it's not as
rigorous as his other books and so the</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h02m37s">problem with someone like Jung is you
kind of have to read him as much as you</a>
00:02:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h02m40s">can in the original because interpreting
him is not a very straightforward matter</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h02m45s">he was a very visionary person by which
I mean he had an incredible visual</a>
00:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h02m49s">imagination and he used that a lot he
used it in his therapy practice I</a>
00:02:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h02m53s">believe that most of his therapy clients
were high in trade openness I have a lot</a>

00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h03m01s">because I'm high and trade openness and
you know they watch my videos and that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h03m05s">sort of thing and they're interested in
what I'm doing and many of them are</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h03m09s">astute dreamers and prolific dreamers
and many open people in my experience</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h03m50s">don't and then when they went to Freud
they had Freudian dreams and I don't</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h04m16s">those dreams our problem with archetypal

generally and in personality courses the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h04m45s">temporal order of their thought but I
think it's better to start with Jung</a>
00:04:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h04m49s">because it's it's as if you Freud
excavated into the basement and then</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h04m53s">Jung excavated into many many floors

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h05m03s">of thinking towards Freud it's better to
go through young because Jung is I think</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h05m07s">I think Freudian theory is a subset of

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h17m27s">this isn't just a lecture by a

the animals are also in representations</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h18m12s">sexual and aggressive in particular as

he's also hyper intelligent and rational</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h34m14s">reason for that as far as I can tell and
this is something that Milton figured</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h34m29s">right and so then it comes up with a
theory that makes that a totality and</a>
00:34:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h34m33s">then it won't let go so the rational

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h35m57s">straightforwardly that the reason that

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h36m12s">quite cool but the Egyptians said

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h36m16s">got overthrown by set was because he was

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h36m21s">blind same idea as the flood myth you
don't see that quite here because Mufasa</a>
00:36:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h36m26s">is sort of on to set or to scar but scar
is more treacherous than Mufasa believes</a>
00:36:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h36m31s">and he gets at he gets at Mufasa by

00:36:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h36m42s">so obviously there's some antagonism
between these two as you can see by</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h36m46s">their facial expressions there and there

Mufasa has taken taken Simba up to the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h47m08s">elephant's graveyard right and and
there's there's bones everywhere and so</a>
00:47:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h47m13s">now they're out into the kingdom of
death and what that means is that these</a>
00:47:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h47m16s">two kids as they've grown up encounter
death right they go outside the light</a>
00:47:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h47m21s">it's very very shocking for them they're
very curious about it obviously they go</a>
00:47:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h47m26s">to explore the skeletons and all of that
even though they were told not to but</a>
00:47:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h47m30s">their curiosity they can't stay away
from death they're too curious about it</a>
00:47:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h47m34s">and so they developed knowledge of death
and that and then of course out there in</a>
00:47:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h47m38s">the Deadlands is where the hyenas are
and that's exactly right because hyenas</a>
00:47:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h47m42s">are scavengers right and they can break
bones with their teeth they're really</a>
00:47:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h47m46s">really quite the animal and you know you
kind of have a shudder of repugnance</a>
00:47:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h47m50s">when you see those things
and I think it's partly I mean we shared</a>
00:47:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h47m54s">an evolutionary landscape with the
ancestors of hyenas for a very very long</a>
00:47:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h47m57s">time and like vultures too you know you
couldn't imagine something that would be</a>
00:47:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h48m02s">more well designed to look like it was a
horrible thing than a vulture right and</a>
00:48:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h48m07s">there's this weird concordance and crows
and ravens are like that - carrion</a>
00:48:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h48m11s">eaters you know the Eagles are kind of
an exception but they look just as</a>
00:48:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h48m15s">creepy as they are which is really quite
interesting and of course hyenas fall</a>
00:48:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h48m19s">into that category and they laugh -
which is you know really you you also</a>
00:48:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h48m23s">have to laugh really with all these
other things you have going for you and</a>
00:48:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h48m27s">anyways the hyenas and hyenas are
enemies of lions and they can take lions</a>
00:48:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h48m31s">down they're tough things and you know
they're not one high in obviously but a</a>
00:48:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h48m35s">bunch of hyenas can give a lie in a
pretty damn rough time</a>
00:48:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h48m38s">and so and these little lines are really
no match for the hyenas so they get</a>
00:48:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h48m43s">threatened very very rapidly and one of
the hyenas of course is just completely</a>
00:48:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h48m48s">out of its mind and one of the things
that's really interesting and you see</a>
00:48:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h48m52s">this with the Muppets - there was often
a puppet that was like a crazy puppet</a>
00:48:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h48m55s">and its eyes would move in different
directions you know and one of the</a>
00:48:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h48m58s">things that happens with people who are
schizophrenic is they show involuntary</a>
00:48:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h49m01s">eye movements and it's because you have
a brain center that controls your eyes</a>
00:49:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h49m05s">voluntarily and you have another one
that controls them involuntarily so you</a>
00:49:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h49m09s">can see that look ahead and try to move
your eyes smoothly back and forth you</a>
00:49:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h49m13s">can't do it you'll see that they jerk
hey but if you watch put a finger in</a>
00:49:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h49m17s">front of your face and then do this
they'll move perfectly smoothly and</a>
00:49:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h49m21s">that's because you're using different
eye control centers one voluntary and</a>
00:49:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h49m25s">one more involuntary and the involuntary
one is actually more sophisticated and</a>
00:49:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h49m29s">so in schizophrenic the involuntary eye
control centers tend to disrupt the</a>
00:49:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h49m34s">voluntary eye control centers and that's
likely part of the hallucinatory process</a>
00:49:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h49m39s">you know because you have the ego in
this schizophrenic that's being</a>
00:49:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h49m42s">disrupted by processes underneath
fantasies and that sort of thing and</a>
00:49:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h49m46s">that looks like it's reflected in
involuntary eye movements like like</a>
00:49:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h49m49s">dream movements so anyways so much for
the crazy hyena and they're in real</a>
00:49:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h49m54s">trouble now the Kings I who's supposed
to be keeping an eye on this and was</a>
00:49:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h49m57s">supposed to be watching Simba is trying
to intervene but I mean look at him he's</a>
00:49:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h50m01s">a like a delicious little bird and so
that's not working out very well</a>
00:50:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h50m05s">anyways and then you see this immediate
juxtaposition of the domain of death and</a>
00:50:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h50m11s">the hyenas with hell right and everyone
looks at that and they think well they</a>
00:50:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h50m15s">know exactly what that means it's no
surprise to anyone that that happens and</a>
00:50:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h50m19s">I suppose that's partly because on the
veldt where we evolved in large part but</a>
00:50:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h50m24s">not by no means all part fire was an
ever-present danger in the grasslands</a>
00:50:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h50m28s">right and so and so that's a good that's
a good example of Hell so huh well I</a>
00:50:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI#t=00h50m37s">guess that's it we'll do some more of
this when we meet on Tuesday bye</a>
