<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h00m44s">I mean, he was a very weird mystical sort of person, you know</a>
01:00:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h00m47s">And he he made claims or some of his characters did but on his behalf that you know</a>
01:00:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h00m52s">Not only are you responsible for everything you do?</a>
01:00:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h00m54s">But in some sense you're responsible for everything that everyone else does too and you think well</a>
01:00:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h00m59s">Obviously there's a way in which that isn't true</a>
01:00:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h01m02s">you know, it's delusional in some sense, but there's another way in which it actually is true, you know, and so</a>
01:01:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h01m09s">Well, I I wrote a book called extreme ownership and it's it's very inner soul. Also all this is a whole</a>
01:01:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h01m16s">Thought here, so, you know when I read the book about face, which is not about leadership. It's not a leadership book</a>
01:01:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h01m23s">It's a it's a book about a guy that was in the leadership position, but he doesn't say here's how you lead</a>
01:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h01m27s">Here's what you do here. It's a book about his experience and what I took away from it, especially because I was in leadership positions</a>
01:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h01m33s">In in the military in combat situations that I started seeing all these leadership things that he did and there's all this crossover</a>
01:01:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h01m41s">because</a>
01:01:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h01m42s">For instance and so for me the crossover was well</a>
01:01:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h01m45s">I</a>
01:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h01m46s">Started learning about tactics when  was a young kid because  was in the military and the SEAL Teams and you had to learn</a>
01:01:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h01m50s">about how to fire and maneuver like that's what you do and</a>
01:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h01m53s">Then so you start learning about leadership and then I started training a lot of jujitsu</a>
01:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h01m57s">And so those things kind of all fit together and it's very strange how those things started to weave together in my head</a>
01:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h02m04s">that oh if</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h02m19s">no, you start to choke them and while they're defending the choke then you get their arm and</a>
01:02:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h02m24s">As a leader if you want somebody to do something you just don't bark that order at them you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h04m16s">Let me tell you the situation and instead of men you want to be able to do that</a>
01:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h04m20s">You want to be able to teach your subordinates to do that without being insubordinate right? Because then it's not a power play</a>
01:04:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h04m25s">It's that your your interests are aligned</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h04m41s">Um, I want to make sure I'm executing this exactly how you want it. Can you explain to me why we're doing this?</a>
01:04:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h04m46s">So I can really really make it happen out there in the field, you know, and that's a key thing. So so these ideas of</a>
01:04:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h04m55s">You know psychology I guess now is I</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h04m58s">Hate to use that word, but because I was just calling a human nature, but these ideas they all kind of come together</a>
01:04:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h05m02s">And so now you're talking about</a>
01:05:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h05m05s">Ownership right extreme ownership and this idea that hey I'm responsible for everything. And and so here's what I'm getting from a leader. Hmm</a>
01:05:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h05m14s">They'll say well whether it's a business leader or or it's it's very easy to use a military leader</a>
01:05:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h05m18s">So I'll get a platoon commander my machine gunner shot in the wrong direction</a>
01:05:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h05m23s">How can that be my fault?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h05m25s">Mm-hm because my machine gunner shot in the wrong - I'm not I'm not holding his weight and I'm not pulling his truck</a>
01:05:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h05m30s">How can that possibly be my fault? That's not my fault</a>
01:05:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h05m34s">wrong</a>
01:05:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h05m35s">Who's in charge of that machine gun who's in charge of making sure he what is fields of fire?</a>
01:05:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h05m39s">Who's in charge of making sure he understands when and where he's allowed to shoot you are you're the boss</a>
01:05:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h05m44s">This is absolutely your fault had it</a>
01:05:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h05m46s">another interesting example of the weather</a>
01:05:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h05m49s">The weather is bad. We couldn't execute our mission. That's why we failed because we couldn't launch our helicopter. Yeah, it's not my fault. Yeah</a>
01:05:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h05m56s">That's a hard one to argue against. Yeah, except for the fact that if you're a good leader, you'll say hey, here's our plan</a>
01:05:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h06m02s">We're gonna use these helicopters and here's our contingency</a>
01:06:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h06m04s">Yeah, right if there's bad weather, you know</a>
01:06:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h06m06s">If you don't take that ownership of what's going on, if you don't take responsibility for it, you're not gonna change it</a>
01:06:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h06m12s">you're not gonna fix it and</a>
01:06:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h06m14s">That means you're never getting any better. You're not gonna win, right but the minute us end this and obviously</a>
01:06:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h06m20s">This applies to you know people to purple in you and you know, you tell people to take responsibility</a>
01:06:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h06m25s">I've you know, tell them take ownership, but what's going on in your world?</a>
01:06:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h06m28s">it's this it's the same thing, but at the end well</a>
01:06:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h06m30s">It's also it also seems to me to be the case</a>
01:06:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h06m32s">and I think that this is part of the ethic that's embedded in in it's deeply embedded in Christianity with the idea that</a>
01:06:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h06m42s">The idea that the ultimate sacrifice that you can offer to the world is the sacrifice of yourself</a>
01:06:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h06m47s">It's like well imagine that you have to sacrifice something to set the world right while you do</a>
01:06:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h06m52s">Obviously because you have to give up things now in order to make things better in the future</a>
01:06:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h06m56s">So the sacrificial idea is a very deep one</a>
01:06:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h06m59s">then the question might be well, well if you're gonna sacrifice something</a>
01:06:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h07m03s">is it going to be someone else or is it going to be you and</a>
01:07:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h07m06s">I really think that's the fundamental question and the right answer to that is that it's going to be you it's your fault</a>
01:07:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h07m11s">Right you take that on or at least you take on that responsibility and it is it's a weird thing weirdly</a>
01:07:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXcg9GWIIM#t=01h07m18s">Difficult to distinguish fault and responsibility, I think</a>
01:07:18</p>
