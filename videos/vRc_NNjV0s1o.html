<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_NNjV0s1o#t=00h04m48s">And the data on that is clear. Of course, there are exceptions,</a>
00:04:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_NNjV0s1o#t=00h04m52s">because there are terrible biological parents and great stepparents.</a>
00:04:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_NNjV0s1o#t=00h04m56s">But when you look at the average ...</a>
00:04:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_NNjV0s1o#t=00h04m58s">It is not easy to take care of children.</a>
00:04:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_NNjV0s1o#t=00h05m01s">You need to be tied to them as best you can.</a>
00:05:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_NNjV0s1o#t=00h05m05s">And when they are someone else's children?</a>
00:05:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_NNjV0s1o#t=00h05m08s">It usually stands in the way of the person you love.</a>
00:05:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_NNjV0s1o#t=00h05m12s">That?</a>
00:05:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_NNjV0s1o#t=00h05m14s">Let's say you have a baby.</a>
00:05:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_NNjV0s1o#t=00h05m18s">And I want to invite you out.</a>
00:05:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_NNjV0s1o#t=00h05m21s">Every second you spend with a child is every second you don't spend with me.</a>
00:05:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_NNjV0s1o#t=00h05m26s">It will cost you something. And I won't be thrilled.</a>
00:05:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_NNjV0s1o#t=00h05m29s">And if I had a baby, you would feel exactly the same.</a>
00:05:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_NNjV0s1o#t=00h05m32s">You can say, "I love kids."</a>
00:05:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_NNjV0s1o#t=00h05m34s">Yeah, sure.</a>
00:05:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_NNjV0s1o#t=00h05m36s">Of course.</a>
00:05:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_NNjV0s1o#t=00h05m37s">I doubt it.</a>
00:05:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_NNjV0s1o#t=00h05m38s">You can love your baby.</a>
00:05:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_NNjV0s1o#t=00h05m41s">And people love children in a specific way.</a>
00:05:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_NNjV0s1o#t=00h05m45s">And the rate of child abuse by stepparents is much higher than by biological parents.</a>
00:05:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc_NNjV0s1o#t=00h05m51s">This cannot be compared at all.</a>
