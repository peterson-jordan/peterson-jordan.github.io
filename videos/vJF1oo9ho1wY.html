00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h00m03s">and this idea of committing one's life to that.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h00m07s">[Dr. Peterson] At a minimum! I mean, that's just the obvious thing that you could do.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h00m11s">[Interviewer] A lot of students, I think, accept that premise and view what they're doing as trying to</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h00m16s">eliminate or reduce unnecessary suffering,</a>
00:00:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h00m19s">and they see activism or other forms of direct service as fulfilling that goal.</a>
00:00:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h00m23s">Do you simply disagree with, like the content of what they think,</a>

00:00:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h00m31s">or do you think, that their motives or their intentions are not even the same as yours?</a>
00:00:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h00m38s">[pensive moment]</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h00m42s">[Dr. Peterson] It's too public. You know, there's this old saying fom the New Testament about not praying in public.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h00m49s">[Interviewer] Hmm.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h00m49s">[Dr. Peterson] And the idea is, that if you're going to commune for the higher good, you should do it in private.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h00m54s">Because otherwise, you're warping your ethic in some sense, by demonstrating how virtuous you are to the world.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h01m00s">It's like you know, I'm- You go out there with a stick and a sign on it, that says "I'm against poverty".</a>
00:01:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h01m05s">It's like: yeah, no kidding, man. Really.</a>
00:01:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h01m07s">Like, who's FOR poverty? Noone's for poverty.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h01m29s">You know? It's like, there are things that you should be doing in the confines of your own life,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h01m33s">that are private and humble, that would constitute genuine accomplishments.</a>
00:01:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h01m38s">And those are the things that you should attend to.</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h01m39s">And no one's gonna come along and say: "Hey, you know, good job! You're changing the world."</a>
00:01:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h01m44s">Because it's private. But it's real!</a>
00:01:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h01m47s">And people don't do that. So no, I don't trust the activists...</a>
00:01:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h01m51s">I don't trust the activists' ethos at all.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h01m57s">superficial and trendy, and too easy, and...</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h02m06s">it externalizes the blame - the evil is always elsewhere, which is a dreadful mistake to make.</a>
00:02:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h02m12s">Because the evil isn't elsewhere. That's the thing that you understand when you're wise,</a>
00:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h02m17s">is the evil is not elsewhere. It's you.</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h02m20s">Because you're not everything you could be.</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h02m22s">And so you know, you should work on that before going and telling someone else, that maybe they're not who they should be.</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h02m27s">So, I think it's... you know, I don't buy it, it's too easy.</a>
00:02:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h02m31s">It's far too easy, and it's too public, and it's too self congratulatory.</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h02m36s">And then there's the murderous, like Marxist element - which you know, I'm always often inclined to mention.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h02m42s">[Interviewer] So certainly I think you've identified certain causes, where the public element</a>
00:02:42</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h02m48s">or the self-congratulatory virtue trying to do good could be harmful,</a>
00:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h02m53s">but do you think there are cases - for instance, I'm thinking of policy,</a>
00:02:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h02m56s">influencing policy, being a policy maker.</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h02m58s">It seems like something like that - public policy - could be used to eliminate some unnecessary suffering,</a>
00:02:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h03m06s">but would involve a more public domain, something where you are trying to attract...</a>
00:03:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h03m11s">followers, trying to attract praise from other people.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h03m13s">[Dr. Peterson] Look, if you've established yourself in the world as a credible human being,</a>
00:03:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h03m19s">and people are asking you to enter public service because of your accomplishments,</a>
00:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h03m24s">then it's time to do it, right.</a>
00:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h03m27s">But before that, it's a little on the premature side.</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h03m30s">And if you're just setting yourself forward as an avatar of an ideology,</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h03m35s">then there's nothing to you, except I think of it as the chattering of various forms of demons.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h03m40s">It's like, you're not helpful.</a>
00:03:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h03m42s">And if you... Look, you [might] wanna think "Okay, are you fit to lead?"</a>
00:03:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h03m45s">Let's put it that way. Okay, first of all:</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h03m48s">Do you know where you're going? Because that's actually one of the hallmarks of a leader - leader knows where he's going.</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h03m53s">And maybe other people are also interested in going that way.</a>
00:03:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h03m56s">But the leaders I've met, have carved themselves out a personal vision, right?</a>
00:03:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h04m00s">It's not some cookie cutter ideological solution to the ills of the planet.</a>
00:04:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h04m05s">They've done a detailed analysis, right? They know what they're talking about. And they're usually people...</a>
00:04:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h04m10s">Well, they've had a successful relationship. They've had a successful family.</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h04m13s">They have a couple of degrees. They've established a business.</a>
00:04:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h04m16s">Like, they've made themselves credible in 5 or 6 dimensions!</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h04m20s">Well, then maybe you know enough about the world, to DARE to mess with its internal mechanisms.</a>
00:04:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h04m24s">And if you don't have that kind of in-depth knowledge, then you should just...</a>
00:04:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h04m28s">you shouldn't... you should no more work on the economic systems of Western civilization,</a>
00:04:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h04m33s">then you should try to adjust the electronic systems of your automobile.</a>
00:04:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h04m38s">Because the latter is far less complex than the former.</a>
00:04:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h04m42s">So of course there is utility in policy formulation and in government service, and in all of those sorts of things.</a>
00:04:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h04m48s">But you have to have transformed yourself, at least to some degree, into someone who's actually competent,</a>
00:04:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h04m54s">before you should even dare to do such things.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h05m03s">That's a very bad idea. Because the probability, that you're gonna take something complex,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1oo9ho1wY#t=00h05m07s">that doesn't work too badly, and fix it with your idiotic intervention - is zero. So...</a>
