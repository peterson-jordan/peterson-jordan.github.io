you through the nervous system a little bit</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h00m32s">and we started with the monkey business illusion,
and one of the things that's really remarkable</a>
00:00:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h00m38s">about the monkey business illusion is that--and

you could either describe yourself as blind</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h00m52s">And I think focused is actually better than

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h01m00s">And people are sort of like that, we're really
beamed into a single point and there's something</a>
00:01:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h01m05s">metaphysically spectacular about that, I think,
because that single point that we're narrowed</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h01m12s">down to is in some sense the thing that writes

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h01m18s">with the world we're able to turn it one way

00:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h01m23s">And, I mean, I know our powers of doing so
are obviously constrained to a substantial</a>

00:01:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h01m34s">with the world and then, at least seemingly,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h01m45s">then it transforms itself into a past that's
in some sense fixed and real.</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h01m51s">So that's pretty strange.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h02m07s">So, this here is a little diagram of a computer,
believe it or not--a conceptual diagram of</a>
00:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h02m16s">a computer--and it's predicated on...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h02m22s">I'll tell you a quick story.</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h02m24s">If I've told you this story please stop me,
but I don't think I've told you guys this</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h02m29s">story.</a>
00:02:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h02m30s">So one day back in about 1987 I was working
on my computer and I was typing some long</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h02m39s">essay in DOS and, you really had to back up
in those days because the programs didn't</a>
00:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h02m45s">do any back up for you and so if the program
shut off and you hadn't been super careful</a>
00:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h02m49s">you were just going to lose all of it.</a>
00:02:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h02m50s">And so that's what happened--I was typing
when the computer went off and so, I had an</a>
00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h02m55s">emotional reaction to that.</a>
00:02:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h02m58s">Right, now an emotional reaction to that is
kind of an interesting event because, I would</a>
00:02:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h03m03s">say that you're not even working with the
computer until it quits.</a>
00:03:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h03m08s">And the reason I would say that is because,
if you think about it, when the computer is</a>
00:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h03m11s">functioning the fact that it's an extraordinarily
complicated device is basically irrelevant</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h03m16s">to you.</a>
00:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h03m17s">What you're working with, roughly speaking,
is the screen, but not really, not even the</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h03m22s">screen.</a>
00:03:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h03m23s">You're working with maybe a phrase or even
the word that's presented on the </a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h03m29s">You know, you're typing the word/phrase/sentence/paragraph/essay,
and only out past that domain of consideration</a>
00:03:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h03m37s">do you start thinking about the hardware technology
that underlies what you're doing.</a>
00:03:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h03m42s">You don't want to think about that at all.</a>
00:03:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h03m45s">When something's working, you don't have to
see it.</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h03m49s">And so that gives you a clue as to consciousness.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h03m51s">Consciousness is an error detecting and correcting
phenomena, and you're not conscious of things</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h04m00s">You know, which might explain to some degree
why a lot of our life seems to be made up</a>
00:04:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h04m04s">of suffering.</a>
00:04:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h04m05s">If things are going well, it isn't exactly
like you're happy if things are going well,</a>
00:04:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h04m10s">you just don't notice when they're going well.</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h04m13s">Sometimes if they unexpectedly go well, then
that makes you happy.</a>
00:04:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h04m17s">But otherwise it's just the same old thing,
even if it's amazing.</a>
00:04:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h04m24s">I was--yesterday--I was eating breakfast with
my son and I was complaining about the fact</a>
00:04:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h04m28s">that I had to eat canned-smoked tuna because
I don't really like fish, but I have to eat</a>
00:04:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h04m32s">fish for a variety of different reasons.</a>
00:04:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h04m34s">And I thought, Jesus, what're you complaining
about?</a>
00:04:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h04m37s">I mean, really, do you know what a tuna is
like?</a>
00:04:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h04m40s">Those things are like small whales, right;
they weigh like 600 pounds, they're impossible</a>
00:04:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h04m45s">to catch.</a>
00:04:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h04m46s">So there's some poor characters out there
hauling in tuna, which is impossible--and</a>
00:04:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h04m51s">then they have to clean them and freeze them
and smoke them and can them--and all I have</a>
00:04:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h04m54s">to do is go to the store and pick up this
can of tuna and then I can complain about</a>
00:04:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h04m58s">it for breakfast.</a>
00:04:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h05m00s">It's really quite staggering, the fact that
I can ever eat tuna is a complete bloody miracle.</a>
00:05:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h05m07s">But it's not the sort of thing that makes
me happy because I just expect that.</a>
00:05:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h05m11s">Which is very pathetic, but that's how it
goes.</a>
00:05:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h05m15s">So anyways, back to the computer.</a>
00:05:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h05m17s">So, it stops working--well, and that's what
I would say I notice the computer.</a>
00:05:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h05m22s">And there's nothing more annoying then noticing
a computer when you're in the middle of writing</a>
00:05:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h05m26s">an essay because, what the hell do you know
about computers?</a>
00:05:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h05m29s">Nothing.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h05m33s">Well that's like problem solving process number
1.</a>
00:05:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h05m38s">It usually works--thank god--but if it doesn't
work you're into either the software or the</a>

00:05:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h05m44s">So anyways, I turned it on and off and that
didn't work, and so then I turned on a light</a>
00:05:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h05m49s">to see if I could see if something had happened

00:05:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h05m53s">But the light didn't go on so I thought, aha,
the power probably went out or I blew a fuse,</a>
00:05:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h05m56s">so I went out to see if the fuse was burnt

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h06m05s">went outside to go to the corner store to

00:06:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h06m27s">Because there was a solar flare.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h06m32s">So I don't know if you guys know this--a cheerful

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h06m40s">a hydrogen bomb has an atom bomb for its trigger,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h06m46s">You need to know that because it's important.</a>
00:06:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h06m47s">Because an atom bomb is a big thing, but it's
just a trigger for a hydrogen bomb, so a hydrogen</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h06m56s">Anyways, if you blew a hydrogen bomb in the
atmosphere over Central North America, you</a>
00:06:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h07m00s">could probably wipe out maybe all of the electronic

00:07:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h07m08s">Because what happens is when a hydrogen bomb
goes off, there's an electromagnetic burst,</a>
00:07:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h07m12s">and as the propagates it'll hit your electronic

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h07m32s">And also, just to cheer you up even more,
back in the late 1800s, I think it was the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h07m37s">1860s, there was this--oh let's go back to
the sun.</a>
00:07:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h07m43s">So the sun's a big hydrogen bomb and now and
then it freaks out and emits a big solar flare,</a>
00:07:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h07m49s">which is something that's gone wrong on the

00:07:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h07m51s">And maybe it blows out this solar flare almost
to the orbit of mercury, and then that burst</a>

00:08:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h08m11s">And that's what happened.</a>
00:08:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h08m12s">So the reason my computer didn't work is because
the sun was misbehaving.</a>
00:08:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h08m17s">And so, I like that.</a>
00:08:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h08m18s">It was very illuminating to me because it
just shows you how many things need to be</a>

for some thing that you're doing to actually</a>

00:08:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h08m29s">So anyways, back in the late 1800s in the
1860s, there was a massive solar flare and</a>
00:08:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h08m34s">it produced a bust of power on telegraph lines
and it lit some telegraph operators on fire.</a>
00:08:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h08m41s">And so this does happen--it happens about
once a century, and we just missed one last</a>
00:08:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h08m44s">year.</a>
00:08:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h08m45s">So while you're worrying about global warming
you can be considering the much higher probability</a>
00:08:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h08m52s">that a solar flare will knock out all of our
electronics and send us back to like 1860.</a>
00:08:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h08m55s">So the point is that, first of all, there's
a lot of things going on to make up an object</a>
00:08:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h09m04s">that you don't detect with your vision.</a>
00:09:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h09m05s">You never think that the reason the computer
works is because the sun is acting properly.</a>
00:09:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h09m11s">But it is of course the case that endless
number of things have to be stabilized that</a>
00:09:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h09m17s">you don't see.</a>
00:09:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h09m18s">And you might say, well the sun isn't part
of the computer but well, that's wrong.</a>
00:09:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h09m22s">It's not part of the computer in some sense
when it's behaving, but as soon as it stops</a>
00:09:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h09m26s">behaving it's instantly part of the computer.</a>
00:09:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h09m29s">So here we've got--you might say, well let's
say the power hadn't gone out and the computer</a>
00:09:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h09m36s">stopped working.</a>
00:09:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h09m37s">Well then you might think, well I'll never
buy that brand again.</a>
00:09:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h09m42s">And maybe the brand is associated with operation
in some country where corruption is rife and</a>
00:09:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h09m51s">things are made improperly and the parts don't
work very well.</a>
00:09:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h09m53s">So you might think, well I made a stupid purchase
decision.</a>
00:09:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h09m55s">And of course that's connected to the political
system of that place and the economy.</a>
00:09:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h10m01s">And then weird little things can happen down
at the micro level as well as the macro level.</a>
00:10:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h10m06s">So computer chips have now got so small--you
know they have little wires in them right,</a>
00:10:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h10m12s">the chips--the wires are now so small that
because of quantum uncertainty.</a>
00:10:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h10m16s">So quantum uncertainty basically tells you
that you can't really tell where an electron</a>
00:10:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h10m20s">is if you want to know how fast it's going.</a>
00:10:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h10m23s">And you can't tell how fast it's going if
you want to know where it is.</a>
00:10:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h10m26s">But more than that it says you can't really
know where the thing is, and so what that</a>
00:10:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h10m30s">means is that once you get your wire short
enough, some of the electrons might not be</a>
00:10:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h10m33s">in the wires where they're supposed to be,
and they actually cause short circuits.</a>
00:10:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h10m38s">So that's another issue.</a>
00:10:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h10m40s">There's other levels of reality that are micro
levels that you can't detect at all.</a>
00:10:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h10m43s">So there's macro levels that are way beyond
you, you know, political systems, economic</a>
00:10:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h10m47s">systems, biological systems, physical systems
outside of that.</a>
00:10:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h10m51s">And then there are these Microsystems layered
all the way down, and things can go wrong</a>
00:10:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h10m55s">at any one of those levels and a lot of that
is invisible to us.</a>
00:10:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h11m01s">The same thing happens when something goes
wrong with you.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h11m04s">It's like, what's wrong with you?</a>
00:11:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h11m07s">Maybe you're malfunctioning at the molecular

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h11m13s">Or maybe some virus which is even smaller
than the DNA comes in and takes up residence</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h11m19s">and that's really not so good.</a>
00:11:19</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h11m25s">Or maybe your family's screwed up and you're

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h11m29s">screwed up is because you live in, let's say

you're sick is because of people's inability</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h12m16s">Well the answer to that is evolution, fundamentally.</a>
00:12:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h12m23s">You can view evolution in the following way.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h12m25s">You can kind of think about the background

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h12m31s">about it is as this interplay of patterns,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h12m50s">to the music.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h12m51s">And it keeps changing on you so, well, what
do you do?</a>
00:12:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h12m54s">Well if you can change then you can change

00:12:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h12m58s">But if you can't change then that's it.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h13m01s">You're not dancing anymore.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h13m02s">Okay, so let's assume that there's two ways
of solving that problem.</a>
00:13:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h13m05s">One way is just sheer number.</a>
00:13:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h13m08s">You're a single celled organism or a mosquito
and you don't have that much neurocapacity</a>
00:13:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h13m13s">for transformation and so you don't know what
the melody is going to be when you lay your</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h13m17s">eggs if you're a mosquito and so you produce
like a million eggs and some of them can dance</a>
00:13:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h13m23s">to the current beat and the others can't,
and so they all die.</a>
00:13:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h13m27s">And so that's what happens over the course
of evolution for a very very long time.</a>
00:13:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h13m30s">The melody keeps changing and then what creatures
do is propagate a whole variety of variants</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h13m36s">of themselves, and in the case of small animals

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h13m49s">And then you know, we get three and a half
billion years later, roughly speaking, here</a>
00:13:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h13m53s">we all are and what we've got is this dynamic
nervous system.</a>
00:13:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h13m57s">And it enables us to take an external pattern

00:14:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h14m11s">And so in some sense, what we've done is we're
internalised the process of evolutionary variation</a>
00:14:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h14m17s">into ourselves.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h14m19s">And the more complex, roughly speaking, the
more layers your nervous system has--imagine</a>
00:14:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h14m24s">there's a pattern on your skin, and then that's
interpreted by a pattern of nerves, and then</a>
00:14:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h14m29s">those nerves have an output, they're sensory

00:14:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h14m36s">That's you, roughly.</a>
00:14:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h14m38s">You're maybe a four-layer thing in that regard.</a>
00:14:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h14m41s">But then you grow all these extra layers of
neural tissue, so that the layers are hundreds</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h14m50s">And then you can map a whole bunch of patterns

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h15m00s">and so that makes you dynamically adaptable.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h15m03s">But you learned all that through this incredibly

00:15:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h15m21s">Well, how do you figure out how to focus in
on something?</a>
00:15:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h15m23s">Well, a big part of that is actually--let's
see how we do it.</a>
00:15:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h15m31s">Well first of all, what are you focusing in
on here?</a>
00:15:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h15m34s">Well not poisonous snakes, and rampaging lions

00:15:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h15m37s">Because they're not in here.</a>
00:15:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h15m39s">And the reason they're not in here, roughly
speaking, is because you live in a culture</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h15m44s">that's very very highly advanced and it's

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h15m55s">It's like, well you can't deal with much.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h15m58s">Build some walls, keep a bunch of stuff out.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h23m03s">terms are particularly well-defined.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h24m18s">Well, in some sense the motivational system
specifies the map and the goal.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h24m27s">It's a little more complicated than that because
it also specifies where you are.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h24m30s">But you can think about it as a map with a

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h24m39s">And then what emotions do, roughly speaking,
is tell you whether or not things are going</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h24m46s">the way you want them to as you're on that

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h24m49s">And so the emotions in some sense have to

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h25m37s">And I think the reason for that--I thought
about that for a long time--why is it worse</a>
00:25:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h25m42s">to fail out of university, assuming you want
to be in university, than it is to fail an</a>
00:25:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h25m46s">exam?</a>
00:25:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h25m47s">How does your brain compute that?</a>
00:25:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h25m49s">Because you can't tell all the consequences,
right, so it's not self evident.</a>
00:25:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h25m53s">But it seems to me that it's something like,
you think about these functional sub-personalities</a>
00:25:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h26m02s">as having a temporal and spatial range of
application.</a>
00:26:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h26m08s">So if you're a university student you're sort
of stabilized for four years.</a>
00:26:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h26m12s">Wherever you go, people say "what do you do?"
and you can say "I’m a university student."</a>
00:26:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h26m17s">And everybody's happy about that.</a>
00:26:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h26m21s">From an economic perspective it's probably
worse than being unemployed, in some sense,</a>
00:26:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h26m27s">but you can't just go tell people that you're
unemployed and then you have a nice little</a>
00:26:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h26m31s">high-status slot in society.</a>
00:26:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h26m32s">It doesn't work that way.</a>
00:26:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h26m33s">But you can do that as a university student,
you know, so it fulfills your social obligations</a>
00:26:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h26m37s">and it makes you feel like you're doing something
at least vaguely useful--I mean apart from</a>
00:26:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h26m43s">the learning and all the other things that
are positive about it.</a>
00:26:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h26m45s">So what happens is that that map basically
covers that space and time--the time is four</a>
00:26:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h26m51s">years and the space is everywhere you go during
those four years.</a>
00:26:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h26m55s">Then if that map burns up it's like you're
exposed on all fronts for that entire four</a>
00:26:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h27m00s">year period.</a>
00:27:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h27m01s">And that might even be the two years previously.</a>
00:27:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h27m05s">For example--strange to think that, but if
you bail out of university half way through</a>
00:27:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h27m11s">your third year, you've also destructured
the map that you used to organize your memories,</a>
00:27:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h27m18s">in some sense, of the previous two and a half
years.</a>
00:27:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h27m21s">Because first of all they were the memories
of somewone who was doing just fine and going</a>
00:27:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h27m24s">through university, and now all of a sudden
they're the memories of someone who failed.</a>
00:27:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h27m28s">Those aren't the same memories.</a>
00:27:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h27m30s">And so it's weird that an error can alter
the past, but it can and often does.</a>
00:27:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h27m38s">I mean any relationship breakup that's of
any significance will do exactly the same</a>
00:27:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h27m43s">thing, especially if you were betrayed, right.</a>
00:27:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h27m45s">It's like, it's not just the present and the
future that dissolve into chaos and take you</a>
00:27:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h27m50s">on a little trip to the underworld.</a>
00:27:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h27m52s">It's also your revision--the necessity of
revising your past.</a>
00:27:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h27m58s">So anyways, so then I would say well--failing
a class--well the class restructures you in</a>
00:27:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h28m03s">some sense and focuses you for a certain subset
of the general going-to-university map.</a>
00:28:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h28m08s">So it's going to be less traumatizing to do
poorly on a class than it is to fail out of</a>
00:28:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h28m14s">university because the amount of space and
time that those respective maps covers differs.</a>
00:28:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h28m21s">So what you're trying to do always is to lay
out a functional game--that's a good way of</a>
00:28:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h28m28s">thinking about it--on the space-time territory
that you inhabit.</a>
00:28:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h28m31s">And if you understand that then you can start
to understand a little bit about emotions.</a>
00:28:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h28m36s">Now, okay, I have to put a little coda in
there and that's: motivations and emotions</a>
00:28:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h28m45s">are not technical terms.</a>
00:28:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h28m48s">They're sort of like id and ego.</a>
00:28:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h28m50s">They're terms that you can use to structure
a debate.</a>
00:28:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h28m54s">I showed you the hypothalamus and you see
it's made out of all those little nuclei--they're</a>
00:28:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h28m57s">not the same, so you can't say that every
part of the hypothalamus is doing something</a>
00:28:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h29m01s">that you can fit into a class: motivation.</a>
00:29:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h29m04s">And motivations and emotions overlap, so,
I would say hunger--some of them oversee more</a>
00:29:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h29m12s">purely motivation.</a>
00:29:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h29m15s">If you have an unsettling altercation with
someone, it tends not to make you hungry.</a>
00:29:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h29m21s">Whereas it might make you angry, it might
make you happy, it might make you sad.</a>
00:29:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h29m26s">So hunger is something that seems to pop up
one of these maps and then emotions guide</a>
00:29:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h29m32s">your way through it or tell you where you
are on it.</a>
00:29:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h29m35s">But then you have complex motivation-emotions
like pain, and also anger.</a>
00:29:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h29m41s">Because pain has a goal in it, right--get
away.</a>
00:29:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h29m45s">Or stop, or get away--it's usually get away--but
it also has an emotional feeling, right.</a>
00:29:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h29m50s">It feels bad.</a>
00:29:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h29m51s">So it feels like an emotion, pain.</a>
00:29:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h29m54s">Grief is like pain.</a>
00:29:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h29m56s">Disappointment is like pain.</a>
00:29:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h29m58s">Loneliness is like pain.</a>
00:29:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h30m01s">And I mean this technically--all of those
things can be addressed rather successfully</a>
00:30:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h30m05s">with opiates, by the way.</a>
00:30:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h30m07s">So technically they're the same.</a>
00:30:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h30m09s">But pain--is being hurt an emotion?</a>
00:30:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h30m13s">Well people will say that, "well I feel hurt."</a>
00:30:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h30m16s">Whatever.</a>
00:30:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h30m17s">And anger is another one of those that's sort
of ambivalent because anger has a goal, right:</a>
00:30:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h30m24s">remove obstacle.</a>
00:30:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h30m26s">Remove or destroy obstacle.</a>
00:30:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h30m27s">In a sense, that's the goal of anger.</a>
00:30:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h30m29s">But people talk about it as an emotion.</a>
00:30:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h30m32s">So we're oversimplifying.</a>
00:30:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h30m34s">But it doesn't matter because it's a useful
oversimplification and that's sort of what</a>
00:30:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h30m39s">a theory is: a useful oversimplification.</a>
00:30:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h30m41s">Alright, so 
I kind of laid out what I think are the basic</a>
00:30:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h30m49s">motivations there.</a>
00:30:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h30m51s">Hunger, thirst, pain, anger, thermoregulation--you
don't want to be too hot or too cold--panic</a>
00:30:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h31m00s">or escape, affiliation or care, sexual desire,
exploration, play.</a>
00:31:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h31m07s">And you can kind of divide those into self-maintenance
motivations and self-propagation motivations,</a>
00:31:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h31m12s">roughly speaking.</a>
00:31:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h31m15s">Sort of just a way to keep track of them.</a>
00:31:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h31m16s">And then emotions--so the hypothalamus is
involved in a lot of that.</a>
00:31:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h31m20s">It's not the only thing but it's involved
in a lot of that.</a>
00:31:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h31m24s">And so here's sort of how I've conceptualized
one of these maps.</a>
00:31:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h31m27s">And we've seen this thing before.</a>
00:31:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h31m29s">You're at point A because if you're using
a map, or if you're in a game, there's a starting</a>
00:31:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h31m35s">point or you're a player--either way there's
you there--and then you're going somewhere</a>
00:31:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h31m40s">and you have to do something to get there.</a>
00:31:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h31m42s">Okay, so that's the little map, and maybe
you have to go make a peanut butter sandwich</a>
00:31:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h31m45s">or you have to go turn the thermostat down
or you need to call your friend or whatever.</a>
00:31:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h31m49s">But it's the same kind of structure that you're
using in all those different situations.</a>
00:31:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h31m55s">And they switch, you know.</a>
00:31:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h31m56s">Now you're finished being hungry.</a>
00:31:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h31m58s">Now you're thirsty.</a>
00:31:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h32m00s">Then you're lonesome.</a>
00:32:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h32m02s">It's like Sisyphus.</a>
00:32:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h32m03s">It's one damn thing after another, roughly
speaking.</a>
00:32:03</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h35m39s">So even in that you see exploration and preparation

00:35:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h35m44s">And the exploratory circuit is a very very

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h37m07s">Okay so we talked about motivations as sort
of setting up this little frame.</a>
00:37:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h37m42s">And then we can talk about emotions.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h37m58s">Well, because you use up the least amount

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h38m19s">Well basically what happens is that you're

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h41m02s">What does that mean exactly?</a>
00:41:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h41m04s">Well it means that you had a little map on

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h41m09s">day and the map would correspond, and then
all of a sudden the map burned up and god</a>
00:41:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h41m13s">only knows what's going to happen to the day.</a>
00:41:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h41m15s">And so it's like the bottom has dropped out

00:41:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h41m18s">And so then you have to worry about your clothes
and catching cold and all those things.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h41m22s">And turning around and going home and what

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h41m27s">So basically that's the domain of chaos that

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h41m30s">So that's a negative thing, but it's also--the

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h41m38s">You know, because most of the things that
happen to you that are negative are also unexpected</a>
00:41:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h41m42s">because you don't go around trying to make

00:41:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h41m46s">So well, what happens when something negative

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h41m52s">Well, you get a negative emotion.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h41m58s">Those seem to be the big three.</a>
00:41:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h42m01s">And they're mediated by different systems.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h42m03s">We don't understand the disgust system very

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h42m35s">It depends on how you define physical damage.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h42m57s">might mean the whole damn structure just collapsed

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h43m03s">Now the behaviourists would have called that

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h43m14s">It's sort of built in bad.</a>
00:43:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h43m16s">And they would think about anxiety in response
to the unexpected as learned.</a>
00:43:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h43m22s">The behaviourists would think that you need

00:43:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h43m37s">But it turns out that it's more complicated
than that.</a>
00:43:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h43m40s">So what the behaviourists would think is that
pain in some sense is the fundamental negative</a>

00:43:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h43m46s">And then maybe you're a kid and you stand
up underneath a table and you whack your head</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h43m54s">And then when you go under the table now you
get anxious because you've learned that if</a>
00:43:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h43m58s">you stand up under the table, you bang your

00:43:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h44m01s">So anxiety under those circumstances is a

00:44:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h44m04s">It's a conditioned response.</a>

00:44:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h44m07s">Okay, but it's more complicated than that
because anxiety can also be an unlearned response.</a>
00:44:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h44m13s">So if you just encounter something you've

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h44m19s">There's actually a circuit that mediates anxiety.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h44m22s">It's not just a secondary derivation of the
pain circuitry.</a>
00:44:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h44m26s">It's its own little unit.</a>
00:44:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h44m28s">And it's sort of like you've figured out over
time--evolutionary time--not to get hurt because</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h44m35s">But then, you've learned how to detect the
probability that you will get hurt for so</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h44m41s">long that you've also evolved a system just

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h48m58s">But it turns out it's a pretty good model,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h49m34s">So now the behaviourists also thought that

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h49m39s">them unconditioned, and then you had to learn
that some things predicted them.</a>
00:49:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h49m45s">Like, classically maybe, a rat would push

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h49m52s">Soon he's pushing that lever like mad.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h49m56s">And he learned the conditioned association

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h50m01s">But it turns out that because that's been
around for so long, you also have a system</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h50m07s">So it's not just a learned association to
what satiates you--it's a whole system.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h50m11s">And that's the dopaminergic system.</a>

00:50:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h50m42s">And that's pretty much what people run on.</a>
00:50:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h50m44s">And you can think about that as hope.</a>
00:50:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h50m46s">So incentive reward is sort of like hope,
or promise.</a>
00:50:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h50m49s">I think promise is a better term.</a>
00:50:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h50m52s">So there's pain and satiation, and those are
really ancient systems.</a>
00:50:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h50m57s">And then there are newer systems that are
anxiety and promise.</a>
00:50:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h51m05s">And those are related to those more fundamental
negative and positive emotions.</a>
00:51:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h51m10s">And those things regulate you while you're
on your path.</a>
00:51:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h51m13s">Now, there's one more level of complication,
because you think, well what can happen on</a>
00:51:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h51m18s">the way to your goal.</a>
00:51:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h51m20s">Nothing?</a>
00:51:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h51m21s">Irrelevant.</a>
00:51:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h51m22s">Okay, so that's the irrelevance that enables
you to not see the gorilla.</a>
00:51:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h51m28s">And almost everything around you is irrelevant.</a>
00:51:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h51m31s">And I think that's partly why I think people
don't like to have their little maps of the</a>
00:51:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h51m34s">world destroyed.</a>
00:51:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h51m36s">Because if your map of the world is thoroughly
demolished everything becomes relevant.</a>
00:51:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h51m41s">And you do not want everything to become relevant.</a>
00:51:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h51m44s">It's just too much for you.</a>
00:51:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h51m46s">So you wake up and you're naked and it's dark
in the middle of a jungle.</a>
00:51:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h51m50s">It's like, everything's relevant!</a>
00:51:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h51m51s">You're not going to like that.</a>
00:51:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h51m54s">It's going to burn you out quick.</a>
00:51:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h51m55s">And so most of the time you have to be protected
so that almost everything's irrelevant.</a>
00:51:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h52m01s">And then you can focus on the few things that
you're capable of handling, and you do that.</a>
00:52:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h52m06s">So you're in your little map, and then as
you move towards it your emotions play.</a>
00:52:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h52m11s">And the negative emotions appear when things
are not going well and the positive emotions</a>
00:52:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h52m15s">appear when things are going well.</a>
00:52:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h52m17s">That's basically how your emotions work.</a>
00:52:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h52m20s">Now, you've got your satiation and your pain.</a>
00:52:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h52m24s">Then you've got your threat and your promise.</a>
00:52:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h52m28s">Then on top of that you've got a more complicated
thing which is novelty, because that's the</a>
00:52:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h52m31s">other thing that can happen when you're on
the way from point A to point B. Something</a>
00:52:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h52m37s">you didn't expect--and you don't understand.</a>
00:52:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h52m42s">So</a>
00:52:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h52m54s">you're walking down the street and there's
someone laying there face-down on the sidewalk.</a>
00:52:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h53m02s">And you know, they're dishevelled, and so
well, what's your emotional response?</a>
00:53:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h53m08s">Well you didn't expect it, so you're going
to be taken aback a bit: that's anxiety.</a>
00:53:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h53m13s">It's like, you're moving towards your goal
and anxiety stops you.</a>
00:53:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h53m17s">Now you can think of the space-time area around
that person as unexplored territory.</a>
00:53:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h53m25s">Now you don't want any unexplored territory
in your map because god only knows what's</a>
00:53:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h53m28s">going to happen there.</a>
00:53:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h53m30s">So what're you supposed to do?</a>
00:53:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h53m33s">Well maybe you cross the street--you think
well that person's drunk or maybe you think,</a>
00:53:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h53m36s">well they're a homeless person.</a>
00:53:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h53m38s">Maybe they're lying on a sleeping back--you
think they're just asleep.</a>
00:53:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h53m41s">You're going to stop and then you're going
to observe, and then you're going to use little</a>
00:53:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h53m46s">cues to try to put your map back together.</a>
00:53:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h53m47s">And your map is, what’s going on here and
what should I do about it?</a>
00:53:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h53m51s">And so, it's partly this interplay between
anxiety and curiosity.</a>
00:53:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h53m54s">Now you can just step around it and continue,
but maybe that'll upset your moral map--what</a>
00:53:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h53m59s">kind of person am I?</a>
00:53:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h54m00s">Maybe I should have done something about it.</a>
00:54:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h54m02s">Or maybe you think, there's no damn way I'm
going to get involved in this because, who</a>
00:54:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h54m07s">knows what'll happen if I step in there.</a>
00:54:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h54m09s">And you know, fair enough, because, who knows
what'll happen if you step in there.</a>
00:54:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h54m14s">The point is that, it's like your map which
has made everything irrelevant has got a hole</a>
00:54:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h54m21s">in it and now some of what's complicated is
shining through.</a>
00:54:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h54m25s">And that thing that's shining through--so
that's like what the phenomenologists talked</a>
00:54:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h54m28s">about as shining forth--that thing that's
shining through, it's like you don't know</a>
00:54:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h54m33s">what to do about it.</a>
00:54:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h54m34s">What should you do?</a>
00:54:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h54m36s">Well, you should do what you do do, and what
you do is, you prepare to do everything.</a>
00:54:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h54m42s">And that's an emotional response to novelty.</a>
00:54:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h54m45s">Well, if you don't know what to do you should
prepare yourself for anything.</a>
00:54:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h54m50s">And that's stress.</a>
00:54:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h54m52s">You could prepare that something good will
happen.</a>
00:54:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNxlEQSvh_w#t=00h54m55s">Let’s say you're in an ambivalent.</a>
