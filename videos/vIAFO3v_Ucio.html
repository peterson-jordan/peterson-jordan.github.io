					<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h00m00s">I began to watch closely what I was saying.</a>
00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h00m04s">I don't know if it was intentional or not.</a>
00:00:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h00m07s">But I felt a crack growing in my mind and soul.</a>
00:00:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h00m11s">Some of my students told me that the same thing happened to them yet</a>
00:00:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h00m16s">They listen to some of the materials I explained to you.</a>
00:00:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h00m22s">Divided into two parts,</a>
00:00:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h00m24s">Let's say ... the part I was old was the most talkative</a>
00:00:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h00m32s">And he liked arguments and ideas, and another part watched the first with open eyes</a>
00:00:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h00m40s">He shall be judged impartially. The latter was watching the first one and saying, "That's not your idea."</a>
00:00:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h00m49s">"You don't really think so."</a>
00:00:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h00m51s">"You don't really know what you're saying"</a>
00:00:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h00m54s">"That is not true."</a>
00:00:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h00m55s">And I found that very interesting. As that happens</a>
00:00:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h00m59s">With 95 percent of what I'm saying, I didn't know what to do. I said well, that's weird. Perhaps</a>
00:00:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h01m05s">Broken, and that's not a good thing. I didn't hear noises or the like.</a>
00:01:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h01m10s">I mean, it wasn't like that.</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h01m12s">It was ... well, people have several parts.</a>
00:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h01m17s">I was in the process of a strange mystery. Which of these two things is me? Is it the part that listens and then says:</a>
00:01:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h01m25s">"No, this is nonsense." "this is a lie". "This..."</a>
00:01:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h01m29s">"You do it to like people," "You just want to win the argument."</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h01m33s">Whether that was me or the part that was released on</a>
00:01:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h01m37s">My usual verbal affair? And I didn't know. But I decided to choose the critic.</a>
00:01:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h01m42s">What I tried and learned to do, I suppose,</a>
00:01:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h01m45s">Is to stop saying the things that made me weak.</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h01m49s">And I still try to do that, because I always have</a>
00:01:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h01m53s">I feel as I speak,</a>
00:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h01m55s">Whether what I'm saying makes me consistent or divided</a>
00:01:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h02m01s">Think consistency</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h02m04s">It's the perfect way to visualize it, as I think you're when you say things</a>
00:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h02m10s">Correct as much as you can, they come</a>
00:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h02m15s">From deep inside, because we don't know the source of the ideas. We don't know how deep</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h02m20s">Ideas are born in our internal structure. We don't know of any operations</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h02m25s">Physiological consistency is needed in order to speak from your core. We don't understand any of that.</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h02m31s">We don't even imagine it, but I believe you can feel it, and I've learned some of that from my reading of Karl Rogers.</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h02m36s">Great clinician, he spoke of mental health as being partly connected</a>
00:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h02m42s">Between the spiritual or the abstract, and between the materialist. And that the two are consistent. And there are many</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h02m49s">On consistency in clinical and psychological psychological thought. After all, I decided to start</a>
00:02:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h02m56s">Practice not saying things that make me weak. And what happened is that I</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h03m00s">I had to stop saying</a>
00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h03m02s">Almost everything than I would say. 95 percent, I estimate</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h03m08s">Over a few months,</a>
00:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h03m10s">It was such a shock, to wake up and realize that you were almost a dead branch!</a>
00:03:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h03m15s">It's shocking! You might ask, "Do you really want all of that to fade away?"</a>
00:03:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h03m20s">There is only 5% of you left.</a>
00:03:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h03m23s">If that 5% ... is well established,</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h03m28s">So maybe that is exactly what you want to happen</a>
00:03:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h03m31s">I told you that this story is a detail of the verse: “And the Lord saw that the evil of man had increased on the earth,</a>
00:03:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h03m37s">And that every perception of the thoughts of his heart is only evil every day. "</a>
00:03:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h03m42s">A question worth answering:</a>
00:03:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h03m44s">"What are your motivations exactly?"</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h03m47s">Perhaps it is purer than my impulses, and that is certainly possible.</a>
00:03:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h03m51s">I don't think I'm a good person, particularly, by nature.</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h03m55s">I think I have to work on this with a lot of effort, and I don't think all people are necessarily like that</a>
00:03:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h04m02s">But some people are worse than that, and everyone is to some extent.</a>
00:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h04m08s">So it's worth thinking about.</a>
00:04:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h04m11s">Exactly, how much trouble do you want to cause?</a>
00:04:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h04m14s">And you may also think, if you do not do anything important in your life, according to your own definition,</a>
00:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h04m20s">- This is the game we're playing - you set the rules, at least in the beginning.</a>
00:04:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h04m25s">Perhaps you are inclined to cause trouble just because you are not good at it.</a>
00:04:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h04m29s">Because trouble is at least more exciting than boredom! That's what you learn if you read Dostoyovsky.</a>
00:04:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h04m35s">Dostoyovsky knew this very well.</a>
00:04:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h04m38s">So if you're not doing anything. If you don't push yourself within your energies</a>
00:04:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h04m42s">You will still have a lot</a>
00:04:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h04m45s">Of the will, energy, and resources to dedicate to causing trouble.</a>
00:04:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h04m53s">Also, I see this as a classic scenario.</a>
00:04:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h04m56s">"And the Lord saw that the evil of man had abounded on the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil every day."</a>
00:04:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h05m03s">That is something worth pondering.</a>
00:05:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h05m06s">This is not self-destructive</a>
00:05:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h05m08s">Because it's actually an attempt ... it's like diagnosing a disease</a>
00:05:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h05m12s">If it happened that applies to you to some extent</a>
00:05:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h05m15s">Maybe 10% of you, or maybe 90%.</a>
00:05:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h05m19s">So, your acceptance of it is excellent, because then you may stop doing it.</a>
00:05:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h05m24s">What's the downside about that?</a>
00:05:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h05m27s">You have to let go of your resentment, of course, your hate and all that.</a>
00:05:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h05m30s">And it's really annoying, because these emotions are so easy to manage.</a>
00:05:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h05m35s">It is enjoyable, and it has a feeling of pride that comes with it.</a>
00:05:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h05m41s">But,</a>
00:05:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h05m43s">You don't do it to harden yourself with criticism,</a>
00:05:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFO3v_Ucio#t=00h05m46s">But to distinguish the chaff from the fat, and leave all the money you do not want to be behind.</a>
