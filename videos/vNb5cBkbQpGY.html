<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h10m46s">Equivalent to be the answer that always is well it depends on how you define a and it depends on how you define b</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h10m52s">So generally it's not a very useful question, but you can still get the point that there's something very real about abstraction</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h32m10s">But it's been remarkably stable as far as I can tell in some sense</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h32m38s">Overarching picture of brain function, and so he did that partly by looking at its function</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h32m48s">And so we'll go through a brief picture of how the brain works and so one of the ways of so</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h32m55s">You can you can look at the brain from front to back and you can divide it roughly into two?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h32m59s">Sections in one section has to do with sensory processing and that's roughly the back half and one section has to do with motor</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h33m09s">Differentiated as you might think because you there's very little sensation without motor output. Maybe the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h33m16s">The part that closest to an exception is smell I would say but you at least have to breathe in</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h33m20s">You know and when an animal is actively searching on a scent trail its breathing in so it's using its motor output</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h47m28s">quarter of your motor output system is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h47m31s">devoted to tongue manipulation, right and so here's a</a>
00:47:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h47m36s">Here's a picture of the homunculus, this is a motor homunculus</a>
00:47:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h47m40s">So that's how that's what your brain thinks of your body that that's a good way of thinking about it</a>
00:47:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h47m44s">And so that's what a human being is like in terms of his or her</a>
00:47:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h47m47s">Output and so what you see if you look at a sensory homunculus, it's quite similar except the feet are bigger the genitalia are bigger</a>
00:47:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h47m55s">Logically they don't have much motor utility but they have a lot of sensory utility, but the rest of its quite similar</a>
00:47:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h48m01s">So there's you know the motor and the sensory homunculus are quite similar</a>
00:48:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h48m04s">But I'm going to talk about the motor homunculus because it's sort of the action</a>
00:48:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h48m08s">Representation well so what are human beings like?</a>
00:48:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h48m13s">We're all hands that's the first thing you know and if you do that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h48m18s">There's no, it's unbelievably high resolution your fingertips and and and the and the that sensory</a>
00:48:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h48m24s">But we can manipulate our hands like crazy like they're unbelievably articulated, right?</a>
00:48:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h48m29s">And that's the thing that makes us able to change the world it makes us</a>
00:48:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h48m32s">What dolphins aren't and so a huge part of our brain is devoted?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h48m37s">Towards being able to move our hands that enables us to take things apart put them together</a>
00:48:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h48m42s">And then once we learn to take things apart and put them together</a>
00:48:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h48m45s">We can talk about how we do that</a>
00:48:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h48m47s">And that's a lot of what we're doing and that's the hands and the mouth and the tongue Roughly speaking</a>
00:48:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h48m52s">Here's how I took something to get apart</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h49m15s">You can do the same thing. Yeah</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h49m17s">And that's you know it might be simple like this is how you pick up a rock?</a>
00:49:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h49m20s">But it might be complicated like here's how you go after the dragon of Chaos</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=00h49m25s">Right and so that's it sort of maps on to that hierarchy this thing</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=01h27m28s">Luria if I remember correctly all went to the same conference back in the early 1920s</a>
01:27:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=01h27m34s">Mid 1920s and heard Norbert Wiener speak so that's how cybernetics theory got built into some of these underlying</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=01h27m41s">Theories and sort of manifested itself everywhere so Gray</a>
01:27:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=01h27m44s">Gray uses a model very much like this derived from cybernetic theory and so here's the idea</a>
01:27:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=01h27m49s">How does the brain work you have a target in mind?</a>
01:27:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=01h27m53s">and you act to</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=01h27m55s">to manifest the target you act to transform the world into the target and</a>
01:27:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=01h27m59s">Then you compare the consequence of your actions to the target and if they matched and that's a good thing and if they don't match</a>
01:27:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=01h28m05s">Then that's what where negative emotion comes from. Okay,</a>
01:28:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=01h28m08s">So how does that work the hippocampus seems to be central to that, so it detects Mismatch so so in the classic</a>
01:28:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=01h28m15s">Behavioral theory, so this would be Gray's theory you have your expectations of the world that would be your model</a>
01:28:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=01h28m22s">And you have your sensory input which is the real world and then the hippocampus is mapping one on to the other</a>
01:28:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=01h28m29s">One from a top-down stream one from the bottom up stream and saying Match Match Match match</a>
01:28:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=01h28m35s">And as long as everything matches then the hippocampus (this is an oversimplification) keeps the subcortical</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h05m13s">There's</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h05m25s">Why the wings I don't know exactly why the wings I mean he's obviously being assimilated to the idea of a bird</a>
02:05:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h05m31s">I don't know if the idea of the far-seeing capacity of the bird was there for the mesopotamians highly probable</a>

02:05:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h05m47s">So so there's a very primordial representation of the same thing look how much imagination does it take to see</a>
02:05:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h05m55s">That that's the story of human beings encountering the unknown</a>

02:06:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h06m04s">well there is he's got his bow and arrow you know and he's out there fighting the monsters of the unknown and that's</a>
02:06:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h06m09s">Part that how human beings have survived yeah, yeah, that's and then here</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h06m22s">Okay, so let me just think for a minute you'll figure out what I want to do next if I want to go somewhere next</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h06m27s">I guess what I'll do right. Now is I'll just show you some additional pictures</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h06m30s">So we've laid out the conceptual world to some degree, right?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h07m03s">Positive and negative as well. That's the that's the entire story roughly speaking, and I showed you its manifestations and figures like this</a>
02:07:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h07m12s">So you have this is called the open virgin</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h08m34s">There's an example in the story of Exodus when Moses is leading the Israelites through the desert</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h08m40s">They fragment because while they're out of tyranny so they don't know what to do. It's all chaotic, and you know this Moses character</a>
02:08:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h08m47s">Yeah, you got them out of Egypt but now</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h08m49s">They're in the desert</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h08m49s">And there's nothing to eat and like why should they listen to him and so they start worshipping all sorts of idols and that's kind</a>
02:08:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h08m56s">Of like the fragmentation of what holds them centrally together and so what does God do he's not very happy about that</a>
02:08:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h09m02s">Whoo so he sends a bunch of poisonous snakes into the desert to bite them all</a>
02:09:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h09m07s">He thinks enough of these people. And that's chaos returning right in the form of these poisonous snakes and so</a>
02:09:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h09m13s">The Israelites are kind of sick and tired of being bitten by poisonous snakes so they go back to Moses</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h09m18s">And they say well, you know I know we've wandered off the path here</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h09m23s">but you know maybe who could have a little chat with God and see what he could do about these poisonous snakes and so so</a>
02:09:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h09m29s">Moses entreats God to do something about the snakes and what God tells people to do the strangest thing he says</a>

02:09:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h09m41s">Have everyone look at it. And everyone who goes to look at the snake won't be bitten by the poisonous snakes anymore</a>
02:09:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h09m46s">I just saw this it's it just</a>
02:09:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h09m51s">Crazy that idea. It's crazy so and I'll tell you something else else. That's very interesting so in that in the Christian story</a>
02:09:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h09m58s">Christ assimilates himself to that snake that was put on the post in the desert says exactly the same thing that</a>
02:09:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h10m05s">That that has to be looked at because that's the pathway to salvation</a>
02:10:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h10m10s">Roughly speaking. It's exactly the same idea. It's the worst thing that can possibly happen</a>
02:10:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h10m15s">So you look upon it and meditate upon it, and that's the key to transcending it well</a>
02:10:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h10m20s">So that's the idea that's encapsulated in that image</a>
02:10:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h10m23s">So it's you know. It's no wonder that these ideas had to be expressed in images because they're so unbelievably</a>
02:10:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h10m30s">Complicated that they're almost incomprehensible</a>
02:10:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h10m33s">So they come out first in the image they come out first in the story because they're just and plus</a>
02:10:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h10m38s">They're so difficult to believe</a>
02:10:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h10m40s">What the last thing you would think if you were being bitten by poisonous snakes was that you should make a bronze image of one</a>
02:10:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h10m46s">And put it on a stick so that you could go look at it</a>
02:10:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h10m48s">I mean, there's a magical element to that, but it's psycho therapeutically</a>
02:10:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h10m53s">exactly, right</a>
02:10:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h10m54s">so I had this client and</a>
02:10:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h10m56s">She had a dream about what what she was she was having a really rough time, and she she was a pretty good dreamer.</a>
02:10:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h11m02s">She had this dream that she was walking down a road by there was a ocean on one side</a>
02:11:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h11m07s">and there was a sort of sand dunes on the other side and</a>
02:11:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h11m10s">She looked up, and there's this guy with a huge python</a>
02:11:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h11m14s">that had that had been out there showing it to everyone and</a>
02:11:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h11m18s">she took a look and he invited her to come take a look at the snake, but she refused and walked on and</a>
02:11:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h11m24s">So she told me that dream. She was also quite imaginative, so I said look let's let's try something</a>
02:11:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h11m31s">First of all tell me about the snake handler, and she said well. He's kind of a Charlatan. He's a show-off</a>
02:11:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h11m37s">he's a he's a fake and I'm afraid that if I went up to the crowd and</a>
02:11:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h11m42s">Where the snake was that they would force me to touch it and so I thought okay?</a>
02:11:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h11m46s">So that's why you walked by I said okay, so let's play a game. So you</a>
02:11:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h11m50s">Sit there and bring that dream image to mind close your eyes bring the dream image to mind</a>
02:11:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h11m54s">But let's play with a little bit like Jung's technique of active imagination. Let's play with it a little bit so go up</a>
02:11:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h12m00s">There you know imagine that you go up there, and you kind of have to do this like you're daydreaming</a>
02:12:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h12m05s">You know you can't force it. You have to play with it like you would when you're daydreaming</a>
02:12:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h12m09s">Which is you're kind of half doing it voluntarily and it's half</a>
02:12:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h12m13s">Manifesting itself. It's kind of a gateway between you and the collective unconscious. That's another way of thinking about it and</a>
02:12:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h12m20s">Anyways, I said okay, so go up there and the first thing we're going to do is figure out</a>
02:12:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h12m24s">What are you going to do if the crowd tells you that you have to touch the snake or get close to it?</a>
02:12:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h12m29s">Because she needed a defense because it isn't up to other people to force her to do that</a>
02:12:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h12m33s">So we we practiced what she might say like no, I'm I'm comfortable here</a>
02:12:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h12m37s">I'm just going to stand in the background. Just going to look at it and get accustomed to it</a>
02:12:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h12m40s">I don't need you to push me forward so she felt pretty good about that</a>
02:12:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h12m43s">So I kind of armed her with a defense</a>
02:12:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h12m45s">so then she could</a>
02:12:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h12m46s">Pretend to go up and take a look at the snake and I said well the first thing</a>
02:12:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h12m49s">You should do is take a look at the snake handler and see if he's who you think he is and so she did that?</a>
02:12:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h12m55s">In her imagination she said no, he doesn't seem to be the Charlatan at all</a>
02:12:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h12m58s">He's got this snake that is his you know something he takes care of and he just has come out here to show</a>
02:12:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h13m04s">The people and let people look at the snake and so she said yes</a>
02:13:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h13m08s">I said was he someone that you could trust or someone you shouldn't trust you have to ask both those questions because otherwise you're leading</a>
02:13:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h13m16s">Witness right you don't want to tell people what to think you have to let them figure it out for themselves</a>
02:13:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h13m21s">So and she said no, I think he's somebody that should be trusted, and I said, okay well</a>
02:13:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h13m26s">what do you think that you could go up there and and and you know maybe lay your hands on the snake and touch the</a>
02:13:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h13m31s">Snake and she said she wasn't sure about it, but we went through it and she was able to do it and so</a>
02:13:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h13m36s">It's the same</a>
02:13:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h13m38s">So she had to she had to make contact she had to voluntarily make</a>
02:13:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h13m42s">Contact with with the this terrible snake that's at the bottom of being that's at the bottom of the tree of existence</a>
02:13:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h13m49s">Right that's where the snake is it's wrapped around the tree</a>
02:13:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h13m52s">Well, why well partly because we lived in trees, and that's where the damn snakes were down there on the ground where we didn't know</a>
02:13:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h13m59s">Right and that's the divine tree of being that and so</a>
02:13:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h14m03s">Well you have to get the hell out of the tree and go</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb5cBkbQpGY#t=02h14m06s">Confront the snakes and then that's the that's the way out at least in principle. So that's kind of what that means</a>
