<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h01m39s">So you think, 'What are you doing about that?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h01m42s">Well accept it, that's what life is, it's suffering</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h01m52s">So, who wants to admit that? Well, just think about it, so what do you do in the face of that suffering</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h01m59s">Try to limit it</a>

00:02:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h02m23s">.. you get hold of yourself, and maybe if you catch yourself after that you know how to do it</a>
00:02:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h02m27s">You know what's wrong with you, if you have to admit it</a>
00:02:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h02m30s">You know, there are a few things you can improve a little bit</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h02m33s">You might even be able to sort out your current imperfect situation</a>
00:02:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h02m37s">So maybe you make yourself shine a little, and then your eyes will open a little</a>
00:02:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h02m42s">Then you can make yourself shine more and then maybe you can reunite your family</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h02m46s">Instead of being the embryo of hate, hatred and gang rivalry, which is doomed to spend Christmas with them</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h02m57s">So when you fix yourself a little, with a kind of humility because ... you know, oh my God, that you are a "reformer and reformer" if there is such a thing</a>
00:02:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h03m04s">Then you have to find a way to solve ... well</a>
00:03:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h03m06s">Can you find a way to come to terms with your stupid brother, and from the reference no because it is as stupid as you are</a>
00:03:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h03m11s">So how the hell are you going to handle that</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h03m13s">So then maybe you get to something and your family somehow starts to play their role</a>
00:03:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h03m17s">And you discover, "Well ... that kind of removed a little bit of suffering" even though it reduced the chances of a malevolent revenge.</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h03m23s">And this kind of annoying pain, so then you gather your family together a little</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h03m28s">And you get along a little, at least a little bit because you did something difficult</a>
00:03:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h03m33s">Which is actually difficult, you are wiser</a>
00:03:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h03m36s">So maybe you can try and try far outside the family and try to change some little things without ruining it</a>
00:03:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h03m42s">Our society is complex, and we teach our students that they can simply fix it</a>
00:03:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h03m47s">It's like, 'Go fix an army helicopter and see where you get to that</a>
00:03:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h03m52s">It's like ... you'd behave like a chimpanzee with a big screwdriver. Look, it's better</a>
00:03:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h03m57s">The answer is no ... it is not better, things are complicated and fixing things is very difficult</a>
00:03:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h04m03s">And you have to act as a golden tool to fix things</a>
00:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h04m07s">And you are not</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h04m09s">So this is another message from the West</a>
00:04:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h04m13s">It is like: How can you overcome life's suffering?</a>
00:04:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h04m16s">And I'm not saying it's just the West's message</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h04m19s">How to overcome the suffering of life? Be a better person</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h04m24s">That's how you do it. Well, that's tough</a>
00:04:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h04m27s">It requires responsibility. And I think if you told someone you want a meaningful life?</a>
00:04:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h04m34s">Everything you do makes a difference</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h04m35s">This is the definition of meaningful life, everything you do makes a difference</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h04m40s">You should carry that with you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h04m43s">Or do you want to completely forget about the topic of meaning</a>
00:04:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h04m46s">Then you have no responsibility, because who might matter? You can roam life, doing what you want</a>
00:04:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h04m52s">Satisfying reckless desires, for what may be useful</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h04m56s">And stuck in meaninglessness but without having any responsibilities, which one do you want?</a>
00:04:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h05m01s">Well, ask yourself which one are you looking for?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h05m05s">And you will quickly find that it is not the majority of your soul that pursues every object of meaning because .. see what it must do to do so</a>
00:05:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h05m14s">You have to take in the fact that life is suffering and you have to cope with it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLvd_ZbX1w0#t=00h05m21s">Well that's hard, it's amazing how people can even do it</a>
