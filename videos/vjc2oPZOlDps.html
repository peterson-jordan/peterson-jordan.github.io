00:00:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h00m25s">And this really hit me, because I was interested particularly</a>
00:00:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h00m29s">in what was happening in the Nazi camps with the guards.</a>
00:00:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h00m33s">Because the guards were gratuitously cruel.</a>
00:00:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h00m36s">And I was very curious about that.</a>
00:00:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h00m38s">So, here's an interesting story. This was in a book called 'Ordinary Germans: Hitler's Willing Executioners.'</a>
00:00:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h00m44s">And it was a book that was written about thirty years ago</a>
00:00:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h00m47s">that challenged the idea that the Nazi phenomena was top down order following.</a>
00:00:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h00m51s">Which I don't believe, by the way.</a>
00:00:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h00m53s">I think that that's a very weak hypothesis.</a>
00:00:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h00m57s">Fascistic societies are fascistic in every single level of organization.</a>
00:00:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h01m01s">Spiritually, within the family, within the local community.</a>
00:01:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h01m05s">It's like a holograph. It's the same absolutely everywhere.</a>
00:01:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h01m07s">It's not top down. I mean, there are leaders who get produced, and maybe they catalyze it.</a>
00:01:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h01m11s">But to blame it on the leaders is to forget about the process by which the leaders come to be.</a>
00:01:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h01m17s">So, no, you don't get a pass that way.</a>
00:01:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h01m20s">So here's one of the things that happened.</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h01m24s">As the Nazis started to lose the war...</a>
00:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h01m27s">So, here's what you should have done if you were a Nazi</a>
00:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h01m29s">and wanted to win the war.</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h01m30s">You should have enslaved the Jews and the Gypsies, and had them work. Right?</a>
00:01:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h01m34s">You should have had them work for the benefit of the victory.</a>
00:01:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h01m38s">And then, if you wanted to, you liquidate them afterwards.</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h01m40s">That's the logical thing to do if you want to win.</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h01m43s">And we assume that Hitler wanted to win.</a>
00:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h01m45s">But that's not a very intelligent assumption.</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h01m48s">Why would you assume that? He wasn't exactly a good guy.</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h01m51s">So, why should we assume that he was aiming at the good that he was promoting</a>
00:01:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h01m55s">even in his own terms?</a>
00:01:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h01m56s">Right, the glorious, everlasting Third Reich. Right? That would rule for a thousand years</a>
00:01:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h02m02s">and be a bastion of civilization and music,</a>
00:02:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h02m05s">because that's the sort of thing that he purported to be interested in.</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h02m07s">Well, so what do you do with the Jews and the Gypsies?</a>
00:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h02m10s">Well, round them up, fine. Enslave them, fine. You don't kill them.</a>
00:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h02m14s">You certainly don't devote a substantial proportion of your war resources,</a>
00:02:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h02m19s">while you're losing, to accelerate the rate at which the extermination is taking place.</a>
00:02:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h02m24s">Because that's a bit counterproductive.</a>
00:02:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h02m26s">Unless what you're aiming at is the maximum possible mayhem in the shortest period of time.</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h02m30s">Well, so what happened as the Germans started to lose the war?</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h02m34s">Did Hitler lose faith in his own ability?</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h02m36s">No, he believed that the Germans had betrayed him with weakness,</a>
00:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h02m39s">and so he was perfectly willing to accelerate the rate at which Germany was losing the war.</a>
00:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h02m44s">And so, when Hitler and his minions had the choice, here's the choice:</a>
00:02:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h02m48s">You can suspend your unnecessary demolition of people, win the damn war,</a>
00:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h02m53s">and then pick it up afterwards.</a>
00:02:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h02m55s">Or, while you're losing, you could just accelerate the mayhem, even though it's counterproductive.</a>
00:02:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h02m59s">It's like, what did they pick? Well, they picked to accelerate the mayhem.</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h03m04s">So, to me, there's an old psychoanalytic idea -- I think this was derived by Jung --</a>
00:03:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h03m08s">If you can't figure out what someone's doing, or why,</a>
00:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h03m12s">look at the outcome. And infer the motivation.</a>
00:03:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h03m17s">If it produces mayhem, perhaps it was aiming at mayhem.</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h03m22s">Now, you know, you have to use that dictum carefully.</a>
00:03:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h03m25s">If someone's irritating you, you know, maybe it's because you're irritable and you should sort yourself out. ;)</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h03m29s">But maybe it's because they're actually aiming at irritating you.</a>
00:03:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h03m33s">And that's the actual motivation. So, perhaps not, but it's another tool in your analytical armament.</a>
00:03:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h03m40s">So... And so, you see, well, this is the thing about warfare that's so interesting.</a>
00:03:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h03m47s">About... about... Because you can attribute it to territoriality.</a>
00:03:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h03m50s">You can attribute it to a war for resources,</a>
00:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h03m53s">that's what the, I would say, wretchedly simpleminded economists presume.</a>
00:03:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h04m02s">People fight over scarce resources.</a>
00:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h04m05s">It's like, hey, we're a little bit more sophisticated than that.</a>
00:04:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h04m08s">And, first of all, what resources are we talking about?</a>
00:04:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h04m11s">The bloody Inuit had nothing. They lived perfectly well.</a>
00:04:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h04m14s">What did they have? Snow and seal blubber.</a>
00:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h04m16s">You know, people can live in unbelievably deprived conditions.</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h04m20s">And so the idea that there are natural resources that we fight over</a>
00:04:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h04m24s">because there's a shortage of them is a pretty oversimplified view of human beings.</a>
00:04:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h04m28s">It's like, well, why do people fight?</a>
00:04:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h04m29s">Well, maybe they fight sometimes for good reasons.</a>
00:04:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h04m32s">But very, very frequently, they fight for bad reasons.</a>
00:04:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h04m35s">And those bad reasons are personal, as well as socio-cultural and economic.</a>
00:04:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h04m40s">You know, if you were a Nazi prison guard, for example,</a>
00:04:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h04m42s">whatever pathologies you were carrying around in your destructive little soul,</a>
00:04:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h04m46s">whatever element of Cain was deeply embedded in you,</a>
00:04:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h04m48s">had the opportunity to be manifest fully at every moment of your waking existence.</a>
00:04:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h04m53s">You had these people who were completely beholden to you,</a>
00:04:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h04m57s">with no rights whatsoever, to whom you could do</a>

00:04:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc2oPZOlDps#t=00h05m02s">And think, well, maybe that was the motivation for putting them there to begin with.</a>
