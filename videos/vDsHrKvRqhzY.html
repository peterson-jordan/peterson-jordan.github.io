					<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h00m00s">What is my advice to young men looking for a wife to marry and start a family with?</a>
00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h00m07s">Yes, ok, fine. A clear question.</a>
00:00:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h00m12s">What you cannot ignore is the requirement of mutual attraction.</a>
00:00:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h00m16s">This is important. And mysterious.</a>
00:00:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h00m20s">So for example, this is something crazy.</a>
00:00:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h00m24s">One of the things we know that attracts people to each other is a symmetrical face.</a>
00:00:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h00m27s">You can rate men for the degree of symmetry of their face.</a>
00:00:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h00m34s">Then you give the most and the least symmetrical men each a clean t-shirt to wear for a day.</a>
00:00:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h00m43s">Then have your women assess the shirt's scent for attractiveness.</a>
00:00:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h00m49s">The women will find the scent of the symmetrical men more attractive.</a>
00:00:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h00m56s">And there are other factors that determine sexual attraction that are based on biological factors.</a>
00:00:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h01m02s">They are deeply embedded in our nature, like smell.</a>
00:01:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h01m05s">Women also appear to be less attracted to the smell of men with a Rhesus factor that can cause problems in having children.</a>
00:01:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h01m21s">One reason women give for finding the scent of such men unattractive is that they smell too much like their brother.</a>
00:01:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h01m29s">Strange, mysterious things determine whether or not people are sexually and physically attracted to each other.</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h01m36s">I think this is an important part of a marriage relationship.</a>
00:01:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h01m40s">Almost as important is trust, man, there is no successful marriage without trust.</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h01m48s">You must be honest with each other.</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h01m51s">One of the reasons Carl Jung believed that marriage should be an oath and a covenant was very wise.</a>
00:01:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h01m59s">You know, being honest with someone isn't easy because there are many things about all of us that are awful, weak, repulsive, and shameful.</a>
00:01:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h02m09s">And these things need to be brought up and discussed.</a>
00:02:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h02m13s">But you're not going to tell the truth about yourself to someone who can run screaming when you reveal who you really are.</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h02m20s">So the marriage bond is like, Okay, here's the deal. I chain myself to you and you chain to me.</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h02m30s">And then we tell each other the truth and neither of us can run away.</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h02m34s">And then if we know everything, then we will mutually torture each other with it or we will try to face that truth and try to become better people.</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h02m42s">Together. And thus, we become more powerful and resilient and deeper and wiser as we go through life together.</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h02m53s">I think that's brilliant. Because if you leave a way out, man, you'll use it too, that's for sure.</a>
00:02:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h02m59s">The oath is here - and this was Jung's view of the spiritualization of the human pair bond.</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h03m06s">Christian marriage, for example, emphasized the, shall we say, submission of both marriage participants to a higher power as embodied in the Logos.</a>
00:03:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h03m23s">So the idea is that in a Christian marriage, for example, it is not the man or the woman who is boss, but the shared person consisting of seeking the truth in both of them.</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h03m38s">You can see this as their joint submission to the Logos.</a>
00:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h03m41s">And that's so true, man.</a>
00:03:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h03m44s">The measure of your married life should be your promise to tell each other the truth.</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h03m50s">Because at a difficult moment in your life, when you have done something incredibly stupid that could cost you your head, when there is no one to turn to ...</a>
00:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h03m58s">If you have a partner you can trust, then you can say, Hey, I made a big mistake with money, it keeps me awake, I feel so stupid and it can go completely wrong.</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h04m07s">This person will help you come up with a solution.</a>
00:04:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h04m11s">And he or she will know that when it is the other way around - and it will certainly happen - that you are there to talk to, and that you can work it out together.</a>
00:04:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h04m18s">This is important.</a>
00:04:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h04m21s">There are a few things in our culture that are completely wrong, one of which is the underestimation of marriage. That's a bad idea.</a>
00:04:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h04m27s">Your marriage is one third of your life, maybe more. And children, also a third.</a>
00:04:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h04m34s">The rest out here is also a third of the life, just about.</a>
00:04:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h04m42s">To miss any of that is a huge mistake.</a>
00:04:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h04m46s">That being said, there are also those who miss one or more because they have a good reason to.</a>
00:04:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h04m55s">Maybe they are insanely creative artists who have to devote themselves fully to their careers.</a>
00:04:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h05m00s">Or they excel in some way and can justify sacrificing part of the Trinity of Life for another part.</a>
00:05:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h05m08s">But in general that's very dangerous, and you shouldn't do it.</a>
00:05:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h05m13s">Children also get off badly, while they can be great fun if they behave well.</a>
00:05:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h05m20s">One of the chapters of my new book is called "Don't Let Your Children Do Anything That Will Make You Dislike Them."</a>
00:05:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h05m26s">You can, especially if you discuss it well with your partner, with the person helping you raise your children.</a>
00:05:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h05m33s">And children are the best company, because they are very enthusiastic about everything. They love new things.</a>
00:05:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h05m39s">They love you so they're happy when you get there.</a>
00:05:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h05m42s">You just have to make sure that they are neither too hot nor too cold, and that they have eaten and are not too tired.</a>
00:05:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h05m48s">And don't expect them to focus on anything longer than they can.</a>
00:05:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h05m54s">We took our children out to dinner when they were little, and they sat at the table when they were two and three years old with no problem and were fine.</a>
00:05:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h06m02s">But no longer than 45 minutes.</a>
00:06:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h06m04s">You shouldn't ask too much. But I have noticed that small children become restless and unreasonable about five to ten minutes earlier than adults.</a>
00:06:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h06m14s">Only they are too stupid to notice. Children notice immediately.</a>
00:06:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h06m17s">Okay, back to marriage.</a>
00:06:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h06m19s">You're looking for someone you find attractive, love, and someone you trust damn well.</a>
00:06:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h06m24s">And then you are honest with them.</a>
00:06:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h06m27s">And so maybe you can get through life and find someone with whom you can weave the rope of your being into a stronger rope of the two of you together.</a>
00:06:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h06m37s">So your story gets some continuity, and you can have children and then grandchildren.</a>
00:06:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h06m41s">And then you have a life, man.</a>
00:06:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h06m43s">It's such a privilege when you get that done, so that's it.</a>
00:06:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h06m50s">My answer to the question: What is your advice to young men looking for a wife to marry and have children? OK then.</a>
00:06:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h06m56s">Furthermore, marry someone you think would be a good mother and who has the sense to know she wants children too.</a>
00:06:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h07m03s">Some women don't want children. Fine. And some women may not be better off getting them. That is also possible.</a>
00:07:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h07m11s">But the rule of thumb is that a woman in her mid-20s who doesn't know - or won't admit - that she wants children unless she has an all-important reason for it,</a>
00:07:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h07m26s">she has not listed them psychologically.</a>
00:07:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h07m30s">She doesn't know what's important in life.</a>
00:07:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h07m34s">That can of course also apply to you. It probably is.</a>
00:07:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsHrKvRqhzY#t=00h07m36s">But it is a good rule of thumb.</a>
