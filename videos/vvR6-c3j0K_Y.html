					<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h00m00s">I've been telling people online, in various ways and in lectures, that they should start fixing up the world by cleaning up their room.</a>
00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h00m07s">And I wanted to just elaborate on that a little bit,
before I get back to the lecture itself.</a>
00:00:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h00m12s">So... as it has become weird Internet meme, you know.</a>
00:00:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h00m17s">And, and, and...</a>
00:00:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h00m20s">And it's a joke. And good, it's a joke!</a>
00:00:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h00m22s">I'm really happy about the fact, that so much of this has got like, the leaving of humor, and it's really important.</a>
00:00:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h00m28s">Because, that's what stops things from
degenerating into conflict - the humor.</a>
00:00:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h00m33s">And, I was thinking about this idea of cleaning up your room, in relationship to the Mustard Seed idea, and...</a>
00:00:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h00m38s">You see, the thing about cleaning up your room,</a>
00:00:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h00m41s">this is also something I learned from Carl Jung
and his "Studies on Alchemy",</a>
00:00:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h00m45s">because for Jung,</a>
00:00:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h00m47s">when the alchemist was attempting to make the Philosopher's Stone,</a>
00:00:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h00m49s">he was not only engaged in the transformation of the material world,
but he was engaged in the process of self-transformation;</a>
00:00:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h00m55s">that occurred at the same time,
as that the chemical transformation.</a>
00:00:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h01m01s">So it was a psychological work, in some sense.</a>
00:01:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h01m03s">Let's say you wanna sort out your room, and beautify it,
because the beauty is also important.</a>
00:01:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h01m08s">And let's say that all you have, is just a little room!
Like, you're not rich, you're poor.</a>
00:01:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h01m12s">And you don't have any power, that's another thing.
But you've got your damn room, and you've got this</a>
00:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h01m16s">space, right in front of you, you know, that's a part
of the Cosmos, that you can come to grips with.</a>
00:01:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h01m21s">And you might think - well, what's there in front of you, right in front of you?</a>
00:01:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h01m25s">And the answer to that, is:
it depends on how open your eyes are.</a>
00:01:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h01m28s">That's the proper answer,
because you could say,</a>
00:01:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h01m31s">and William Blake said this, for example.
Aldous Huxley made comments that were very similar,</a>
00:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h01m35s">that in a transcendent state,
you can see infinity in the finite.</a>
00:01:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h01m39s">And you might say-
And well, you can say- and-</a>
00:01:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h01m41s">You can see infinity in what you have
within your grasp, if you look!</a>
00:01:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h01m45s">And you could say, maybe that's the case with your room.</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h01m47s">And so, you wanna clean up your room.
Well okay, how do you do that, exactly?</a>
00:01:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h01m53s">Well, a room is...
a room is a place to sleep.</a>
00:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h01m56s">And so, if you set your room up properly, then you figure out how to sleep, and when you should sleep, and how you should sleep.</a>
00:01:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h02m01s">And then you figure out, when you should wake up.</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h02m03s">And then you figure out, well, what clothes you should wear.</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h02m05s">Because they have to be arranged properly in your dresser, and then you have to have some place to put your clothes.</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h02m10s">And if you're gonna have some clothes on, you have to
figure out, what you're gonna wear those clothes to do.</a>
00:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h02m13s">Right? And then, that means you have
to figure out what you're going to do!</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h02m16s">And then, your room has to serve that purpose!
Because otherwise it isn't set up properly.</a>
00:02:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h02m20s">And, if it doesn't set up-</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h02m22s">If it doesn't serve your purposes,
you will be unhappy and not happy in the room.</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h02m27s">Because the way that we perceive the world,
is as a place to move from point A to point B in.</a>
00:02:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h02m34s">And then, if the place that we're in facilitates
that movement, then we're happy to be there.</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h02m39s">And if a place that we're in, serves as an obstacle
to that movement, then we're unhappy to be there.</a>
00:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h02m45s">And so, what it means to "set up your room", is that
you have to have somewhere to go, that's worthwhile;</a>
00:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h02m50s">or you can't set up your room, and then
your room has to be set up to facilitate that!</a>
00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h02m54s">And then, the next thing is:
Well, maybe you have to make it beautiful?</a>
00:02:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h02m57s">But that's not easy, right?
That means you have to have some taste.</a>
00:02:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h03m00s">And that doesn't mean, you have to have money. It doesn't!</a>
00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h03m03s">Because, you can be garish with money,
and you can be tasteful with nothing!</a>
00:03:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h03m08s">All you need is taste! And taste beats money,
when it comes to beautifying things, you know.</a>
00:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h03m12s">I mean, not that money is trivial,
because it's not - but taste is crucial!</a>
00:03:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h03m15s">And people, who are very artistically oriented,
can make beautiful things out of virtually nothing.</a>
00:03:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h03m21s">And not only that! The literature suggests,
that if you're going to make beautiful things,</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h03m25s">putting real constraints on what you allow yourself to do,
facilitates creativity, instead of interfering with it!</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h03m32s">Because let's say, you have to make
something out of nothing, right?</a>
00:03:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h03m35s">Which I suppose would be a godly act, right?</a>
00:03:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h03m38s">You have to make Something out of Nothing,
you have to be creative in order to do that!</a>
00:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h03m41s">And so then, to beautify your room,</a>
00:03:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h03m45s">means that you also have to develop your capacity to be creative!</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h03m48s">And so, then you can make your room... sh- shine!</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h03m52s">But then what will happen, is that if your family
isn't together, they will interfere with that.</a>
00:03:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h03m56s">You'll interfere with that, because you won't have the discipline to do it properly.</a>
00:03:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h04m00s">But then, when you start building this little
microcosm of perfection, with what you have at hand,</a>
00:04:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h04m06s">then it'll evoke all the pathologies of everyone in your household!</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h04m10s">They'll wonder, what the hell you're up to in there,
and they won't necessarily be happy.</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h04m13s">Because, if you're...</a>
00:04:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h04m15s">If they're in a lowly place, let's say, and so are you,
and you're trying to move out of that,</a>
00:04:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h04m19s">then the higher you move out of that,
the more the place they're in, looks bad!</a>
00:04:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h04m24s">And you might say: "Well, what they should do,
is celebrate your victory over Chaos and Evil!"</a>
00:04:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h04m28s">But that isn't what will happen! What will happen instead,
is that they will attempt to pull you back down.</a>
00:04:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h04m33s">They'll attempt to... and, I mean obviously, all families don't do that,</a>
00:04:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h04m36s">but all families do that to some degree,
and some families do almost nothing but that.</a>
00:04:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h04m43s">And so, what that means, is that
if you're going to organize your room,</a>
00:04:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h04m47s">then you're going to have to confront the devils in your house,</a>
00:04:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h04m49s">and that's often...
that's often a terrifying thing, because</a>
00:04:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h04m52s">some of those devils have lineages, that
go back many, many, many generations!</a>
00:04:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h04m58s">And God only knows what you have to struggle with, in order to overcome that!</a>
00:04:58</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h05m03s">And so, to sort yourself out and to fix up your room,
is a non-trivial matter, you know!</a>
00:05:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h05m08s">And you can do that - you'll learn by doing that,</a>
00:05:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h05m11s">and then, maybe you'll learn enough by doing that,
so that you can fix up your family a little bit,</a>
00:05:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h05m15s">and then, having done that, you'll have enough character,</a>
00:05:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h05m18s">so that when you try to operate in the world,
at your job, or maybe in the broader social spheres,</a>
00:05:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h05m23s">that you'll be a force for good instead of harm!
Because you'll have learned some humility,</a>
00:05:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h05m28s">by noting, just how difficult it was,
to put your damn room together!</a>
00:05:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h05m31s">Well, and yourself, for that matter.</a>
00:05:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR6-c3j0K_Y#t=00h05m33s">And so, you'll proceed cautiously,
with your eyes open, towards the Good.</a>
