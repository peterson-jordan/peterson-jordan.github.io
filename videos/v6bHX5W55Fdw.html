<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHX5W55Fdw#t=00h08m51s">he'd go sit in a cave for about a decade, and eat</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHX5W55Fdw#t=00h09m27s">Because it's really the first story about human beings</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHX5W55Fdw#t=00h09m30s">that we have at the base of our culture. Because Adam and Eve were made by God,</a>

00:10:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHX5W55Fdw#t=00h10m10s">And Cain says: "my punishment is more than I can bear". And it might be because God has banished him.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHX5W55Fdw#t=00h11m15s">It's plenty bad. Even at the cost of his own soul, in some sense,</a>
