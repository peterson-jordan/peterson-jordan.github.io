00:00:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h00m22s">I'm doing great. So what what's great about what what you're doing? What's so good about your life?</a>
00:00:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h00m29s">Well right now I'm in the process of putting together my next stand-up comedy special</a>
00:00:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h00m36s">So I'm at the process now where I've actually put together a full new hour of material</a>
00:00:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h00m42s">since my Netflix special which came out in October so</a>
00:00:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h00m46s">That's that's great for me. It's that's always a</a>
00:00:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h00m49s">a relaxing moment because it's very difficult to put that hour together.</a>
00:00:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h00m53s">And so it's and so how do you go about doing that?</a>
00:00:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h00m56s">A lot of writing a lot of performing a lot of reading a lot of going over notes a lot of</a>
00:00:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h01m03s">examining material a lot of reviewing</a>
00:01:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h01m07s">Sets and trying to find out what I like and what I don't like it's a long and brutal process system</a>
00:01:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h01m13s">It's the most fun but also the most difficult part of stand-up is the creation of new material</a>
00:01:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h01m18s">So how many hours do you think you put in of work to do an hour's worth stand-up?</a>
00:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h01m24s">Any idea?</a>
00:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h01m24s">That's a really good question</a>
00:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h01m26s">It's usually about I can do I can create a solid ten minutes a month. That's usually what it is</a>
00:01:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h01m33s">So it takes me six months to do an hour and in that six months on an average week I'll do</a>
00:01:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h01m40s">Eight or nine sets so that's eight or nine</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h01m45s">either half-hour or hours of material</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h01m49s">Sometimes 15 minutes usually an hour depending upon where I'm working and how many other people are on the show</a>
00:01:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h01m55s">And then a lot of time writing</a>
00:01:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h01m59s">So you're doing those sets in front of live audiences all the time? Yes.</a>
00:01:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h02m02s">Yeah, you have to. Let's, that's the weird thing about stand-up comedy</a>
00:02:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h02m06s">It seems to be that it's it's not something that you can do in a vacuum</a>
00:02:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h02m11s">It has to actually be done. It actually it has to come alive in front of the audience</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h02m16s">Like I can I can write in a vacuum,</a>
00:02:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h02m18s">I can write alone, I can, uh</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h02m21s">contemplate, go over my material, review,</a>
00:02:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h02m25s">edit, I could all sorts of things by myself, but it really doesn't come alive until it's in front of an audience</a>
00:02:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h02m31s">Yeah, well, I guess it's not so easy to figure out what's funny</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h02m34s">You kind of hope that people will laugh</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h02m37s">yeah, it's that, but it's also there's a state of mind that you only really achieve when you're performing in front of an audience and</a>
00:02:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h02m44s">You can try to recreate it, but it'll be fake if you try to do it on your own</a>
00:02:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h02m48s">I don't write I don't write in joke form, like I don't write the way I say it on stage</a>
00:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h02m54s">I write in sort of a conceptual form.</a>
00:02:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h02m59s">I write in an essay form and then I sort of extract things that I think are funny out of that, but they really only</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h03m06s">find their true the true way I'm going to do them</a>
00:03:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h03m11s">I only find that in front of an audience because it's like when the when I'm in front of an audience</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h03m15s">Then it becomes clear to me how I should and shouldn't say things based in part on how they're reacting</a>
00:03:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h03m23s">And based in part on how I feel</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h03m25s">when I'm performing the idea</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h03m27s">Like I find where the the fat of the bit is, and that's where you kind of</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h03m33s">appreciate economy of words and you know what to edit out, and</a>
00:03:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h03m37s">what to elaborate on, what people aren't totally</a>
00:03:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h03m40s">understanding, and what maybe is</a>
00:03:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h03m42s">over-explained, and all that stuff kind of comes together in front of an audience</a>
00:03:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h03m47s">So the essays that you're writing or the writing that you're doing like are they on serious topics? Are they on things you're thinking about</a>
00:03:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h03m54s">philosophically or are you trying specifically to be funny or you just trying to get some thoughts down?</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h03m59s">You know about the way you're thinking about the world?</a>
00:03:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h04m02s">Both</a>
00:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h04m03s">you know, it's like the ideas</a>
00:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h04m06s">if, it's</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h04m07s">See I would say that stand-up comedy, at least the way I do it, it comes in three forms</a>
00:04:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h04m12s">Like there's three steps. In the beginning, you're really just trying to get laughs, you're fighting for survival out there. You're scared</a>
00:04:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h04m18s">That's in the early days of your career. Then you start doing what you think is funny, like things that would make you laugh</a>
00:04:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h04m25s">But then in stage three</a>
00:04:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h04m28s">you start</a>
00:04:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h04m30s">trying to make ideas funny and you try to</a>
00:04:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h04m33s">cleverly introduce ideas into people's heads that maybe they wouldn't</a>
00:04:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h04m38s">entertain without the humor aspect of it. And so when I write, if I write on a subject, whatever the subject might be,</a>
00:04:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h04m46s">I write without thinking oh, I have to make each word funny or I have to make each sentence funny</a>
00:04:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h04m53s">I write just what are my thoughts on this subject and then along the way I find</a>
00:04:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h04m59s">irony and I find</a>
00:04:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h05m02s">ridiculous</a>
00:05:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h05m04s">perceptions and all the things that lead to stand-up comedy material</a>
00:05:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h05m09s">Right, and how</a>
00:05:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h05m09s">and I extract those</a>
00:05:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h05m10s">Right, and how much of their like humor and the whip just occurs to you spontaneously on the stage?</a>
00:05:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h05m16s">Sometimes a lot. It depends on the subject</a>
00:05:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h05m18s">But it's always a possibility, some of the best lines that I've ever come up with</a>
00:05:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h05m23s">in my act to come up with, I come up with on the spot while I'm just talking about things</a>
00:05:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h05m30s">Right, well that should be when you're like into the subject and things are going well with the audience</a>
00:05:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h05m34s">Yeah, yeah, that's basically how it goes</a>
00:05:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h05m37s">It's a tricky business</a>
00:05:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h05m38s">yeah, it sounds like an extremely tricky business and one way the cost of failure is, is</a>
00:05:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h05m44s">humiliation and and and, uh</a>
00:05:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h05m46s">emotional pain</a>
00:05:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h05m48s">Yeah, it's the worst</a>
00:05:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h05m50s">There's not that many things that are more embarrassing than like trying to be funny</a>
00:05:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h05m54s">Especially if you've put say a hundred hours into one hour of preparation</a>
00:05:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h05m58s">Which is less than you're doing and then finding out that you're just not that amusing</a>
00:05:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=00h06m04s">That doesn't sound</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h11m03s">I didn't love being there for fear factor, but it was a great job and I knew it was a great job</a>
02:11:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h11m07s">But I knew I was really lucky to have it. So it was great in that respect</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h11m11s">But when it was over I kind of decided I was done with television when it was over</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h11m24s">I just really focused on stand-up comedy. And that's when my comedy career really took off was post fear factor</a>
02:11:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h11m32s">I mean I had a comedy career during pure fact, er</a>
02:11:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h11m34s">But it really took off post fear factor because I really gave it all of my attention</a>
02:11:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h11m39s">And so what was what what happened after fear factor that boosted you on the comedies on the comedy circuit?</a>
02:11:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h11m46s">Well, I did a special for Comedy Central and Spike TV called talking monkeys in space in 2009 that</a>
02:11:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h11m54s">was like probably my best work up until then and then</a>
02:11:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h11m58s">You know from then I've been on a pretty steady pace of doing specials every two years or so ever since then, right?</a>
02:11:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h12m05s">Right, right and that's being successful. Non-stop. Are you getting better? Yeah, and it's yeah, I think I am. I think I'm getting better</a>
02:12:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h12m12s">I think it's one of those things as long as you keep concentrating on it as long as you keep focusing on it you're getting</a>
02:12:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h12m17s">Better I think my hour that I'm doing now is as good as anything I've ever done and it's not even done yet</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h12m25s">But I think it's some of my best work ever and was really excited to see where it comes</a>
02:12:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h12m29s">Well, I mean probably there's no rush because it's only six months since my last one</a>
02:12:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h12m34s">I probably will work on this friend of the year</a>

02:28:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h28m13s">alternative social media platform soon</a>
02:28:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h28m16s">What going yeah, it's gonna be. Well, we we tried out the first of the technology</a>
02:28:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h28m21s">I just did debate at Slava Lygia on Friday and last Friday</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h28m26s">He was hypothetically the world's foremost Marxist philosopher. Although it turned out that he wasn't really a Marxist at all</a>
02:28:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h28m33s">He called himself a had a lien</a>
02:28:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h28m35s">Which is actually way different than being a Marxist and so it wasn't really much of a debate</a>
02:28:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h28m39s">It was more me attacking the Communist Manifesto for half an hour, which I found rather</a>
02:28:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h28m46s">Straightforward thing to do and then I was having a </a>
02:28:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h28m50s">Peculiar and productive discussion for about an hour and a half. But anyways and things far tested their technology</a>
02:28:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h28m57s">So the live stream technology and we've got some cool features that no other platform has</a>
02:28:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h29m03s">So it'll be a subscription service</a>
02:29:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h29m04s">And so that's partly what makes it a replacement for patreon to some degree, you know, because we want to build and monetize creators</a>
02:29:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h29m11s">But we've got new different Terms of Service. And so the central issue with the Terms of Service will be that</a>
02:29:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h29m19s">once you're on our platform we</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h29m28s">That's basically the idea</a>
02:29:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h29m30s">So we're trying to make an anti censorship</a>
02:29:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h29m32s">Platform and then we've got there's other features too that are quite cool and unique. So for example</a>
02:29:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h29m38s">You might be interested in this with regards to your podcast. So</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h29m42s">If you listen to your podcast on our platform people will be able to like pick a time in the podcast</a>
02:29:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h29m50s">like maybe a 30-second clip and just mark it out and then they'll be able to either make a</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h29m55s">written comment about it or an auditory comment and then send that to a friend or post it so that then running</a>

02:30:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h30m09s">Constant we want to do the same thing for YouTube videos so that people can append</a>
02:30:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h30m14s">Their own video to any part of a video and then distribute that to their network or also post it so that people can watch</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h30m22s">You know so that</a>
02:30:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h30m24s">We're hoping we can get a real dialogue</a>
02:30:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h30m27s">We can really add dialogue to the to the podcast end at a YouTube world</a>
02:30:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h30m33s">We're also going to do the same thing with books. So if you buy an e-book on the platform</a>
02:30:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h30m38s">You'll be able to annotate publicly. And so what that should mean is that every book that's</a>
02:30:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h30m45s">Sold on our platform that many people purchase will become the center of multiple</a>
02:30:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h30m51s">Conversations and we can do that with books that are in the public domain</a>
02:30:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h30m56s">so for example</a>
02:30:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h30m57s">One of the books we're going to post right away is Beyond Good and Evil by Nietzsche and I'm gonna start annotating it</a>
02:30:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h31m03s">You know, and so what what that should mean, you know if you look at the Bible</a>
02:31:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h31m06s">it's good example people have been annotating it for like five thousand years, right every first has</a>
02:31:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h31m12s">God books written on it. So it's just this incredibly expanded document that's pulled in</a>
02:31:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h31m18s">thousands and thousands of people to this collective conversation and this platform should be able to</a>
02:31:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h31m25s">Allow people to do that with with great works of art and well and then with also with current current affairs and events</a>
02:31:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h31m32s">And such as well YouTube videos and podcasts and so it's nice looking to it</a>
02:31:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h31m39s">It's got a fairly professional feel. We're hoping that we'll build a poll</a>
02:31:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h31m45s">People who are interested in intelligent conversation</a>

02:32:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h32m05s">Well so that we can beta test that make sure the damn thing works and that we're not fooling ourselves about its appeal</a>
02:32:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKuwgcKXwY#t=02h32m11s">so that's come a long ways and</a>
