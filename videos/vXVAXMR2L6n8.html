<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVAXMR2L6n8#t=00h04m45s">In his lethargy, he imagines the extremes of violence and lust that must be suppressed</a>
00:04:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVAXMR2L6n8#t=00h04m50s">The solution: more work, more money, more drinking, more things, more online entertainment</a>
00:04:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVAXMR2L6n8#t=00h04m56s">Some of us, on the other hand, understand the importance of becoming a professional</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVAXMR2L6n8#t=00h05m01s">But he continues to delay the initiative</a>
00:05:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVAXMR2L6n8#t=00h05m03s">We tell ourselves: we will become professionals when we "find ourselves"</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVAXMR2L6n8#t=00h05m17s">Because "becoming professional" is not something we do when we heal our problems</a>
