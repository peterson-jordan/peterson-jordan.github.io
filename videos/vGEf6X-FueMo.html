00:00:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h00m38s">Hi Vancouver, thank you</a>
00:00:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h00m43s">Well, we have an interesting situation here</a>
00:00:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h00m46s">This is clearly the second part and some of you were here at last night's event</a>
00:00:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h00m52s">We're going to find a way to update all of you about what happened last night</a>
00:00:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h00m58s">But before we do that, I think it makes sense to talk to you about: Where are we in this debate and why is it important?</a>
00:00:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h01m06s">And it's important not only for us on stage, but it really matters to all of you, the audience</a>
00:01:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h01m11s">The point is, we have reached a point in history where ...</a>
00:01:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h01m15s">Logic tool that usually helps us understand what we are thinking</a>
00:01:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h01m20s">Obviously, things are starting to unravel</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h01m23s">Political parties, universities and the press, all these things have no meaning</a>
00:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h01m29s">And networks of alternatives to logic are emerging</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h01m33s">And the logic we ended up with seemed to go against the logic of survival</a>
00:01:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h01m41s">And to be a vital part of the conversation but that depends on something specific</a>
00:01:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h01m46s">This depends on our ability to define what we can discuss and explore</a>
00:01:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h01m52s">Sam and Jordan have pinpointed each other's mistakes in the past as you all know</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h01m59s">And our ability to update the dialogue in a way that both can find common ground</a>
00:01:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h02m04s">And for us to move forward together it is probably very important</a>
00:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h02m08s">Very important update</a>
00:02:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h02m10s">This modernization in the contemporary era includes you all because</a>
00:02:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h02m14s">Our dialogue and your conversations are all online now</a>
00:02:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h02m20s">So the common ground includes not visualizing what is happening on stage tonight, and the reason for that is ...</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h02m27s">What happens to this theater tonight has consequences</a>
00:02:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h02m31s">And all Sam and Jordan felt more freedom to use new tools and new situations that they might not have explored before</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h02m39s">The closer we become to success</a>
00:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h02m41s">Please do not photograph, and that would not mean that we do not want you to talk about what we discussed here tonight.</a>
00:02:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h02m48s">We are very excited to see what you will make of this dialogue and where it will go</a>
00:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h02m54s">So, in an attempt to update you about where we got yesterday</a>
00:02:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h02m59s">I think the evidence is strong for all of us, and the conversation on the Internet inspired</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h03m05s">That we did a big part yesterday, we made progress</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h03m09s">To try to keep this momentum going, but what we're going to do is we're going to get Sam and Jordan to prove.</a>
00:03:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h03m18s">Score each other from last night so that you can hear what they look like</a>
00:03:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h03m21s">right Now</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h03m29s">And for those of you who have not tried this principle of fixation with anyone you deeply disagree with, you know how difficult this is</a>
00:03:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h03m37s">So let's give them some room. Sam Would you like to start?</a>
00:03:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h03m41s">Of course</a>
00:03:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h03m44s">Thanks.</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h03m48s">Well, first of all, let me just make the obvious points that maybe not very clear</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h03m55s">Once you put yourself in our shoes but just imagine how surreal it is</a>
00:03:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h04m00s">For us to be where we are just having a conversation about ideas</a>
00:04:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h04m05s">And to be able to schedule an appointment on the calendar and have the honor of having all of you attend for that, I mean, it's a wonderful privilege.</a>
00:04:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h04m11s">Thank you all for coming</a>
00:04:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h04m17s">Well here's what I think Jordan thinks I just don't get it</a>
00:04:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h04m23s">I think this is grammatically correct. Maybe here is another note, however</a>
00:04:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h04m30s">Obviously, I don't understand how valuable these stories are</a>
00:04:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h04m36s">And how deep is it not only the wisdom of our ancestors, but perhaps wisdom</a>
00:04:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h04m46s">Generated from the blows of the evolution of the races</a>
00:04:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h04m50s">is not it? So there is no way to know the depth of the amount of information contained in the stories</a>
00:04:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h04m57s">And there is a type of story which is religious stories and their respective religions for a reason because they deal with the deeper questions in human life.</a>
00:04:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h05m05s">Her questions about what constitutes the good life, what is worth living for, and what is worth dying for</a>
00:05:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h05m11s">These are things, if everyone is thrust into the theater of his life</a>
00:05:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h05m20s">Without knowing where he is tasked with knowing how to live by himself</a>
00:05:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h05m28s">Or how with others who are also not guided by ancient wisdom</a>
00:05:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h05m35s">This is not knowledge that we can easily repeat for ourselves</a>
00:05:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h05m40s">So we edit or ignore these stories at our own risk, to a degree, to a minimum, to a degree of risk</a>
00:05:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h05m51s">Because we do not know much .. We do not know of any mistake that we can avoid, and we must impose great respect for these traditions</a>
00:05:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h06m00s">and this is...</a>
00:06:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h06m08s">What will be discovered tonight I'm still not sure how this relates to</a>
00:06:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h06m16s">More allegorical suggestions for the origin of some of these stories</a>
00:06:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h06m22s">But at a minimum monetary debt</a>
00:06:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h06m26s">Because it tends to focus on the clearer issue</a>
00:06:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h06m32s">For a game in which there is an absolute winner or loser between religious beliefs and open scientific debate</a>
00:06:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h06m40s">Which does not address that central issue which is the importance of religious thinking and religious narrative</a>
00:06:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h06m49s">Because most of the time I shoot fish in a barrel for my criticism of militants</a>
00:06:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h06m56s">And the god that fanatics believe in is a god who is an invisible person who hates homosexuals</a>
00:06:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h07m03s">This is clearly not the deepest version of these religions</a>
00:07:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h07m09s">This essentialism is a narrative technology for directing human life in the universe</a>
00:07:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h07m16s">So maybe I'll stop here, but that's what I think Jordan believes</a>
00:07:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h07m27s">Before you prove Sam’s point, how do you feel about his summarizing your point?</a>
00:07:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h07m34s">I am satisfied, man</a>
00:07:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h07m39s">I mean, I have two things to say about this that at first I thought it was accurate, clear, and fair</a>
00:07:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h07m47s">And I think that</a>
00:07:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h07m50s">This isn't somehow a technical note that if you ever want to think about something this is exactly what you should be doing</a>
00:07:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h07m56s">is not it ? You want to accept arguments that are against your belief and want to make them as strong as possible</a>
00:07:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h08m02s">So that you can fortify your argument against them you don't want to weaken them because that makes you weak as well</a>
00:08:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h08m07s">As you know, Wissam and I are both a scientist and the issue is really what the scientists are trying to do</a>
00:08:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h08m12s">And I think what we're really trying to do with this dialogue is honest</a>
00:08:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h08m16s">Is trying to find if something is stupid</a>
00:08:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h08m20s">As you know ino when I show the arguments Sam just summed up very well</a>
00:08:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h08m26s">I try to create a set of objections to them in my mind</a>
00:08:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h08m32s">And the arguments you have presented are arguments that I cannot underestimate</a>
00:08:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h08m35s">However, this does not mean that it is correct, it does not mean this at all</a>
00:08:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h08m39s">So if someone submits</a>
00:08:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h08m41s">And this is really the case if you are a scientist, someone will come and say, "Look, I did something wrong with this basic assumption."</a>
00:08:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h08m48s">Yes wonderful! This means that I can make progress towards a more solid theory of formation</a>
00:08:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h08m53s">So this is what we're trying to do and I think it works so I think it was totally fine to the core</a>
00:08:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h08m59s">And I hope to do justice to your position as well, so I'll summarize Sam's argument briefly</a>
00:08:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h09m06s">Then I'll tell him and let you audience know why he thinks I don't take his opinion into account</a>
00:09:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h09m13s">So, Sam thinks ...</a>
00:09:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h09m16s">That there are two main risks to social and psychological stability</a>
00:09:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h09m21s">Religious extremism is on the right, and morality is relative and nihilistic on the left</a>
00:09:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h09m29s">And so the danger of the right-wing position is that it enables people to arbitrarily form axioms</a>
00:09:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h09m37s">As indisputable facts and then to terrorize themselves and other people</a>
00:09:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h09m41s">By believing that these intuitions are absolute manifestations</a>
00:09:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h09m44s">He sees it as part of the danger of religious extremism and possibly religious thinking in general</a>
00:09:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h09m49s">But also as something personified as traditional secular countries that also have a religious dimension</a>
00:09:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h09m55s">So this is on the right and then on Elissa the problem of relativist, nihilistic morality stance</a>
00:09:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h10m01s">Is that she leaves us without any direction and she too ...</a>
00:10:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h10m04s">Flying in the face of common sense is that there are bad ways to live and there are good ways to live</a>
00:10:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h10m11s">So that people generally agree with it, and statements regarding these general agreements regarding how to live can be considered realistic</a>
00:10:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h10m18s">And then the other part of Sam's claim is that we require a valuable system</a>
00:10:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h10m24s">What allows us to escape from these twin dangers, the first is stupid and the other leaves us without hope, let's say</a>
00:10:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h10m30s">This value system must be rooted in something real</a>
00:10:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h10m33s">The only thing that is seen to be stating the truth in any form proven by evidence</a>
00:10:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h10m39s">There is a certain amount of historical and conceptual weight behind this claim</a>
00:10:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h10m43s">It is the domain of empirical facts as they manifest themselves in science and technology</a>
00:10:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h10m47s">That made us so powerful, able to thrive in the world</a>
00:10:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h10m52s">Amazingly, so we have to root our position at the top with something that we can identify and that is really solid</a>
00:10:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h10m58s">So that we can orient ourselves properly so that we can make moral claims and we can also avoid these sinister twins.</a>
00:10:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h11m05s">We can start with some preliminary facts which we can define as I mentioned briefly</a>
00:11:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h11m10s">It dictates a bad life, endless pain, suffering, and anxiety</a>
00:11:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h11m15s">And a huge amount of negative emotions, and a short life</a>
00:11:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h11m17s">And all the things that a person would not choose for themselves</a>
00:11:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h11m21s">If we agree they are thinking healthy</a>
00:11:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h11m25s">And we can reverse this horror field in the good life which might include ...</a>
00:11:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h11m30s">Certainly freedom from denial and want to nullify danger and anxiety</a>
00:11:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h11m35s">And hope for the future and all this and that we can agree that these foundations are good and bad, and this is a realistic claim.</a>
00:11:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h11m42s">Sam also claims we can define the good life that's an extension of him</a>
00:11:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h11m47s">In reference to prosperity and prosperity that can be measured</a>
00:11:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h11m51s">And that we have to, and we can think of prosperity and prosperity with empirical data</a>
00:11:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h11m57s">After saying all this he is also leaving ...</a>
00:11:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h12m02s">An open field of inquiry which focuses on the possibility of some of the ideas stored in the religious phenomenon</a>
00:12:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h12m11s">Or even religious beliefs can be worth pursuing as well. Perhaps there is some wisdom that can be applied</a>
00:12:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h12m18s">In practical terms, in terms of perception as well regarding religious practices</a>
00:12:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h12m21s">Although these practices can become increasingly dangerous as they become confined to the faith</a>
00:12:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h12m26s">So here's Sam's position and then his critique of my ideas</a>
00:12:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h12m33s">He may tell the facts, and it is not stories that lay the foundations for the science of prosperity</a>
00:12:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h12m40s">So that we don't need to be connected to the stories, the old stories in particular and the reason for that</a>
00:12:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h12m47s">These ancient stories are satisfactory in some detail, especially in some of the specific claims they make</a>
00:12:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h12m54s">Which seems somewhat unacceptable from a contemporary perspective</a>
00:12:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h12m58s">He believes that he is waving to ignore these specific topics and with ...</a>
00:12:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h13m03s">What can you invite, with an optimistic view of the entire context</a>
00:13:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h13m09s">They are seriously unfashionable, or even if they are useful at all</a>
00:13:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h13m13s">They are subject to many possible explanations</a>
00:13:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h13m19s">For any modern use they are reliably derived. And so he believes ...</a>
00:13:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h13m24s">That attempts to explain those stories, let's say</a>
00:13:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h13m27s">They are rifles that have a wide variety of possible errors such as bias, interpretation, and objectivity so that ...</a>
00:13:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h13m34s">All interpretations are unreliable and perhaps equally unreliable</a>
00:13:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h13m39s">So that her day is even worse than this is not that she is just unreliable.</a>
00:13:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h13m43s">But they are just as dangerous as the claims that they pose a threat to scientific and Enlightenment values</a>
00:13:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h13m50s">And who are the true saviors of humanity, as is confirmed by our progress, let us say over the past two hundred or three hundred years</a>
00:13:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h13m56s">They are also subject to the authoritarian interpretation that I described earlier</a>
00:13:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h14m02s">Which gives the interpreter a feeling of it. And then a claim to reveal the truth</a>
00:14:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h14m07s">With this I say this is Sam's argument and his criticism of my position</a>
00:14:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h14m13s">Okay, so you are writing me my next book and I will be writing your next book</a>
00:14:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h14m20s">Sam, how do you feel about your diagnosis?</a>
00:14:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h14m26s">Certainly close enough to start the conversation. I mean, there are some basic things that we have that we may still talk about</a>
00:14:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h14m33s">And I am not so clinging to material experimental science as I heard from his hint a while ago</a>
00:14:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h14m42s">But we can go back to that</a>
00:14:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h14m44s">Well wait, I guess from the crowd's point of view ...</a>
00:14:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h14m47s">That's a good measure of where he got to last night and I honestly think ...</a>
00:14:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h14m52s">The gains are very interesting which I must say are terribly due to something called pullback from the median</a>
00:14:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h15m00s">If I catch either of you backsliding on average, I'll chase you and lose you on Twitter tomorrow</a>
00:15:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h15m07s">I warned you!</a>
00:15:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h15m11s">Does one of you want to talk about what was missing in the other’s diagnosis or how would you like us to progress?</a>
00:15:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h15m19s">I think we must touch this issue, the issue of symbolic truth</a>
00:15:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h15m24s">Because I think it still causes distance between us</a>
00:15:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h15m29s">Certainly and happily this is your convention you may want to support this convention</a>
00:15:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h15m35s">why not?</a>
00:15:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h15m37s">The idea of ​​an idiomatic truth, which I honestly believe represents reconciliation between points</a>
00:15:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h15m43s">That you both started at least is the idea that there are concepts</a>
00:15:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h15m49s">Literally false which we can scientifically prove incorrect</a>
00:15:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h15m54s">But if you acted as if they were right then you might be out ahead of what you were if you acted on the fact that it was wrong.</a>
00:15:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h16m03s">Simply describing these things wrong is wrong</a>
00:16:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h16m07s">And the universe left them correct in some sense other than the literal meaning</a>
00:16:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h16m13s">So religions, according to what I've already heard from both Gordon and Sam</a>
00:16:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h16m18s">Religions follow this kind of thing. These things are included ...</a>
00:16:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h16m25s">With stories and recipes that if you follow them regardless of whether they are literally describing the universe</a>
00:16:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h16m32s">You end up with certain preferences that you probably won't know why they are there, but regardless</a>
00:16:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h16m37s">You are ahead of your position in whether you are just navigating your awareness and that is the concept</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h16m45s">Yeah I think there's a good analogy, we just ran into it after we podcasted together</a>
00:16:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h16m51s">You had an analogy of a porcupine that could shoot its thorns</a>
00:16:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h16m55s">Which many people fear, but a listener gave us a better analogy:</a>
00:16:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h17m00s">Phrase of the idea that anyone who has handled firearms in any way may have heard</a>
00:17:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h17m06s">With a warning about how to handle any firearm as if it were loaded with bullets</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h17m12s">And you really were last night when you pretended to believe in God you corrected me saying you are living as if God exists, right?</a>
00:17:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h17m21s">So it looks like there's a connection here if I have a firearm and I want to show it to Burt</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h19m56s">It is the nature of our disagreement about the relationship between facts and values</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h20m28s">So I'm going to spend two or three minutes going through the story of a sacrifice, and the reason for that is because ...</a>
00:20:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h20m35s">It is what I think happened at the origin of these deep stories</a>
00:20:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h20m40s">People first begin to act in a certain way that has a survival character</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h20m47s">This method was chosen as a result ...</a>
00:20:47</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h20m56s">And so this was incorporated into the behavior and then because we can observe ourselves because we are self-conscious beings</a>
00:20:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h21m02s">We started modeling these patterns, studying them, and then wrapping them in stories</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h21m11s">So they might be kind of like chimpanzees or wolves becoming conscious of the dominance hierarchy</a>
00:21:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h21m16s">And the strategies they use. Wolves, for example. If there is a dispute between two wolves</a>
00:21:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h21m22s">One may advance its neck first and place it unprotected so that the other wolf can tear it apart and then the other wolf does not.</a>
00:21:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h21m29s">You could say that it appears as if a wolf is following a rule about not killing the weaker of the herd</a>
00:21:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h21m35s">Of course, wolves do not follow any rules, but they do follow patterns of behavior</a>
00:21:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h21m38s">Only a self-conscious wolf will see what the wolves do</a>
00:21:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h21m42s">Then he says we will act in such a way that every wolf in the herd has intrinsic value</a>
00:21:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h21m48s">And then it starts to be, and maybe that wolf has a short story about the hero wolf who never tears the neck of its opponent</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h21m56s">This is a good thing, this is good wolf manners, and this is rooted in original behavior</a>

00:25:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h25m45s">If you give up something of value now, you can have something of more value in the future</a>

00:26:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h26m47s">You think animals, in general, might be acting on the idea of ​​delaying returns as their instincts run out.</a>
00:26:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h26m55s">But they don't think about it that animals are clearly giving up something they value now to be able to thrive in the future.</a>
00:26:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h27m02s">There is an old story about how to catch a monkey. True?</a>
00:27:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h27m06s">You put out a bowl with rocks in it, and then put a few small sweets in this bowl with a narrow neck</a>
00:27:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h27m10s">You put sweets on the rocks inside and put some sweets in front of the bowl</a>
00:27:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h27m15s">Then the monkey comes to collect the sweets, puts his hand in the bowl and holds the sweets, and he cannot remove them</a>
00:27:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h27m20s">I still don't know if this method works for monkeys or not, but it's a great story</a>
00:27:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h27m23s">I don't know about this either, but here are various claims</a>
00:27:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h27m28s">But the point is, you can catch a monkey this way, the monkey will not let go of the candy maybe he might leave it</a>
00:27:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h27m34s">The problem, however, is that it is not clear that animals will give up something now in exchange for prospering in the future</a>
00:27:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h27m41s">I don't think that's true, to be honest. Frankly, I want ...</a>
00:27:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h27m44s">The question is whether they will do it while they are aware of it, perhaps they will, but what they do is not the question</a>
00:27:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h27m50s">It's very difficult to know if it's a conscious act because they don't answer questions</a>
00:27:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h27m53s">What I do know is that it is clear that the line between doing something and being consciously doing it is weak</a>
00:27:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h28m02s">But what seems to me has happened is that after we noticed that people ...</a>
00:28:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h28m08s">Those who are able to delay gratification sacrifice things they value in exchange for a future goal</a>
00:28:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h28m14s">And we may stick with it. So we started writing it down as a representation and then we started visualizing it</a>
00:28:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h28m20s">So the story, you can say, well this spawned different kinds</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h28m25s">But the reason is also, I guess ...</a>
00:28:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h28m28s">Imagine there is a rule of thumb to sacrifice what you see now in exchange for guaranteed benefits in the future</a>
00:28:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h28m38s">Then the question becomes how good are these benefits</a>
00:28:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h28m43s">And that might be heavenly, let's say, in the most extreme example and what ultimate sacrifice could you make?</a>
00:28:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h28m51s">And then I'll say: Well, baby sacrifice is in that category</a>
00:28:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h28m54s">So it's one of the ideas that drove extreme extremism, and you might say this is an extreme thing</a>
00:28:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h29m02s">It is, it is a pathological extremism</a>
00:29:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h29m05s">But I think we can also understand that some of the same things we have learned ....</a>
00:29:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h29m11s">As we evolved towards our current state of wisdom as it is now</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h29m15s">Is that we learned it in a very bloody and tragic way</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h29m18s">They were learning very hard and delaying gratification was definitely one of these things, that it's a wonderful thing</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h29m45s">This can motivate you, so delayed gratification is a completely separate thing, it probably makes sense</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h31m29s">In "The Moral Landscape" you define this way that there is a good life and a bad life. is not it?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h45m52s">I would like to see this structured in a more realistic way and I want to know how your concept fits into your understanding</a>
00:45:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h45m58s">Because one of the claims you make in the "moral landscape" is that the distinction between a bad and a good life is only that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h46m05s">It is as if it is a realistic difference. Yes, it is a universal concept and it is true that, as I believe your main claim, I do not see</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h46m19s">So, this is the situation and you can forget about morality as a concept</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h46m25s">So I think the starting point is deeper than morality, the starting point and that's it, this is our starting point</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h46m31s">We are all in the Universe at the moment. The starting point is that we know we don't have a party to admit</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h50m55s">What seems toxic to me is, as if you are assuming that the rational approach will override the traditional metaphorical approach</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h51m45s">Yes. This is definitely possible. And in fact you could even say it probably was based on</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h51m51s">The fact that we have all of these systems still exists</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h52m51s">We are losers either way. It appears to be the case if we remain veiled in our current state of apprehension</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h53m18s">Now, in part of the issue here, as you can see, I think that this is the problem. Let's take the idea of ​​a doctrine</a>
00:53:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h53m27s">For example. Okay, so there is a dogma included in the books, but I'm going to throw the books because the dogma</a>
00:53:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h53m31s">It existed before the books, and the question is where was the doctrine? The answer was that the doctrine was in cultural practices</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h53m37s">But it was also in the agreement that people made about these cultural practices, and in that agreement</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h53m44s">It was also an integral part of the shared psychological structure that enables us to perceive the world in this way. The problem is now</a>
00:53:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h53m50s">And I think that's the central place where we need to materialize these ideas, is that you cannot see</a>
00:53:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h53m56s">The world is without a prior structure and that an earlier structure has a doctrinal component and thus you cannot just say: Let's get rid of the dogma</a>
00:53:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h54m03s">Because you cannot perceive a world without a prior structure - that it contains an insignificant component</a>
00:54:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=00h54m07s">Because if you're only talking about perceiving the world, yes, we do have a perceptual structure that allows us to see the world</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=01h32m33s">And one of the answers may be the fundamental material pillar of the world</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=01h32m50s">So for example there is the problem that we have a two-fold brain</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=01h32m56s">The question is why do we have this two-pronged brain and the answer may be not just us but animals as well</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=01h33m18s">It appears to be dealing with exceptions to the rule by addressing them, by standardizing them and then trying to identify patterns</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=01h33m26s">And then trying to discern the patterns that unite them, such as correcting the totalitarian system imposed by the left hemisphere in some way</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=01h33m32s">You could say that the left and right halves are adapted for something like different areas left and undiscovered areas on the right.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=01h34m18s">Here is a reason why good and evil cannot be permanent in the usual sense, certainly not in the Christian or Judeo-Christian sense</a>
01:34:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=01h34m24s">One is that, the Judeo-Christian concept of evil is not included ....</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=01h34m31s">But, Sam, you introduced the idea of ​​good versus evil in the "moral scene."</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=01h34m35s">No, but also in an Eastern or Buddhist or Hindu context, evil is not true evil but rather ignorance.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=01h34m41s">Of course you could argue that you say, well, this is because they haven't met anyone who is evil enough that they think it's not.</a>

01:35:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=01h35m59s">The reason why evil is subject to complete shrinkage is that, if you agree with me</a>
01:35:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=01h36m06s">Evil is a class of wrong human behavior and human intention</a>

01:36:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=01h36m32s">So it's the classic villainous mass killer</a>
01:36:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=01h36m37s">But he complains about this change, which he thinks he is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=01h37m03s">Morally and then you look at someone like Saddam Hussein and the most evil person you can imagine and then you say</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=01h37m50s">Well take the worst of the people who in a sadistic way sacrificed the most people, and these are the most evil people we can call them.</a>
01:37:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=01h38m00s">So when you say ... I think this is very important because I think true evil of this kind is very rare and there is a lot of bad ...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=01h38m15s">We just presented a whole bunch of things for others in our latest round of dialogue on free will and evil</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=01h38m21s">But just to explain why you talked about this, you were saying this, I forgot the word I used</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=01h38m29s">You said this is inevitable, inevitable or permanent. Your characterization was that this category of "evil" is permanent</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=01h38m37s">And I say that I don't think evil is a permanent category because there is so much information about it that we are still waiting for</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=01h38m44s">Well, for the sake of conceptual clarity, we'll be separating for a minute between good and bad</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h07m02s">So my problem with religion is that we often meet these people</a>
02:07:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h07m06s">We are at work and we do not criticize these people</a>
02:07:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h07m09s">We have no place to criticize these people because we are attached to the game</a>
02:07:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h07m15s">Fair enough. Why don't we do this? Why doesn't it take us all three minutes to sum it all up</a>
02:07:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h07m21s">-Think. Yes, we have come to the end. We are at the end of time, so why don’t you both take three minutes to summarize and then announce the end?</a>
02:07:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h07m28s">I'm sure Sam was the last. Wanna start here?</a>
02:07:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h07m37s">So there's a lot of things we agree with Sam</a>
02:07:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h07m42s">But the devil is in the details, for sure</a>
02:07:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h07m46s">I'm very sympathetic to his claim that we need to anchor our moral systems with something solid and clear</a>
02:07:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h07m57s">And my problem is, I am not sure how we can achieve this</a>
02:07:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h08m02s">I do not believe that a valuable construct can be derived based on your experience with facts</a>
02:08:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h08m08s">There are many facts that can be observed and you need a structure to explain them that you do not have</a>
02:08:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h08m15s">And that's part of the reason why this was talked about in a nervous way</a>
02:08:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h08m20s">It is that you have a compact, deep physique that is partly biological in nature and in part it is a consequential emergence of your social activity</a>
02:08:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h08m31s">It looks at the realm of facts through this structure, which is the evidence of values</a>
02:08:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h08m36s">And perhaps this value structure may have been derived from the realm of facts over the evolutionary time scale</a>
02:08:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h08m41s">But it is not, nor can it be, derived from the realm of facts across the time scale in which you live</a>
02:08:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h08m47s">And my problem in our discussion so far is not with</a>
02:08:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h08m52s">Sam's Moral Claims Because I believe there is a distinction between an infernal life and a heavenly life</a>
02:08:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h08m59s">A life that everyone agrees is not worth living and a life that we can imagine as good</a>
02:08:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h09m05s">And I really believe that we must move from one direction to the other</a>
02:09:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h09m08s">But the question is how exactly can we make the decisions that will lead us down this path</a>
02:09:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h09m16s">And I don't believe that we can do it without an intuitive intention</a>
02:09:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h09m19s">In fact, I think the overwhelming evidence says that we cannot, and I also mean the scientific evidence</a>
02:09:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h09m25s">I would like to go further in the direction of the devil in the details</a>
02:09:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h09m31s">This is my position at this moment</a>
02:09:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h09m49s">Good part of these conversations</a>
02:09:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h09m53s">I think I had four discussions, we did two podcasts, our second live talk</a>
02:09:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h09m59s">- And thanks for doing this, by the way, this is from ... -It's a pleasure</a>
02:09:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h10m04s">I have the honor to do so</a>
02:10:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h10m07s">And this comes with the risks for both of us to be able to do this</a>
02:10:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h10m15s">I think you can feel that we don't have exactly the same audience. Each of you encourages one of us or the other to some degree</a>
02:10:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h10m24s">Or for the spirit of truth</a>
02:10:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h10m33s">Obviously, this dialogue is the point, right?</a>
02:10:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h10m36s">Although this dialogue bore the characteristics of a debate many times</a>
02:10:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h10m42s">I don't think any of us took it that way in a general sense.</a>
02:10:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h10m47s">The issue is not a matter of scoring points, it is a matter of finding meaning in a coherent way</a>
02:10:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h10m53s">Because we are talking about issues with big consequences and it is clear that you care about these issues</a>
02:10:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h10m59s">It is important to see whether we will approach the most important questions in a person's life</a>
02:10:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h11m04s">And as you know, I worry that religion is not giving us the tools we need</a>
02:11:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h11m10s">To meet, but what gives us these tools is open conversation</a>
02:11:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h11m20s">Indeed, then you simply have to look at the obstacles to the open conversation</a>
02:11:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h11m28s">And religion introduces those things that are first of all to the idea that certain things have been determined for all time</a>
02:11:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h11m39s">And that there is no future evidence or argument for these points</a>
02:11:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h11m45s">This is definitely bad in all areas of science</a>
02:11:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h11m49s">It is bad in all aspects of how we renegotiate our closeness to each other in society</a>
02:11:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h11m57s">New laws and ideas are born all the time about how institutions and social relationships are structured</a>
02:11:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h12m03s">Because new things happen we don't have the internet and then we have</a>
02:12:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h12m07s">So our old rules and old expectations about human communication simply no longer function in the presence of these things</a>
02:12:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h12m14s">So we need to know again that this is a steering problem, which I have always faced</a>
02:12:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h12m23s">Even in conversations like this is the sense that the rules have to stand out</a>
02:12:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h12m30s">Simply for this category of books which is on this side of the library</a>
02:12:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h12m36s">Any other aspect of the library is not a hindrance to an honest conversation</a>
02:12:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h12m42s">But when you go to these books there you have to keep your tongue</a>
02:12:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h12m48s">There we cannot choose</a>
02:12:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h12m52s">We can say that Shakespeare wrote some of the most amazing plays ever and some of them actually did not do well</a>
02:12:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h12m58s">We cannot say this about God but rather we have to find some tormented way to benefit from his satanic sayings</a>
02:12:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h13m06s">And this is the thing that we have to overcome and I am constantly in tension with you because the way you speak</a>
02:13:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h13m16s">On religion, the power of narration, and the meaning derived from it</a>
02:13:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h13m22s">It identifies with this point and seems to allow people to get away with it</a>
02:13:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h13m27s">And this, and here we must draw a line on which we must ...</a>
02:13:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h13m38s">It should be clear to us at this point in history that whoever has no right to religious sectarianism ...</a>
02:13:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h13m50s">There is a FIFA World Cup version of it which is useful</a>
02:13:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h13m57s">But once we get past this point we need to know how to apply the brakes</a>
02:13:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h14m04s">This becomes a real problem if you are to honor the fundamental claims of these religions</a>
02:14:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h14m11s">Which claims things like revelation, heaven, blasphemy, and apostasy.</a>
02:14:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h14m16s">I mean these are the things that you come across and I think conversations like these are very important</a>
02:14:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h14m24s">Because we need to convince the largest part of humanity that we can live</a>
02:14:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h14m29s">The best possible life without resorting to divisive nonsense</a>
02:14:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h14m36s">This is where we draw the line between nonsense, logic, and unnecessary rhetoric</a>
02:14:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h14m41s">It is what we bicker about and I think the important thing is that we communicate</a>
02:14:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h15m06s">In conclusion, let me say, first of all it is a great honor for me that you asked me to conduct these discussions.</a>
02:15:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h15m15s">Wonderful, thank you</a>
02:15:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h15m22s">It was a really great experience. As for what was accomplished, I think it was an impressive amount</a>
02:15:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h15m29s">I saw both of you moving. I saw each of you showing great spiritual generosity towards the other</a>
02:15:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h15m36s">And I think that greatly exceeded my expectations of what could be possible in these discussions</a>
02:15:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h15m43s">And this also I will say has a lot to do with the fact that none of us can explain</a>
02:15:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h15m51s">Lots of people for various reasons, a large number of people seem to care about these issues because they are very important</a>
02:15:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h15m59s">So anyway, I think this was a very successful exercise</a>
02:15:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h16m03s">And I think you can both be proud of what you have done</a>
02:16:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo#t=02h16m06s">Okay, so let's give a big round of applause to our speakers tonight</a>
