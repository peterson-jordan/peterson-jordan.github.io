00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h00m02s">Thank you so much for coming in you're developing this enormous power and reach is it the heavy burden for it?</a>
00:00:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h00m10s">Well it it's heavy and light at the same time. You know it's it's constant I</a>
00:00:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h00m16s">Don't know what I'm doing day-to-day until that day</a>
00:00:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h00m18s">I have people managing my schedule, and I'm busy enough so that I pretty much attend to the next thing</a>
00:00:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h00m24s">But the responsibility of getting into all these heads mm-hmm</a>
00:00:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h00m27s">And you are influencing people's signa me aren't you?</a>
00:00:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h00m30s">well</a>
00:00:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h00m31s">I guess I take solace in the fact that so many thousands of people now have written to me and also talked to me</a>
00:00:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h00m36s">to say that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h00m38s">Things are better for them because they've been trying to do some of the things that I suggest in my lectures and so</a>
00:00:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h00m44s">It is a heavy responsibility</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h00m57s">That seems to be the case.</a>
00:00:57</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h00m59s">Saving lives too? Well, I would say there were six people in the audience last night. I was talking in Melbourne</a>
00:00:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h01m06s">I would say there were six, maybe there were more but there were at least six so half a dozen</a>
00:01:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h01m10s">And they were young men who told me that that that's that's what they said</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h01m14s">That you had served their lives.</a>
00:01:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h01m16s">Yeah, how do you feel about that?</a>
00:01:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h01m20s">Breaks me up. Why, it's a very positive thing you've done. What what do you mean it breaks you up?</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h01m27s">Well it's sad that there are so many people in that</a>
00:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h01m32s">State of crisis you know and they don't need</a>
00:01:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h01m36s">that much encouragement</a>
00:01:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h01m38s">That's the thing.</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h01m40s">So,</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h01m42s">It's sad that it only takes that much encouragement to make that much difference. There's a lot of lost people in the world</a>
00:01:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h01m49s">So it's a good thing to be able to help that</a>
00:01:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h01m53s">It's overwhelming. Well I can tell that you're very emotional about it.</a>
00:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h01m58s">Yeah, well it's really something. You know what time I hadn't thought much about what had happened last night, but you know</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h02m04s">probably 500 people lined up after the talk and</a>
00:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h02m09s">Most of them say the same thing you know about a quarter of them say look you're putting into words things</a>
00:02:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h02m15s">I already knew I always knew but I didn't know how to say just like oh</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h02m18s">That's what archetypal stories do and and I guess that's what articulate people</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h02m22s">Do you know so that's a good thing, but then the other 3/4 of them say some variant of?</a>
00:02:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h02m29s">You know my life has been turned around</a>
00:02:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h02m31s">They say I was addicted or I was drinking too much, or I wasn't moving ahead my relationship with my girlfriend</a>
00:02:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h02m37s">I wasn't getting along with my family. I didn't have any direction in life</a>
00:02:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h02m40s">I was nihilistic or hopeless or anxious or any number of variants of those and</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h02m45s">I've been trying to put into practice what you've been talking about in your YouTube lectures and</a>
00:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h02m50s">podcasts and and</a>
00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h02m52s">It's really helped my turn my life around. Thank you. It's like</a>
00:02:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h02m57s">Yeah</a>
00:02:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h02m59s">Do something you feel fragile about that</a>
00:02:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h03m04s">Well</a>
00:03:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h03m07s">No, I wouldn't say exactly that um I seem to be able to handle this</a>
00:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h03m13s">It's been going on a long time now. It's it's been 18 months, and I would say in many ways now</a>
00:03:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h03m18s">It's better than it was because at the beginning</a>
00:03:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h03m21s">Especially when I got when I put my hat in the political ring</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h03m24s">Let's say because I felt that the Canadian politicians had overstepped their boundaries</a>
00:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h03m30s">You know my job was threatened and</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h03m32s">quite severely, and I thought I might lose my clinical license as well and</a>
00:03:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h03m37s">Things were up in the air in a big way.  This was over the gender pronoun usage.</a>
00:03:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h03m41s">Yeah was my refusal when I stated refusal to abide by the</a>
00:03:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h03m46s">by the requirement that that I</a>
00:03:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h03m49s">modified my language in a certain manner that I</a>
00:03:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h03m51s">Felt was you know appropriate</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h03m54s">oh
I felt it was inappropriate of the government to demand that I modify my language the government has no right to</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h03m59s">Intrude on people's lives to that degree</a>
00:03:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h04m01s">It's very very dangerous when that happens and so anyways there was I've been in one scandal after another in Canada like seriously like</a>
00:04:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h04m09s">Non-stop for 18 months the last one. Just two days ago. I was at Queen's University in Kingston, and there was a big</a>
00:04:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h04m17s">Demonstration there was a very eerie</a>
00:04:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h04m19s">Occurrence they arrested a woman who was carrying a garrote for God's sake you know.  Does that frighten you?</a>
00:04:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h04m25s">That was not good, the Queen's University thing was not good. We were in a hall. It was kind of like a church this</a>
00:04:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h04m30s">this Hall. It's what it looked like it was lined with stained glass windows and</a>
00:04:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h04m34s">probably 20 of them and there was a</a>
00:04:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h04m37s">Protester had climbed up in the window well of all 20 windows</a>
00:04:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h04m41s">probably five or six feet off the ground and there were seven feet high these windows and they were pounding on them and</a>
00:04:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h04m46s">Forcefully forcefully enough in one case to break the window and so there was 900 of us inside</a>
00:04:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h04m51s">and it was we were surrounded by this group that were pounding on the windows and yelling and pounding on the doors and</a>
00:04:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h05m00s">It was and you know you could see against the stained glass you could see these shadowy forms pounding away</a>
00:05:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h05m05s">And it was it was very eerie. No one and no one in that Hall will ever forget that experience.  Why?</a>
00:05:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h05m11s">Why were they trying to get in why the garotte, why the, it sounds like hate is it hate?</a>
00:05:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h05m17s">Some of it was hate for sure. Why, why do they hate you?</a>
00:05:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h05m20s">Because they because of who they imagine I might be I guess that's part of it</a>
00:05:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h05m26s">You know it's it's it's easy to hate someone who's been caricatured and</a>
00:05:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h05m31s">So, but there's more to it than that I have been very</a>
00:05:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h05m35s">Forceful. Let's say and my criticisms of the radical left not only in Canada</a>
00:05:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h05m39s">But in the West in general not critical enough in my estimation, so I hold no stock whatsoever for the radical leftist</a>
00:05:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64MlP8mbJPo#t=00h05m46s">I'm absolutely appalled that they're the force they are in the universities</a>
