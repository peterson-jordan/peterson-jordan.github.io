<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h00m16s">Ben and I met about eight months ago, eh? He came up to Toronto and gave a rousing talk and...</a>
00:00:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h00m25s">Talk about political correctness at that point, quite a politically appointed political talk, and I got a couple of questions for you.</a>
00:00:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h00m31s">One is what are you planning to do in 2018?</a>
00:00:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h00m36s">What do you want to see happen in 2018, personally?</a>
00:00:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h00m38s">And what are you aiming at, and why?</a>
00:00:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h00m42s">So I'm aiming at broadening the reach of the the political messages that I espouse and the messages of,</a>
00:00:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h00m50s">I think, personal responsibility and virtue that I try to espouse.</a>
00:00:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h00m53s">I'm also working on a book that I'm really interested in right now about the roots of Western civilization.</a>
00:00:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h00m58s">What is that makes for a happier and more fulfilled Western civilization?</a>
00:00:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h01m02s">What generates purpose for a civilization and for individuals?</a>
00:01:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h01m05s">And why it is that we seem to have lost purpose.</a>
00:01:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h01m07s">Because my general theory is that the reason that we're trying to murder each other</a>
00:01:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h01m10s">politically and the reason that we hate each other so much is that there is a</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h01m14s">purpose-shaped hole in our heart that we are now filling with anger, a tribal anger at each other.</a>
00:01:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h01m18s">And I'm trying to trace back, kind of backtrack, and say okay, where did where did we go wrong?</a>
00:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h01m22s">Where was purpose at, sort of, its high-water mark and why are we now at low ebb?</a>
00:01:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h01m27s">Okay, one of the things that I've found in the discussions that I've had over the last year, especially the public discussions,</a>
00:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h01m35s">public lectures, let's say, is that it seems perfectly possible to</a>
00:01:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h01m40s">make a room go silent by speaking to, especially if it's a room full of young men,</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h01m44s">by speaking to them about responsibility and truth.</a>
00:01:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h01m47s">This has really staggered me because those are not obviously saleable messages.</a>
00:01:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h01m53s">You know, especially for someone who's rather cynical about the fundamental nature of human beings.</a>
00:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h01m57s">I'm not saying that I am, but if you launched a business plan to the typical observers and said,</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h02m04s">"Well, I'm going to base a public movement on the adoption of excess responsibility and the requirement to speak the truth,</a>
00:02:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h02m13s">and that's going to become hyper popular," the probability that people would agree that that's a possibility is pretty much zero.</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h02m20s">So I've been thinking that</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h02m23s">we've spoken about rights for so long and spoken about freedoms for so long, let's say since the early 60s,</a>
00:02:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h02m30s">just essentially speaking, that we've actually left a conceptual hole in our culture.</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h02m36s">And that seems to be akin to the point that you're making with regards to this book.</a>
00:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h02m40s">And now, you mentioned responsibility, and why that specifically?</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h02m45s">Well, I think that what you're talking about is exactly right.</a>
00:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h02m48s">People in the West have seemed to pose rights in direct opposition to duties.</a>
00:02:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h02m54s">So the American founding, particularly, was obsessed with this idea of rights and individual rights.</a>
00:02:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h02m58s">But there was also this corresponding idea of duties that's very clear in founding thinking.</a>
00:02:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h03m02s">George Washington talks about duty. Benjamin Franklin talks about duty.</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h03m05s">The idea was that duty was to be socially generated, not by government, but by society itself.</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h03m10s">By small communities, by churches, by your family.</a>
00:03:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h03m14s">And that that would fill the gap that allowed you to actually have a functioning society of rights.</a>
00:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h03m18s">But we seem to have left duty completely behind.</a>
00:03:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h03m20s">Now it's just all about the rights and not about the duty.</a>
00:03:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h03m22s">And what's happened is that that's collapsed in on itself because the society of only rights and no duties ends up generating duties masquerading as rights.</a>
00:03:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h03m31s">Positive rights that are actually not rights at all, that are actually me imposing a duty on you in order to further</a>
00:03:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h03m36s">my own perception of my rights.</a>
00:03:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h03m38s">And that's I think where we've been going and it's a dark place.</a>
00:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h03m41s">And it creates an enormous amount of opposition.</a>
00:03:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h03m44s">When you say, Jordan, when you talk about the fact that people would not have thought of building a movement on notions of truth and responsibility,</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h03m51s">that's because, I think, for a long time, people just took it for granted that we all agreed on these things.</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h03m55s">But there's been an actual forcible counter movement for</a>
00:03:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h03m59s">generations now, against both truth and responsibility.</a>
00:03:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h04m02s">The idea is there's no objective truth.</a>
00:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h04m04s">It's socially defined. We can make it up as we go along.</a>
00:04:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h04m07s">There's no telos. I talk a lot in the new book about a teleological way of thinking.</a>
00:04:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h04m12s">This idea that you actually have a purpose for which you were created.</a>
00:04:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h04m15s">And that it's your job to fulfill that purpose.</a>
00:04:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h04m18s">And that's completely been left by the wayside, so there's no truth.</a>
00:04:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h04m21s">There's no capacity, even the scientific materialist worldview actually robs you of the capacity to even change yourself.</a>
00:04:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h04m27s">The studies that I've seen suggest that if you believe in a certain form of determinism,</a>
00:04:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h04m30s">if you believe in hard determinism, you're less likely to go out and actually change your life and make it better</a>
00:04:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h04m34s">because you buy into your own philosophy.</a>
00:04:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h04m36s">And I think that as a society, we've sort of bought into that,</a>
00:04:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h04m38s">that we're all victims of our own biology, victims of our own race, victims of our own ethnicity or our situation,</a>
00:04:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h04m43s">and there's no way for us to get out of that.</a>
00:04:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h04m44s">And so we may as well throw up our hands or at least give the power to the only thing that can change things,</a>
00:04:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h04m48s">which is this massive collective that comes in and is the boot stomping on the human face forever.</a>
00:04:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h04m55s">Well, there's also the strange misapprehension,</a>
00:04:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h04m57s">I think, with regards to the nature of rights, because as far as I can tell, rights are a multi-faceted phenomena.</a>
00:04:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h05m06s">But I think the least metaphysical claim that you can make about rights</a>
00:05:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h05m11s">is that if I have a right, then that brings with it a parallel responsibility,</a>
00:05:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h05m16s">not only to myself, to act in a manner that is in accordance with that right, whatever that happens to be,</a>
00:05:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h05m22s">but I also have a responsibility,</a>
00:05:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h05m24s">if the right is universal, to act in a certain manner towards you.</a>
00:05:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h05m28s">Because there is no difference between rights and responsibilities, fundamentally.</a>
00:05:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h05m34s">They're just the mirror image of one another.</a>
00:05:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h05m36s">Now that's to say nothing about their potential metaphysical origin.</a>
00:05:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h05m39s">I don't want to talk about that.</a>
00:05:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h05m40s">But it doesn't seem to me to be logically tenable to have an infinite conversation about rights without having a parallel conversation about responsibility.</a>
00:05:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h05m50s">So there's a logical flaw in it that leaves that gap that needs to be filled.</a>
00:05:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h05m54s">And then the other thing that's occurred to me</a>
00:05:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h05m57s">is that</a>
00:05:57</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h06m02s">I think I could make that claim without even making it metaphysical,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h06m10s">It seems to me that almost all the things that people find meaningful in life that aren't merely impulsive pleasures, which, of course,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h06m31s">What do you think it is that's driven our loss of that half of the conversation? What's happened?</a>
00:06:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h06m39s">So I think that this has been</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h06m46s">Which seems to be the pattern. All the bad stuff from Europe</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h06m52s">I think that what happened here is that the enlightenment mentality was built on certain fundamental premises, including the use of human reason, the capacity for free will.</a>
00:06:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h06m59s">And all of that in turn rested on assumptions about the universe including the idea that the universe has a</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h07m10s">The Aristotelian idea of happiness is very much bound up with the idea of you fulfilling your telos.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h07m24s">the enlightenment project, which started off in an attempt really in the 13th century by people like Aquinas and Maimonides to unite religion and science,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h07m34s">We're seeking the same thing. Religion and science are both seeking universal truths that can be applicable to our own lives and make us more fulfilled.</a>
00:07:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h07m43s">The project of science became to destroy one pole, to destroy religion.</a>
00:07:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h07m47s">And then by doing that, science almost turned in on itself. Reason almost ate itself.</a>
00:07:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h07m50s">So I think reason basically turned into, okay, we're going to follow to the logical end point all of the non-religious bases of human thought.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h09m33s">is that, as far as I can tell, their conduct is full of performative contradictions</a>

00:09:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h09m42s">And in my sense because I'm an existentialist at heart, is that what you believe is what you act out.</a>
00:09:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h09m48s">What you say might be in accordance with that and it might not.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h11m06s">let's say, in his many mythological guises. And there's nature. That's the Great Mother.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h11m10s">And so you could say that that's the biology and society of the modern scientists.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h11m25s">And that independent third factor is something like the Logos that gives rise to being at the beginning of time, right?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h13m26s">I think it's about as good as it got in terms governmental theory.</a>
00:13:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h13m28s">I don't think it's gotten better since then. I think that it's been extended more broadly.</a>
00:13:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h13m32s">I think the Universalism that they were implying has now been applied in many ways, and that's a great thing, right?</a>
00:13:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h13m37s">The founders, obviously, still held slaves, many of them.</a>
00:13:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h13m40s">But their principles were not in favor of slavery.</a>
00:13:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h13m43s">So the principles that they espoused were based on, again, these two competing poles</a>
00:13:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h13m48s">that are constantly in tension with one another in this sort of Leo Strauss-ian tension with one another.</a>
00:13:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h13m52s">Between reason and revelation, the Judeo-Christian tradition and the Greek tradition of reason.</a>
00:13:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h13m57s">And the tug and back and forth is what allows you to have one foot in right and one foot in duties.</a>
00:13:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h14m04s">So it'd be really good to have a lengthy conversation about this at some point,</a>
00:14:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h14m08s">because there's some things in here that really have to be dealt in deeply.</a>
00:14:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h14m12s">The "you have to find your own purpose" argument was one that was put forth very strongly by Nietzsche after he announced the death of God.</a>
00:14:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h14m20s">He said that people would have to revalue good and evil and to come up with their own definitions of what constituted morality.</a>
00:14:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h14m27s">The Nietzschian criticism of Christianity is about as deep as it got, with the possible exception of Dostoyevsky.</a>
00:14:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h14m33s">But there's one of the things I really liked about Carl Jung, and that's really struck me as irrefutable, is</a>
00:14:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h14m41s">Jung's fundamental response to Nietzsche was that, well,</a>
00:14:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h14m46s">let's take the argument of the death of God to its logical conclusion.</a>
00:14:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h14m50s">And then let's investigate the idea that human beings have to be the creators of their own systems of meaning.</a>
00:14:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h14m56s">Jung's idea, and this was also the case for the other psychoanalysts, was that's just palpably false</a>
00:14:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h15m02s">Because it turns out that you're not the sort of creature that can create your own meaning.</a>
00:15:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h15m07s">You're the sort of creature that has to discover the meaning that already exists encoded within you.</a>
00:15:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h15m12s">And part of that is that you're not your own slave.</a>
00:15:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h15m15s">And so it's a critique, not only of the idea that you can will your own destiny in its entirety,</a>
00:15:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h15m21s">while completely ignoring the fact that you have a nature.</a>
00:15:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h15m23s">But it's also a profound critique of the socialist utopian ideas that human beings can be molded in any way that they see fit.</a>
00:15:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h15m30s">And so Jung's objection was something like,</a>
00:15:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h15m33s">well, try to generate a meaning on your own, out of nothing.</a>
00:15:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h15m37s">And then try to force yourself to follow it and see how far you get.</a>
00:15:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h15m41s">What you'll find is that you rebel.</a>
00:15:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h15m44s">Your own nature rebels in every possible way</a>
00:15:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h15m46s">against the arbitrary imposition of a certain--of just any old moral framework on the manner in which you're going to conduct yourself.</a>
00:15:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h15m55s">Yeah, I think this is such a deep critique.</a>
00:15:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h15m57s">And I think that it's so telling because what we've come up with is,</a>
00:15:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h16m01s">the substitute for what you're talking about,</a>
00:16:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h16m03s">which is this acknowledgement that there is a universal purpose that we ought to be aspiring to discover.</a>
00:16:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h16m08s">That it's actually out there.</a>
00:16:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h16m09s">There's a purpose out there, and it's our job to uncover it, as opposed to self creating it.</a>
00:16:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h16m13s">Then that is a really deep divide in America, I think in the West generally, because what people have said is,</a>
00:16:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h16m19s">okay, we finally realized that we do need this thing called purpose, right?</a>
00:16:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h16m21s">We can't just be hedonists all the time. Drugs and sex aren't going to cut it.</a>
00:16:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h16m24s">We're actually gonna need to come up with some purpose...</a>
00:16:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h16m26s">Yeah, they're hydrous.</a>
00:16:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h16m27s">Right, but we're not going to be able to, but at the same time</a>
00:16:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h16m30s">we don't want a government or a society or a church or a community forcing down its universal perception of values on us.</a>
00:16:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h16m38s">And so therefore, our our happy medium is going to be you define your own freedom.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h16m42s">You define your own rights. And you define your own view of the universe.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h16m46s">Well that is always going to just evolve into this pathetic sort of solipsism</a>
00:16:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h16m51s">that can never be escaped from and doesn't provide happiness anyway.</a>
00:16:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h16m55s">I mean, the people who quote-unquote define their own meaning are some of the least happy people that you will ever meet, because</a>
00:16:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h17m00s">they don't believe that they're in consonance with anything larger.</a>

00:17:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h17m06s">There has to be something beyond you, whether you find it in God or whether you find it in a community or in nature.</a>
00:17:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h17m11s">There has to be something that speaks to you beyond the guts that exist inside you, or you're just examining your own intestines.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h17m17s">I think too that you can make a strong scientific case, and this is something I never got to in my discussions with Sam Harris,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h17m24s">is you could make a strong scientific case for the reality of meaning as an...</a>
00:17:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h17m31s">let's just call it for the reality of meaning.</a>
00:17:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h17m34s">You might think about it as a psychological reality,</a>
00:17:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h17m36s">but you can think about it as a metaphysical or a biological reality too.</a>
00:17:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h17m39s">Because as far as I can tell, and there's good neurological evidence for this,</a>
00:17:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h17m44s">your brain is adapted to two modes of being.</a>
00:17:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h17m47s">And one mode of being is that mode that obtains when you're where you know what you're doing</a>
00:17:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h17m52s">and you know what's going on.</a>
00:17:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h17m53s">So you could call that explored territory, let's say.</a>
00:17:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h17m55s">And there's another mode of being that is that which obtains when you don't know what's going on.</a>
00:17:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h18m01s">When you're in unexplored territory.</a>
00:18:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h18m03s">You can say, well, animals since the beginning of time have adapted to some combination of exploring an unexplored territory.</a>
00:18:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h18m09s">And that's roughly akin to known and unknown, which I think is what's symbolized in the yin-yang symbols.</a>
00:18:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h18m14s">And as far as I can tell, the sense of meaning that people experience that's spontaneous and deep</a>
00:18:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h18m21s">is an indication that they're functioning well in exploring territory, but simultaneously Increasing their capacity to deal with unexplored territory.</a>
00:18:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h18m29s">So it's like the zone of proximal development, or even the flow states that Csikszentmihalyi has talked about.</a>
00:18:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h18m35s">But see, the best thing to be is where things are going well for you.</a>
00:18:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h18m40s">But also where you're expanding the capacity of things to go well for you simultaneously.</a>
00:18:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h18m45s">And then you can add to that the fact that that's not going to be solipsistic.</a>
00:18:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h18m49s">Because we live in a social world.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h19m28s">See, to me, I've often thought that the most real thing is pain.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h19m35s">If there's an antidote to pain, that would be something that would be even more real than pain.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h19m40s">And it seems to me that the sense of meaning that I'm talking about here,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h19m43s">that's associated with this sense of ultimate responsibility is an antidote to pain and therefore is something that's most real.</a>
00:19:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h19m50s">I don't see anything- you can make a metaphysical claim about that and that's perfectly reasonable.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h19m55s">But you don't have to. You can make a bloody hardcore scientific claim for that.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h20m16s">This feeling that you have mastery over your capacity to explore the unexplored.</a>
00:20:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h20m21s">And that the unexplored is worth is worth exploring, right?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h20m23s">I mean, that's the other thing, is that what drives you to to explore the unexplored?</a>
00:20:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h20m27s">It's not just that you get up in the morning and you feel like wandering outside into the forest.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h20m32s">There's some of that.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h20m32s">But I think some of it is that you feel like there's an actual necessity for you as a human being to do that.</a>
00:20:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h20m36s">There's a moral duty for you to try and conquer new worlds.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h20m39s">And adding the moral layer, the moral impetus on top of,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h20m42s">I just have a decision to go out and explore unexplored territory is what I think</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h20m55s">You know, what people call "toxic masculinity" and all this nonsense.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h20m58s">And the binary nature, I think, of human beings, particularly men, is that men,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h21m05s">because I have a little boy who's a year and a half old, and he's either he's either building a stack of blocks or he's destroying the stack of blocks.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h21m10s">There is no in-between and so if you're exploring unexplored territory,</a>
00:21:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h21m14s">They're only two ways to deal with that one is to actually take a fire and set it in the unexplored territory or the other</a>
00:21:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h21m19s">Is to cultivate that unexplored territory and adding that moral layer of it's your job</a>
00:21:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h21m24s">to forge out into the universe and make that cultivated territory, to bring that into the known that adding that moral dimension is I think</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h21m31s">what both the Greeks and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h21m37s">Christian but the idea that there is a God worth exploring and that God has reached down to man and uplifted him is is I</a>
00:21:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h21m42s">think relevant to Judeo-Christian religion</a>
00:21:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h21m45s">And is really the essence of Judeo-Christian religion.  Iif you look at polytheism</a>
00:21:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h21m48s">That notion that you're out there to try and understand God</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h21m51s">It doesn't it doesn't exist in polytheistic religion the notion that you're supposed to look beyond</a>
00:21:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h21m55s">Your you're supposed to look beyond yourself to a broader understanding of the universe</a>
00:21:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h21m59s">No</a>
00:21:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h21m59s">You were subject to forces in the universe right and those were represented by the different gods not this idea that there's a universal system</a>
00:21:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h22m05s">That's that's at least partially knowable that if you spend your life trying to investigate and live in consonance with you will be happier</a>
00:22:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h22m11s">That's a lot closer to the Greek system</a>
00:22:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h22m12s">Which is why you ends up with this common idea of the Logos that you talk about being in the book of John.</a>
00:22:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h22m17s">But also really springing from from Greek thought. I mean that's that's that's the idea there. Right, right.</a>
00:22:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h22m21s">Yes an unbelievably brilliant synthesis. No you-you-you</a>
00:22:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h22m25s">touched on the idea of cultivation</a>
00:22:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h22m27s">So I wanted to ask you about that</a>
00:22:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h22m28s">I'm going to Amsterdam to talk to you this event at this event sponsored by a group called the Dutch lion</a>
00:22:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h22m34s">And that's going to happen January 19th</a>
00:22:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h22m37s">and we've got about 2,000 people attending this event and it's going to be a national discussion about</a>
00:22:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h22m43s">Dutch and European identity and immigration and</a>
00:22:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h22m46s">So in principle it could be a big deal and one of the things I've been meditating on is what it is that</a>
00:22:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h22m53s">Western civilization got right and</a>
00:22:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h22m56s">so the first thing I think is that we got the idea of the Logos right that's a big deal the sovereignty of the</a>
00:22:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h23m01s">individual and the sovereignty and the necessity for respect of the capacity of the</a>
00:23:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h23m07s">Exploring individual to conquer new territory and make it habitable.  We got that right and so and I mean fundamentally right, but then</a>
00:23:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h23m15s">That seems also to me to tie interestingly into the idea of property rights because the fundamental Marxist claim</a>
00:23:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h23m22s">There's a number of them</a>
00:23:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h23m23s">but one of the most fundamental</a>
00:23:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h23m24s">claims is that</a>
00:23:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h23m25s">property is in some sense theft and so that might even mean the property that you accrued as a consequence of being successful</a>
00:23:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h23m31s">and I think it might be worth giving the devil his due and say well are there conditions under which my</a>
00:23:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h23m39s">occupation of a space to the exclusion of you isn't merely theft and the idea of cultivation I think is exactly the right</a>
00:23:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h23m47s">Answer to that</a>
00:23:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h23m48s">Is that the point is for each of us to allow the other to</a>
00:23:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h23m53s">occupy a particular place and time</a>
00:23:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h23m55s">In the hopes that we'll each take care of it for our own benefit and for the benefit of others</a>
00:23:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h24m00s">And then what happens is that everyone wins</a>
00:24:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h24m03s">Yeah, and this is a very obviously Lockean idea, right?</a>
00:24:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h24m06s">This is this is Locke's idea of what makes property worthwhile and property rights worth well as you mix your labor with the land and</a>
00:24:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h24m11s">You cultivated it</a>
00:24:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h24m12s">Which is why Locke specifically talks about the notion of adverse possession right if I own a piece of property?</a>
00:24:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h24m17s">And I just decided to leave it trashed</a>
00:24:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h24m19s">Somewhere and then someone comes in and cultivates the property even though I own the property</a>
00:24:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h24m23s">I should have a good legal case to actually make against that owner because I'm not cultivating the property the idea being that</a>
00:24:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h24m28s">Cultivation and use of the land is actually your individual duty. It's your individual duty</a>
00:24:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h24m33s">There's also your communal duty</a>
00:24:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h24m34s">So I think the moral legitimacy of property rights is you know in in Locke's thought particularly is very much tied to</a>
00:24:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h24m42s">Cultivation and your personal stake in what you've done with with the property that you own again</a>
00:24:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h24m48s">It's exactly your point that there's a mix of rights to these property rights our linkage of duties. It's not just props go be owned</a>
00:24:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h24m53s">Okay, so maybe we can close with this</a>
00:24:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h24m55s">You know the the idea of a garden is very interesting to me and of course the natural</a>
00:24:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h24m59s">Environment of the human being is the garden according to Genesis right it's the Garden of Eden</a>
00:24:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h25m04s">And I've thought for a long time, "Well, Why is it a garden?" And the answer to that is that a garden is the optimal</a>
00:25:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h25m11s">Juxtaposition of nature and culture. Right, so a garden is nature</a>
00:25:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h25m15s">Blooming of its own accord, but tended very carefully and so then the rule would be something like you're allowed</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h25m33s">Right I think it's true, and I think that's true in every area of a successful life</a>
00:25:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h25m36s">It's true with how you raise your children</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h25m37s">Yeah, you lose the right to raise your children properly if you're raising your children improperly</a>
00:25:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h25m41s">I think it's true of marriage marriages break down when you don't cultivate</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h25m44s">cultivation is the the ultimate human need is cultivation and</a>
00:25:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h25m48s">When we cultivate whether it's in the realm of knowledge or science or whether it's in the realm of religion and relationships</a>
00:25:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h25m53s">then we are happier and when we don't cultivate and we and when we deprive ourselves of the capacity and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h25m59s">Both the capacity and the purpose of cultivation, then everything falls into anarchy, then then just through entropy everything will fall apart, I think.</a>
00:25:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kteHW6t4G0g#t=00h26m06s">Ok, ok, so the right objection to "privilege" is cultivation. It's like. I'm not privileged. I'm cultivating</a>
