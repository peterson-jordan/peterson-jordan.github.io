<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-wWBGo6a2w#t=01h33m43s">It can be said that there is a heaven at the beginning of time</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-wWBGo6a2w#t=01h34m08s">Because it was not a book when it was written</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-wWBGo6a2w#t=01h34m22s">The question is what this story tells</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-wWBGo6a2w#t=01h34m33s">I mentioned this before</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-wWBGo6a2w#t=01h34m35s">The idea of ​​formulating the image of God is an abstraction</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-wWBGo6a2w#t=01h34m43s">Because I said before</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-wWBGo6a2w#t=01h34m49s">I want to say that I know the evidence of true religious experience</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-wWBGo6a2w#t=01h34m58s">So i won't explain it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-wWBGo6a2w#t=01h35m00s">I want to treat it as a fact</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-wWBGo6a2w#t=01h35m03s">For example, we first treat it as a fact and a mystery</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-wWBGo6a2w#t=01h35m07s">Then we have to look at it from a rational perspective</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-wWBGo6a2w#t=01h35m11s">Another example is the initial formulation of the concept of God</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-wWBGo6a2w#t=01h35m13s">Is an attempt to abstract the ideal model</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-wWBGo6a2w#t=01h35m16s">Then we consider it as an abstract consideration outside of realisation</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-wWBGo6a2w#t=01h35m22s">That's good enough</a>
