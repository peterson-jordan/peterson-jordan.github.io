00:01:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h01m46s">and generated a lot of media interest,

00:01:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h01m53s">and also, you know, counter support; it's a

00:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h01m57s">now? JBP: Well, I would certainly say that the

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h02m27s">resulted in the university sending me
two warning letters; taking me to task</a>
00:02:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h02m32s">for my announced refusal to use made-up

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h02m38s">pronouns, like Ze, and Zir, yet I felt were

what they are. Normally speaking with the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h02m51s">disciplinary process; you get three
letters and then something more final</a>
00:02:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h02m56s">and determining happens, but the
university stopped with at the second</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h03m00s">letter, and it wasn't obvious
for a few months whether I would be able</a>
00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h03m05s">to continue teaching, but in no small

00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h03m12s">support that I received from journalists
throughout Canada, and then from the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h03m17s">general public, as well, the university
has...the university was responding to</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h03m24s">public pressure; let's say both ways, you
know when they first sent me the warning</a>
00:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h03m29s">letters. That happened as a consequence of their</a>
00:03:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h03m32s">consultations with their lawyers, but
also because there was internal pressure</a>
00:03:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h03m36s">on the administration brought to bear by
these professional social justice</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h03m41s">warrior activists types, who are
unbelievably good at that. It's all they</a>
00:03:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h03m45s">do. And so when that was counterbalanced
by public outrage; I would say the</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h03m52s">university responded to that, as well, and
decided politely, I would say, and I'm</a>
00:03:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h03m59s">saying this without rancor-anger. I mean
the people that I was dealing with were</a>
00:03:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h04m04s">by no means, evil people or malevolent
people. They were administrators trying</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h04m16s">Whatever that might be,
now, you can debate about whether or not</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h04m20s">that's the best way to handle such
things, but it doesn't matter; I started</a>
00:04:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h04m24s">teaching again in January.
I do all my teaching in the first</a>
00:04:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h04m27s">semester, and so I wasn't teaching
undergraduates in the fall. It's just my</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h04m32s">graduate students, and doing my research,
and so on. But I started again in January,</a>
00:04:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h04m37s">and I was very nervous about that. I
didn't know what would happen if there</a>
00:04:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h04m42s">would be more protests, or if there would
be people trying to back me into a</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h04m47s">corner, and give me a rough time. But what
happened was that the students were</a>
00:04:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h04m51s">exceptionally welcoming, and they've been
very positively inclined towards me, and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h04m59s">happy to be in my classes. And so that
calmed me down fairly quickly, and I</a>
00:04:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h05m06s">would say apart from the fact that I now

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h12m56s">for a very long time, and so you look at

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h13m01s">you describe that lens to someone else,
you're basically telling them a story.</a>
00:13:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h13m06s">People really like listening to
stories because we like the opportunity</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h13m12s">to have multiple lenses, because they
serve a different function which is</a>
00:13:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h13m17s">probably why it's so useful to listen to
people who don't agree with you because</a>
00:13:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h13m21s">they might tell you something you don't

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h13m25s">you talk to people who agree with you

source was the observation that people</a>

And so it's a psychoanalytic idea in</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h13m41s">part that you act out the story of your

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h14m22s">So then the next piece of the puzzle was

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h15m07s">was curative, and so Pennebaker decided
to now there's something about that</a>
00:15:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h15m12s">that's true, even though I think Freud's
formulation was flawed. A flawed</a>
00:15:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h15m18s">formulation that moves you in the right
direction is a lot better than no</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h15m21s">formulation at all. Okay, so
Pennebaker decided to put this to the</a>
00:15:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h15m25s">test, and so what he did was bring
university students in and had them write</a>
00:15:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h15m30s">15 minutes a day, three days in a row,
about the worst thing that</a>
00:15:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h15m35s">ever happened to them. A control
group just wrote about the things they</a>
00:15:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h15m39s">did that day, and what Pennebaker found
was that over multi-month follow-up</a>
00:15:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h15m44s">period the students who engaged in that,
call it expressive writing, because he</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h15m50s">was working on the catharsis model at
that time. Their health improved, they</a>
00:15:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h15m54s">visited the doctor less frequently, and
Pennebaker was very curious about why</a>
00:15:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h16m00s">that occurred, and so he went back into
the writings of those whose health had</a>
00:16:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h16m05s">improved the most and coded the words
they used, and he coded words for</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h16m11s">emotional expression, so that would be
the catharsis hypothesis.</a>
00:16:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h16m16s">But he also coded them for indications
of cognitive transformation like, "Well, I</a>
00:16:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h16m21s">now realize," or "I've come to understand,"
or that "I now know,", or "I can now see," and</a>
00:16:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h16m27s">what he found was the emotional words
didn't predict improvement, but the</a>
00:16:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h16m32s">cognitive words did. And so his
hypothesis was that the reformulation of</a>
00:16:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h16m41s">a traumatic or uncertain event into an

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h16m50s">stress load on the person. So a way of
thinking about that is imagine that your</a>
00:16:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h16m55s">brain is trying to compute how stressed
you should be, and it wants to know it</a>
00:16:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h17m00s">wants to make you as stressed as the
situation is dangerous, and so you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h17m05s">might say, "Well, how dangerous is your

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnhLl1Wyeg#t=00h17m14s">should be really stressed, because you're
