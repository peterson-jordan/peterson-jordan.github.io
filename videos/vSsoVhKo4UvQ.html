<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h00m30s">Probably part of the answer is that it is not clear or studying personality</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h01m11s">The problem with reading one study after another is that you only see a small part of the domain at a time.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h01m18s">Often times it is difficult to understand because, in order to understand the results of a study, you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h01m30s">That framework is developed by studying the relevant scientific</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h01m38s">Subsequently, that framework must be expanded to include the relevant philosophical assumptions.</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h01m45s">I don't think you can understand the details without understanding the assumptions.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h03m11s">In a way, it's easy to understand people when you've already decided what they value.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h03m26s">It's a profound question, because it's not clear at all whether the question:</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h05m39s">I think I told you when we studied Jung that Jung said, “People don't have ideas,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h05m49s">One of Jung's, in a sense, lasting contributions is that you need to know what ideas</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h07m02s">One reason was that it was pretty clear, not just that World War II was an ideological struggle</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h15m33s">I think there are several reasons why it is relevant.</a>
00:15:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h15m37s">The first observation may be that many mental illnesses, this is an existentialist claim,</a>
00:15:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h15m44s">stems from nihilism.</a>
00:15:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h15m47s">When someone who is depressed comes to visit you, you often hear: "I experience life as meaningless."</a>
00:15:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h15m54s">But that's not what they mean.</a>
00:15:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h15m56s">What they mean is that they see the meaning of life as suffering, which is also a meaning, isn't it?</a>
00:15:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h16m03s">And that is not bearable.</a>
00:16:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h16m04s">Then the question becomes, "Why bother?"</a>
00:16:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h16m09s">That is the basic question of suicide.</a>
00:16:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h16m11s">It's a philosophical question.</a>
00:16:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h16m13s">I think it was Camus who said that was the only real philosophical question</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h16m19s">That's a bit dark, maybe Camus could use some antidepressants,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h16m26s">And I think it is inappropriate to discuss depression with someone who is depressed,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h16m46s">Why live when there is suffering?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h16m48s">Well, that's one problem. If you find it difficult to get into your life</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h17m03s">The reason is that many of the things you will have to do will be difficult,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h17m11s">The existentialists do not claim the same as Freud.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h17m15s">Freud states that a normal person is in a sense sane,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h17m35s">But the existentialist would say, “No, wait a minute.</a>
00:17:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h17m39s">Perhaps the basic situation of people is nihilism and suffering,</a>
00:17:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h17m46s">and something must be built up to counteract that, so that life becomes bearable. ”</a>
00:17:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h17m52s">That seems to me to be a very reasonable proposition.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h17m55s">It is a strange statement because I have seen people in my life who have been tormented</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h18m15s">And I've seen other people who never seem to raise those questions.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h18m18s">I think those people are conservative people, not very open</a>
00:18:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h18m26s">and probably not very neurotic.</a>

00:18:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h18m39s">But there are plenty of people in that other category.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h18m51s">Nihilism and atheism are closely related.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h18m52s">They are certainly not identical.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h18m56s">Although I think it is difficult for atheism to describe why it is not essentially nihilistic.</a>
00:18:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h19m02s">That is Dostoevsky's great criticism.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h19m05s">Dostoevsky argued that if one does not assume a fundamental value, there is no reason</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h19m18s">All of Dostoevsky's novels are an exploration of that idea.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoVhKo4UvQ#t=00h19m25s">Sometimes it is an exploration of what that idea would mean if lived</a>
