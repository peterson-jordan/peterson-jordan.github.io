<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=00h54m47s">but you know they're a little on the

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h04m31s">exploration and a bit of manifestation

01:04:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h04m35s">and so that's what's happening here with
a little you know the baboon and the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h04m40s">tree and the and the drawing so anyways
he knows that Simba is alive now</a>
01:04:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h04m43s">and so he goes off to find him and
meanwhile Simba and his dopey companions</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h04m52s">should meet bugs for crying out loud but
they're easy and so you see this scene</a>
01:04:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h04m56s">where Pumbaa goes after this bug and

01:05:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h05m07s">because one of the things that happens I
suppose you could think about this one</a>
01:05:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h05m12s">of the things that happens in late
adolescence is that the formation of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h05m22s">that gang to get involved in an

01:05:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h05m26s">the idea that the female lion is the

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h05m32s">that will devour the group is exactly
right and so what a girl will do often</a>
01:05:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h05m38s">if she's in relationship with you know
somebody like a young man or an older</a>
01:05:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h05m43s">adolescent is she'll try to separate him

01:05:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h05m47s">wonder you know why wouldn't she do that
because he does have dopey friends and</a>
01:05:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h05m51s">it'd be better for him if he could get
beyond them and so anyways they're</a>
01:05:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h05m55s">pretty freaked out about this and so
then Simba goes out and has a fight with</a>
01:05:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h06m00s">this lion to protect his dopey chums and
I'm sure you don't need any explanation</a>
01:06:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h06m04s">about what that means and they have this
huge fight and neljä who it turns out to</a>
01:06:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h06m10s">be pins him and so that goes back to the
beginning of the story where when he</a>
01:06:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h06m15s">first encountered her she pinned him all
the time she's an animal figure right</a>
01:06:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h06m19s">and now what she does immediately is
shame him so she he's an atom a figure</a>
01:06:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h06m25s">in part she's an animal figure in part
because she actually does shame him</a>
01:06:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h06m28s">right so she's the gateway to higher
consciousness she makes him</a>
01:06:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h06m32s">self-conscious and rightly so but he's
also a she's also a psychological figure</a>
01:06:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h06m37s">because he imagined that when a young
man is establishing a relationship with</a>
01:06:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h06m41s">a young woman and he's he's enamored of
her he's falling in love he projects an</a>
01:06:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h06m46s">idea onto her and that ideal is going to
be partially fulfilled by the</a>
01:06:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h06m49s">relationship the degree to which is
unspecified and sometimes it'll collapse</a>
01:06:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h06m53s">completely but he projects an ideal on
to her because otherwise he wouldn't be</a>
01:06:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h06m57s">attracted to her and then the ideal
judges him and so that makes him feel</a>
01:06:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h07m01s">all self-conscious and and useful
which is useful because he is useless</a>
01:07:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h07m06s">and should feel that way and so it's
part of the impetus to growing up so and</a>
01:07:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h07m12s">of course one of the you need necessity
in order to mature you because to mature</a>
01:07:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h07m18s">is to take on responsibility and you're
not going to feel that impetus unless</a>
01:07:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h07m23s">adopting the responsibility has some
sort of payoff and women tend to mate</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h07m28s">across an up dominance hierarchy so they
tend to actually like men who are useful</a>
01:07:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h07m32s">and so if they encounter a man who isn't
useful at all they're gonna that's</a>
01:07:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h07m37s">exactly what's going to happen they're
gonna not be happy about that in the</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h07m42s">least and so and no wonder and I think
the reason for that it's an economic and</a>
01:07:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h07m47s">a biological reason the reason is is
that women are in the position of having</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h07m57s">a woman who's extraordinarily competent

01:08:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h08m08s">and you're not gonna pick up part of the

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h08m12s">it's in the woman's best interest not to

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h08m19s">anyway she pins him and then he's all
resentful about it immediately because</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h08m23s">she's calling him on his stupid friends

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h08m47s">whole situation there the animators do a

01:08:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h08m52s">because one of the things you see is
that his eyebrows are always pointing up</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h17m18s">goes through this horrifying underground

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h17m22s">tangled up which is you know if you ever

01:17:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h17m32s">horrifying music going on in the

01:17:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h17m35s">until Rafiki says he finds a pool in the

01:17:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h17m41s">that's another symbol of the self it's
it's the deep unconscious to something</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h17m45s">down there that's alive that can be
drawn up to the surface and so Rafiki</a>
01:17:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h17m50s">shows him the pool and Simba who's quite
terrified at this point looks in it and</a>
01:17:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h17m55s">the first thing he sees is he only sees
himself he only sees his own reflection</a>
01:17:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h17m59s">and Rafiki says look deeper now you see
what the animators do here it's very</a>
01:17:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h18m04s">cool
so there's Simba and there's his</a>
01:18:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h18m07s">reflection but you see that is already
half is farther and you look at the</a>
01:18:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h18m11s">difference in the eyebrows and the
so there's a there's a tightness of jaw</a>
01:18:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h18m16s">and a firmness of face that's starting
to manifest itself there and that means</a>
01:18:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h18m21s">that he's starting to see the man he
could be beyond the adolescent that's a</a>
01:18:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h18m26s">good way of thinking about it and then
all of a sudden well they're you know</a>
01:18:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h18m28s">that's a whole different face right
that's a seriously different face that</a>
01:18:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h18m34s">everything's going in and that it's like
get out of my way because things are</a>
01:18:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h18m38s">going to happen around me very
judgmental as well so it's not it's not</a>
01:18:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h18m42s">naive by any stretch of the imagination
but you know we know as far there's a</a>
01:18:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h18m47s">good guy and so there's something
archetypal about this and so he sees the</a>
01:18:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h18m51s">man he could be reflected back to him
and then that's which is that actually</a>
01:18:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h18m55s">becomes a cosmic event and we switch up
to the sky instead</a>
01:18:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h18m59s">and so Mufasa manifests himself
basically as a solar deity and he tells</a>
01:18:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h19m07s">Simba that he's forgotten who he is
which is the son of a king and that he</a>
01:19:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h19m13s">should remember that and start acting
like it</a>
01:19:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h19m16s">and that's an archetypal idea so if
you're just a useless adolescent then</a>
01:19:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h19m22s">you've forgotten who you are and the
consequence of that is that the state is</a>
01:19:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h19m26s">going to fall around fall apart around

01:19:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h19m32s">able to rely on you and you're gonna be
all whiny and resentful and then after</a>
01:19:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h19m36s">that it even gets worse and so that's
basically what Mufasa tells him and so</a>
01:19:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h19m41s">Simba is like blown away by this vision
right because he sees what he could be</a>
01:19:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h19m46s">and also what he's not which is pretty
damn horrifying so anyways the storm so</a>
01:19:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h19m54s">to speak clears and Rafiki comes up and
and Simba's a lot more thoughtful and</a>
01:19:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h19m59s">not quite as whiny and resentful anymore
and Rafiki leaves and so Simba now knows</a>
01:19:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h20m06s">what he's supposed to do he's supposed
to stop being useless and take on the</a>
01:20:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h20m10s">moral requirements of setting the
Kingdom straight and so he runs back</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h20m16s">across the desert there's all sorts of

01:20:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h20m20s">comes back to his kingdom and it's not
looking so good and that's the</a>
01:20:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h20m24s">consequence of his his abandonment of it
that's a big</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h20m27s">part of it so now it's dead but also his
abandonment of it - nothing but</a>
01:20:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h20m32s">malevolence and chaos and so he's pretty
taken aback and what's happened and that</a>
01:20:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h20m38s">he exaggerates his guilt or it should
anyways and neljä shows up and and they</a>
01:20:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h20m46s">decide they're gonna do something about
this so in the meantime</a>
01:20:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h20m51s">Simba's mother is complaining about the

they can and Skaar doesn't want to hear</a>
01:20:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h20m58s">this so he he attacks her and Simba
decides to go to war and so this is</a>
01:20:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h21m05s">where he wakes up and he's willing to
encounter the shadow at this point and</a>
01:21:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h21m10s">so he confronts scar and scars very
concerned about this because actually</a>
01:21:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h21m15s">Simba is looking pretty impressive now

01:21:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h21m19s">so he tries to use treachery and whiny
Nessun and subordination to excuse</a>
01:21:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h21m26s">himself but he's planning to overthrow

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h21m33s">tells scar to leave he's going to banish

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h21m38s">kingdom like scar did to him and scar
basically refuses and then a storm</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h21m52s">another kind of descent into hell seen
here very common in Disney movies this</a>
01:21:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h21m56s">this this notion of the hero fighting
the evil force on the edge of something</a>
01:21:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h22m01s">that's burning it's quite a common motif
you see it in Sleeping Beauty for</a>
01:22:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h22m03s">example so they have a big war and scar
ends up putting Simba in the same</a>
01:22:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h22m09s">position that Mufasa was in and then he
whispers to him that he killed his</a>
01:22:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h22m13s">father so Simba has been thinking all
along that it was only his fault and it</a>
01:22:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h22m17s">is sort of his fault but he didn't know
that there was a more archetypal theme</a>
01:22:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h22m21s">playing out in the background which is
that societies are always endangered by</a>
01:22:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h22m26s">malevolence always and that's
independent to some degree of Simba's</a>
01:22:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h22m30s">decisions and his and his lack thereof
anyways scar tells him because he thinks</a>
01:22:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h22m34s">he's won and that energizes Simba to
have this sort of final battle he leaps</a>
01:22:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h22m40s">out from the
and they have a big fight and he pins</a>
01:22:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h22m45s">him basically and the female lioness has
come to his aid and Simba tells him that</a>
01:22:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h22m52s">again that he has to leave and so they
have a big fight that's a particularly</a>
01:22:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h22m56s">good bit of animation so there's real
demonic aspect to scar they're sort of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h23m01s">King of Hell imagery and but he loses
and then ha he blames his minions he</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h23m09s">blames the hyenas for everything
terrible this happening forgetting that</a>
01:23:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h23m11s">they can hear him and then he falls off
the cliff and the hyenas go in and</a>
01:23:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h23m15s">finish him off
so it's pretty brutal ending for poor</a>

then scars dead and Simba has one and so</a>
01:23:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h23m27s">the rains come immediately and so what
does that mean well it means that when</a>
01:23:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h23m30s">proper order is restored in a kingdom

01:23:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h23m33s">and so the rains come and then while
it's raining Simba climbs up to the top</a>
01:23:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h23m42s">of the rock and now he's completely
mature right that the facial the</a>
01:23:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h23m46s">pathetic facial expression disappears

01:23:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h23m49s">because now he's full of serotonin after
having defeated good old scar and all</a>
01:23:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h23m54s">the lionesses are roaring and he climbs
up Pride Rock and they roar at him which</a>
01:23:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h24m00s">is good they're tough and he's tough and
they showing their teeth it's it's not</a>
01:24:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h24m03s">it's not a society of naive and harmless
creatures it's it's something that's got</a>
01:24:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h24m10s">some bite and the rains come and then
the next thing you see is the</a>
01:24:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h24m15s">restoration of the kingdom and so
basically that what that means is that</a>
01:24:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h24m19s">if the individual is willing to confront

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h24m28s">restored and everyone can do well and so
then we have a return to the beginning</a>
01:24:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h24m33s">right and so Simba and nella are now a
couple along with Pumbaa and Timon and</a>
01:24:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h24m41s">they have a baby and Rafiki shows up and
does the same thing you know he's gonna</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h24m57s">end of the movie so that's all packed</a>
01:24:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h25m05s">that's all packed into an archetypal

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h27m23s">if if there are these archetypes why
don't we just tell the archetype over</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h27m26s">and over why do we need fiction for

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h27m30s">there's individuals here and the

01:27:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h27m37s">you want is a story that's archetypal so
that you understand its basic structure</a>
01:27:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h27m41s">but you want enough variation and

01:27:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h27m45s">interesting and also applicable to you
so you have to humanize the archetype to</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h27m49s">some degree otherwise it's so abstract
you can't you can't relate to it and and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h27m53s">good stories really do that they bridge

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h27m57s">personal and less archetypal but if
they're completely non archetypal</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h28m02s">there's nothing about them that captures
you it doesn't have any force and then</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h28m06s">if it's two archetypal well it gets to
be too abstract and you can't relate to</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h28m09s">it so good fiction writers and and good
purveyors of dramatic entertainment we</a>
01:28:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h28m15s">think about it as entertainment are

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h28m18s">position so yeah and they reveal the

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6pbJTqv2hw#t=01h37m47s">so so now then imagine that there's

you have a competition between men the</a>
