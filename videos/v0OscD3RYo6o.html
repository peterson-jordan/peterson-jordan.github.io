00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h00m02s">And there's just no getting them out of it so and that's because you know at any given moment. [this] is like</a>
00:00:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h00m07s">It's like field theory there used to be psychological theories that talked about the field of human experience something like that</a>
00:00:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h00m13s">and this is kind of what that is this is a field and</a>
00:00:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h00m16s">Basically what happens is you parse out a little part of the world</a>
00:00:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h00m20s">say and</a>
00:00:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h00m22s">so</a>
00:00:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h00m23s">Amount you can handle  let's say it has me duration. You're not aiming at mething 50 years in the future</a>
00:00:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h00m29s">It's because how the hell are you going to do that. There's too many variables</a>
00:00:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h00m32s">You know so you're aiming at some handleable amount of time and you</a>
00:00:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h00m37s">Posit a goal in there, and you plot your route and then that tells you</a>
00:00:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h00m41s">What's up?</a>
00:00:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h00m42s">and tells you what's down because up moves you towards the goal and down moves you away from the goal and that sets up your</a>
00:00:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h00m48s">Motivation framework so that you have some worth detaining</a>
00:00:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h00m51s">You know that's a really interesting thing to know too - it's like why have a goal? Well, it's easy. No goal</a>
00:00:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h00m58s">No positive emotions</a>
00:00:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h01m01s">Because you experience positive emotion by noticing that you're moving towards a goal, and so you don't have a goal</a>
00:01:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h01m07s">Well, you can't have any positive emotion. So you better have a goal, and so you might say well</a>
00:01:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h01m13s">What should the goal be?</a>
00:01:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h01m15s">Well, we could start by saying well any goal is better than none, and then we might say well</a>
00:01:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h01m20s">it should be a goal that other people will let you pursue because otherwise it's going to be kind of difficult and maybe they'll be</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h01m26s">Even happy to help you pursue it that would even be better</a>
00:01:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h01m29s">And maybe it's a goal that would enable you to learn how to pursue other goals while you pursue that goal</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h01m35s">Boy, that would really be good and so you can see that your goal is parameterised</a>
00:01:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h01m40s">But that doesn't mean that any old goal works it means there's some goals that work</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h01m45s">Nicely and some not so nicely there are playable games and non playable games</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h01m49s">That's a good way of thinking about it, and you want to have a playable game</a>
00:01:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h01m52s">And there's a lot of them lawyer, plumber, you know</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h01m57s">Actor, whatever, they're your playable games and and it's not obvious which one's better</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h02m03s">But it's certainly obvious</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h02m05s">Which ones are sustainable in which ones are worth?</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h02m07s">So there's a set of playable games, and you need to extract from that set of playable games</a>
00:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h02m13s">Game it suits you and that would be partly due to your temperament</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h02m16s">you know because extroverted people want to play an extroverted game and</a>
00:02:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h02m20s">highly neurotic people want to play a safe game and agreeable people want to play a generous game and</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h02m26s">Disagreeable people want to play a game that's highly competitive so they can win, and you know fine, but they're all</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h02m33s">within the realm of playable games and that means they're socially acceptable as well, and so that means it isn't just</a>
00:02:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h02m42s">arbitrary, it isn't just relative what you decide to do. It's heavily parameterised. There's only</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h02m49s">There's a set of playable games, and it's large the set is large, but it there are commonalities within it</a>
00:02:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h02m56s">And that's why there are commonalities</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h02m58s">That's why morality has a common basis</a>
00:02:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h03m01s">Fundamentally, and so that's partly what we're trying to investigate is like</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h03m05s">What's up? What is up mean? What does it mean? Is there such a thing?</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h03m09s">Now one thing to remember is that</a>
00:03:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h03m13s">If you don't erect a hierarchical structure with something to aim at, you got no positive motivation</a>
00:03:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h03m20s">Because you experience positive motivation in relationship to a goal not from attaining the goal. That's satisfaction</a>
00:03:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h03m27s">besides it's fleeting, you know perfectly well. You graduate from university poof next day you have a problem</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h03m33s">Which is what do you do next and that's a tough problem</a>
00:03:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h03m37s">It's not like you've solved your problems by winning that game. You just introduce the problem of having to introduce another game</a>
00:03:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h03m44s">So, it's unreliable as a source of positive emotion, but what's reliable is you set a goal</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h03m49s">And you try to attain it, and then that gives your life that</a>
00:03:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h03m54s">literally</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h03m56s">Provides your life with meaning. That's what meaning is now</a>
00:03:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h03m59s">It's more than that, but that's that's what it is, and so then you might ask yourself well</a>
00:03:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h04m04s">What's a really good goal?</a>
00:04:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OscD3RYo6o#t=00h04m07s">Well, that's what we're trying to figure out. </a>
