00:01:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h01m17s">And in particular to frame that for people who might be listening this conversation at that time</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h01m50s">But the first thing I'd say is I was concerned at the time</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h01m54s">That you and I had had a very long conversation that it might be too long for people when we put it on the website</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h02m04s">They will listen to it. You're absolutely right young people looking for content</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h02m35s">and I mean one of the things that seems to be the case with these people on YouTube that are making a</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h02m47s">they fully they have full respect for the or the intelligence of their audience and they don't pull any punches in terms of content or</a>

00:02:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h02m56s">but but as I say, you know</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h02m58s">It's just extraordinary I pull up in a fuel station out in a country town near where I live</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h03m12s">he said I've just been listening to you and Jordan Peterson having a conversation and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h03m17s">Everywhere I go now. That's what people say. So thank you for the opportunity. You made the comment there though there for every youtube</a>
00:03:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h03m24s">Visit they'd be up to 11 podcasts. I think that's what you said</a>
00:03:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h03m28s">well</a>
00:03:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h03m29s">the podcast market is absolutely exploding and you're actually sitting seeing this start to affect book publishing because</a>
00:03:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h03m36s">audio books have become extraordinarily popular and people are discovering that they can use their found time when they're commuting or</a>
00:03:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h03m44s">Exercising or walking or doing dishes whatever to engage themselves in high quality. Um</a>
00:03:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h03m51s">well high quality educational material books and podcasts and so that's a real revolution it and it really is a</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h03m58s">So these are the people young people too, you know instead of listening to music</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h04m02s">Which is really something because musics being a predominant cultural force for a very long time</a>
00:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h04m07s">So it's an it's an amazing technological revolution and I really appreciate it or a conversation by the way</a>
00:04:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h04m13s">I think we had a great conversation</a>
00:04:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h04m15s">I enjoyed it immensely</a>
00:04:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h04m16s">And it seems to me that this is a sort of modern version and and I think this is terrific if I'm understanding it correctly</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h04m22s">Or the old idea where people who have perhaps had another great formal education had access to good quality</a>
00:04:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h04m28s">Literature and so forth put together by whether it was penguin or what. Was it every man's book</a>
00:04:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h04m32s">So every everyday books whatever they were called even Reader's Digest</a>
00:04:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h04m36s">To make that education that learning the classics and so forth available widely</a>
00:04:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h04m40s">And now this is a modern version of it perhaps and I think what's happening with the mainstream mean?</a>
00:04:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h04m49s">that they underestimate the</a>
00:04:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h04m52s">Moral quality of their viewers, they underestimate their intelligence. They underestimate their persistence and</a>
00:04:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h04m58s">they've also become quite manipulative in their use of editing and and message</a>
00:04:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h05m03s">Massaging spin really and the other thing that's really good about these sorts of conversations</a>
00:05:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h05m08s">Is that what you see is what you get their bare bones</a>
00:05:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h05m11s">They're they're not high-tech while they are and their highest tech in some sense, but not on the production end or the editing end</a>
00:05:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h05m18s">So people can trust them and they're genuine conversations. They're not designed to craft the message or anything like that</a>
00:05:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h05m24s">They're not manipulative and and that's a big deal</a>
00:05:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h05m28s">YouTube YouTube</a>
00:05:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h05m29s">Particularly doesn't respond well to manipulation as far as I can tell. Well, I enjoyed that conversation enormously. I've been stunned by the response</a>
00:05:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h05m38s">It's gone very very widely as you know</a>
00:05:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h05m41s">Both on your site and on mine</a>
00:05:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h05m44s">But to come back to that day</a>
00:05:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h05m46s">later that day you gave one of the talks of the set one of the seven that you gave in Australia Chatswood and</a>
00:05:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h05m52s">I was very kindly</a>
00:05:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h05m55s">allowed to compare it for you and</a>
00:05:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h05m58s">One thing that 19 years in public life taught me is to have a bit of a look at your audience and summarize them</a>
00:05:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h06m02s">It was a pretty amazing experience. The first thing that happened was that you walked on before you said a word</a>
00:06:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h06m07s">You've got a standing ovation though that that's something unheard of in this country, but they did</a>
00:06:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h06m13s">90 minutes talk they gave you another standing ovation</a>
00:06:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h06m16s">you left came for a few minutes came back on took 30 minutes of questions and</a>
00:06:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h06m22s">Again, they responded in the same way. Let me just say a couple of things about that audience. I was</a>
00:06:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h06m28s">firstly I've got to say pretty heavily impacted as I looked out there and</a>
00:06:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h06m32s">Recognized that there was an enormous hunger to hear what you had to say</a>
00:06:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h06m37s">Even though your message was perhaps best described as tough. Love you weren't</a>
00:06:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h06m42s">Ginger in them up with a soft story. You were really pushing you were really challenging them</a>
00:06:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h06m47s">The second thing that struck me is that I've said many times since I reckon</a>
00:06:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h06m52s">50% of the people in that room that night were young Australian men under the age of probably 35</a>
00:06:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h06m59s">The third thing that struck me was that that was a was a cross section</a>
00:06:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h07m03s">I would say many of them were University students, but all university graduates</a>
00:07:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h07m08s">But many many were not and the fourth thing that just goes back to something. You said a moment ago</a>
00:07:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lWMEZC_Uw#t=00h07m14s">They knew what you were saying and you're a clinical psychologist and a highly educated</a>
