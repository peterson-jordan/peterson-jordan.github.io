00:01:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h01m07s">Well, why don't you start by telling people what you did</a>
00:01:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h01m11s">say over the last twenty years.</a>
00:01:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h01m13s">I know this is a very comprehensive question. I wanted to talk to you because I am</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h01m19s">a few years ago he read a lot of your books and I was interested in their economic analysis</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h01m24s">as a way of determining which</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h01m29s">say crises, or which potential crises are real and also how they can be handled as intelligently as possible.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h01m36s">Thank you so much Jordan,</a>
00:01:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h01m38s">so basically what I'm trying to do is say ... And this is really very, very obvious</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h01m43s">We only have a limited amount of resources</a>
00:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h01m45s">so we should make sure that we direct these funds to the places where we can help the most.</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h01m51s">Where we can do the most good. Remember what we focus on most in the world?</a>
00:01:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h01m55s">These are mostly things that get on the headlines, things that people talk about, and very often things are things in the finals,</a>
00:01:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h02m02s">who have the cutest animals or the most crying children or groups with the best PR</a>
00:02:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h02m08s">and this is certainly not the right way to prioritize. The right way should be: when I spend a dollar or a peso or</a>
00:02:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h02m15s">rupee here</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h02m17s">would I do more good than spend the same dollar, rupee or peso here?</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h02m21s">So basically finding across all possible areas where resources can be spent,</a>
00:02:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h02m26s">where I can help the most. Of course, it's huge</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h02m30s">The conversation itself, because it's not easy to just determine it, but the basic idea is to say it</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h02m35s">Let's focus on the places where you can do the most good,</a>
00:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h02m39s">rather than to the places where we will feel the best. That's basically what I was trying to do</a>
00:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h02m46s">in the last twenty years.</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h02m49s">Of course, prioritizing the world and trying to say 'Where you should spend your money' makes projects</a>
00:02:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h02m55s">about which we say 'These are very, very great hits!'</a>
00:02:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h02m57s">They all love us and consider us the best since the invention of sliced ​​bread,</a>
00:02:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h03m00s">but of course policy projects that are not so effective think we are terrible, so it creates a lot of hostility</a>
00:03:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h03m08s">and a lot of people are upset and biased, but I think it's important to ask these questions.</a>
00:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h03m13s">Well, one question would be 'What is the alternative?'</a>
00:03:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h03m16s">For example, when I looked at the UN Sustainable Development Goals, if I remember correctly,</a>
00:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h03m21s">there were about 200 of them, and that was a few years ago</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h03m25s">I worked in a UN panel and I thought 'The problem with 200 targets is that you can't have 200'</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h03m31s">These are not goals if you have 200, because you definitely need to set priorities if you want to move forward, given some resource constraints.</a>
00:03:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h03m38s">Which is exactly what you just described, in which case the question would be</a>
00:03:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h03m45s">'How do you calculate the benefit?' And this is a very complex problem,</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h03m48s">which is, in my opinion, the reason why it was not solved by a mish-mash of 200 goals.</a>
00:03:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h03m53s">In addition to offending people by prioritizing them.</a>
00:03:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h03m57s">You could tell people a little bit about the methods you used, because I think they are definitely interesting.</a>
00:03:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h04m03s">You are absolutely right. Sustainable development goals.</a>
00:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h04m06s">In fact, we worked with the UN when they created it in 2015.</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h04m13s">It was around 60 to 90 (it was very unclear) UN ambassadors.</a>
00:04:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h04m16s">In fact, I met a quarter of them</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h04m18s">in New York and I talked to each of them and said, 'We shouldn't try to focus</a>
00:04:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h04m22s">to the goals that will do the most good? ' Of course, each of them, as an individual, said yes,</a>
00:04:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h04m28s">but the combined efforts of all UN ambassadors were not, of course, to achieve the best goals,</a>
00:04:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h04m35s">It was to get there the goals of each.</a>
00:04:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h04m37s">So, the Norwegians had three ideas, the Brazilians four and everyone else</a>
00:04:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h04m42s">they had three or four that they wanted to get there, That's why we had 169 goals in the end,</a>
00:04:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h04m47s">which, of course, simply means that everything has been promised everywhere, and that means a lot of people will be very disappointed</a>
00:04:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h04m55s">when the year 2030 comes and we haven't really dealt with everything we promised.</a>
00:04:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h04m59s">So it's happening that</a>
00:04:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h05m02s">the people who create it, including everyone on the list,</a>
00:05:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h05m07s">they maximize the short-term emotional well-being of the people who consult, at the cost of medium or long-term development.</a>
00:05:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h05m15s">On the other hand, in 2030, they will probably no longer be around to bear the consequences.</a>
00:05:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h05m20s">Or at least, yes,</a>
00:05:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h05m21s">at least no one will see that we didn't do as much as we could,</a>
00:05:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h05m26s">because we helped a little everywhere. But helping everywhere a bit</a>
00:05:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h05m31s">it's not nearly as good as an incredible amount of benefit in places where you can help the most with the extra resources.</a>
00:05:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h05m38s">Remember, we estimate</a>
00:05:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h05m39s">the total cost of the Sustainable Development Goals is somewhere around $ 2.5 trillion</a>
00:05:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h05m46s">and the amount actually available is about $ 140 billion.</a>
00:05:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h05m51s">So we have literally 5% of what we promise.</a>
00:05:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h05m54s">We promise mountains, mines and then we say:</a>
00:05:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h05m56s">'Hey, there's some money here, let's break it up and everyone would get a piece'</a>
00:05:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h06m02s">Good,</a>
00:06:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h06m03s">so that's partly from where you derive your assumption that we have a limited amount of resources, that you're really using a real number a</a>
00:06:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h06m10s">The number you use is what is really available and when you wrote 'How to Spend $ 75 Billion'</a>
00:06:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h06m15s">so you actually took half of what was available.</a>
00:06:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h06m18s">Yes, it was much earlier. And it's a fun idea to say:</a>
00:06:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h06m24s">'How would you spend a certain amount?' And yes, it was half.</a>
00:06:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h06m27s">So we didn't say we should spend everything exactly as we said.</a>
00:06:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h06m32s">Okay, so let me agree with you</a>
00:06:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h06m34s">To agree, people have to admit that</a>

00:09:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h09m57s">if I were to think of criticism, say from the point of view of the social sciences or</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h10m02s">political perspectives. The first thing I would object to is</a>
00:10:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h10m06s">Well, as you know, your price and benefit calculations are</a>
00:10:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h10m13s">accurate and as you know they are</a>
00:10:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h10m18s">basically as free as possible from any political bias</a>
00:10:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h10m22s">Because your critics will no doubt protest, as if they were likely to be there</a>
00:10:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h10m29s">Let's call them implicit prejudices, even though I'm not a fan of this idea, in a sense</a>
00:10:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h10m35s">There will be basic assumptions that will consider the way in which economic calculations are performed</a>
00:10:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h10m40s">and then, of course, you have to believe the idea that a cost-benefit analysis approach is actually valid.</a>
00:10:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h10m45s">So, could you tell me what you did to delay or take this criticism into account?</a>
00:10:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h10m51s">Sure. So, first of all, we don't just ask one team of economists</a>
00:10:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h10m56s">we also have other teams</a>
00:10:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h10m58s">which evaluate these</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h10m59s">economists and we are just trying to make sure that there is some criticism, say from both sides, so let us know that it is not</a>
00:10:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h11m05s">just an ideology-driven number, but it's a very empirically quite clear number that says, for example, that if you focus on</a>

00:11:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h11m21s">You might object, 'Well, you could do it somehow</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h11m26s">ideologically viewed? ' One thing is to say, 'Have you evaluated all people as equal?'</a>
00:11:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h11m32s">Yes, we did. And of course, from an economic point of view, you might argue that they are not.</a>
00:11:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h11m38s">I think very few people would like to do that,</a>
00:11:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h11m40s">but what we do is that across all these areas, we value all people</a>
00:11:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h11m45s">as equally important. That is: just as valuable, and that is, of course, a political appreciation.</a>
00:11:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h11m51s">But I think if we look around the world, that's right.</a>
00:11:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h11m55s">On the contrary, it may mean that people from the richest countries are valued too little compared to what they are willing to do on their own.</a>
00:11:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h12m03s">But this means we have the measurement right in the sense: 'Where do you spend the extra money if it's your goal</a>
00:12:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h12m10s">help the world as much as possible? '</a>
00:12:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h12m13s">Good. So you used the approach</a>
00:12:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h12m14s">which was simply, I would say, a reliable measurement approach</a>
00:12:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h12m19s">from a theoretical point of view because the idea would have</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h12m23s">multiple measurements of the same phenomenon or set of phenomena and observe where</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h12m31s">And that would be a problem of reliability</a>
00:12:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h12m33s">so if you have multiple teams of economists and</a>
00:12:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h12m36s">you will all come across something close to approval and look at a diverse range of opinions</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h12m42s">then you can be quite sure that you have met something that is real. And that also includes the element of mutual evaluation.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h13m03s">But the main point is, of course, in a way, if we take a step back</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h13m06s">This is not a question of getting absolute numbers perfectly correct. I mean, it would be great if we could do it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h13m14s">Vaccination - For every dollar you spend, you get back $ 60 in value</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h13m18s">It would be very, very unlikely that this is the right number, but there is much much more to getting the right order.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h13m32s">Compare across all the other things where you can also spend money and there we have a lot bigger</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h14m08s">so as long as your method</a>

00:14:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h14m23s">interventions that far exceed all others in terms of creating a positive economic result?</a>
00:14:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h14m30s">And what proportion of the total, say 170 goals, if you met 10 percent of those</a>
00:14:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h14m39s">170 goals, what would be the economic growth?</a>
00:14:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h14m44s">I should say that I did not put this question. That's wonderful, because that's exactly what we were trying to do.</a>
00:14:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h14m49s">so if you take it from all these areas, every dollar spent will do around</a>
00:14:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h14m54s">seven dollars good if you did it evenly across all</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h14m57s">which is probably pointless to assume, but it is not unreasonable and it is a certain proverbial estimate</a>

00:15:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h15m12s">so you can simply spend the same amount and benefit four times more than if you did</a>
00:15:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h15m19s">it scattered to all areas</a>
00:15:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h15m20s">and again</a>
00:15:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h15m22s">What you also need to remember is that many of the things we look at are very very</a>
00:15:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h15m26s">Effective are also much more feasible, so two of the best things we highlight are</a>
00:15:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h15m34s">contraception, hence family planning for women</a>
00:15:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h15m36s">Why? Because if you do ... there are 13% of women who still don't have access to contraception</a>
00:15:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h15m44s">and if they gained that access,</a>
00:15:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h15m46s">So you would be able to better plan your children and know that this means you can have your children when you are</a>
00:15:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h15m52s">Ready for them, which means you put more effort and investment into your children. So they will grow better. They will be better fed.</a>
00:15:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h15m59s">They will have a better chance of survival, but they will also be more productive in the future.</a>
00:15:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h16m04s">It also means that fewer of these children will die. Fewer mothers will die</a>
00:16:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h16m08s">so we actually estimate that roughly</a>
00:16:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h16m11s">600,000 fewer children will die.</a>
00:16:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h16m13s">You get a demographic redistribution. Basically, because you have slightly fewer children, you can invest more in them</a>
00:16:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h16m20s">you get more return from each child, you have a slightly higher growth rate.</a>
00:16:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h16m24s">And so we estimate that for every dollar spent on family planning</a>
00:16:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h16m28s">You get $ 140 for social good. Another great thing is</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h16m39s">In fact, we had the last big discussion on free trade since DOHA in 1999</a>

00:16:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h16m49s">but also with many other people who somehow gave up free trade, but</a>
00:16:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h16m53s">we must remember that one of the basic things that made us rich</a>
00:16:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h16m57s">is the fact that we trade with each other. You do what you're good at and I do what I excel at, and that means</a>
00:16:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h17m03s">that if we exchange, we all make money on it. There are some problems ...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h17m07s">Maybe you could tell people in more detail what that would mean in practice. What kinds of obstacles</a>
00:17:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h17m15s">you have specified</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h17m16s">they are particularly problematic and need to be addressed.</a>
00:17:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h17m20s">So we actually estimated what would be needed to get a fairly successful Qatar Round, which would not be free trade,</a>
00:17:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h17m27s">but it would be a freer trade.</a>
00:17:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h17m29s">It would simply be reduced tariffs, making it easier for everyone to trade around the world,</a>

00:17:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h17m48s">So at the end of these Sustainable Development Goals, we would lift 145 million people out of poverty.</a>
00:17:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h17m55s">But basically we would benefit everyone because if</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h17m59s">you are in a poor country, you would be able to sell the things you do best a little easier and a little cheaper</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h18m12s">benefited everyone. Again, it's not a science. I mean, if you look at China, for example</a>
00:18:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h18m18s">During the last thirty years, China has lifted many ... 680 million people out of poverty.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h22m03s">We talked about expanding vaccination, that's an incredibly good way. We know that we have currently reduced child mortality,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h22m12s">I am referring to undefined mortality, from 12 million children dying each year in 1990 to about 6 million.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h22m19s">This is a fantastic achievement. Of course, 6 million is still a striking number,</a>

00:22:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h22m28s">we could save a million children every year. You almost have to say it again. For a billion dollars</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h22m59s">is because they don't have enough money. It is not that we are not able to produce it.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h23m02s">so it's because they are poor and can't meet demand. But the real tragedy</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h23m34s">But scientists and some of the researchers we work with have now proved it. Because they went back to the old study</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h23m52s">And then they visited two other villages in the countryside and gave the children basically sugar water.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h24m05s">you could see what had happened, and it was exactly as the theory predicted. If you got good food,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h24m58s">And the important part is that for other people as well. If you are good, you are likely to help others.</a>
00:24:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h25m05s">That's right, oh yes. This is absolutely important. So, yes, so it's quite surprising ...</a>
00:25:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h25m11s">It was quite surprising to me when I came across your work to what extent it was focused on</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h25m17s">children's health, in a basic sense, in developing countries. It looks like, I mean, if you should sum it up,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h25m24s">correct me if I'm wrong, it seemed like what you were focusing on or where your efforts took you.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h25m32s">Can I just say? There are other relatively easy targets. For example, what you see more and more in the world is,</a>
00:25:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h25m39s">That more and more people are dying not because of a contagious disease because we are, in fact</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h25m52s">It turns out to be quite expensive to deal with cancer, but we know</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h26m01s">but to allow people to live longer, basically by making them very cheap</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h26m30s">We also emphasize, and this is again one of the daunting things we should focus on much more,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h29m33s">Because I'm very interested, because I don't see any problems with your method in advance.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h29m40s">It seems to me to make a lot of sense.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h29m49s">which seems like a damn good goal,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h30m07s">So I tried to think about why.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h30m13s">As I went through the climate literature, which was a few years ago, I was seriously concerned about the accuracy of the measurements.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h30m20s">and so on, because it's a very complicated problem and it's not ...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h31m30s">It is al difficult for me to believe in climatology and the rean for that is that I find it motivated</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h32m34s">I'll try to answer some of it.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h32m38s">I think when you look, yes, there is a lot of uncertainty when looking to the future.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h32m43s">Some of this is interrupted when you say that we are not sure how much the temperature will rise.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h32m49s">But we know that if the cause is CO2</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h33m16s">Another thing, I have no doubt, there are many other reasons why people cling to the social</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h33m31s">There are many other people who notice: 'Ah, it actually fits into my ideological</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h34m09s">But again, I met many of these climatologists.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h34m19s">So we just take our starting point with you and the climate panel</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h34m22s">We do that by asking</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h36m51s">So basically spending one to two percent of GDP now and</a>
00:36:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h36m55s">every year, for the rest of the century, with the advent of 2100, we would solve almost nothing.</a>
00:36:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h37m01s">So you still have to pay for the same problems of global warming</a>
00:37:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h37m06s">as now</a>
00:37:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h37m08s">minus a small amount. And you paid one to two percent each year.</a>
00:37:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h37m12s">This is the main reason why most price-benefit analyzes show</a>
00:37:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h37m16s">that if you don't do it very carefully and</a>
00:37:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h37m19s">you only do small procedures and you do them very cleverly, you actually create higher costs than the problem itself,</a>
00:37:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h37m26s">which you are trying to solve.</a>
00:37:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h37m27s">We can find a middle ground and do it very carefully, but it requires a lot of cleverness from a large number of politicians.</a>
00:37:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h37m34s">But if we do it very roughly, we will only incur great costs and in fact get very little.</a>
00:37:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h37m39s">Okay, so when people who aren't happy with you because you don't prioritize climate change the way it deserves, hypothetically ...</a>
00:37:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h37m48s">How do they criticize your statements, on what basis do they decide that your conclusions are inappropriate?</a>
00:37:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h37m55s">I think if you read most things on the internet, there are a lot of opinions that say:</a>
00:37:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h38m01s">'You deny it, you can't say ... We're excommunicating you, we don't want to talk to you. That's not right.'</a>
00:38:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h38m07s">I will not talk about these people because they are, more than anything, political attitudes.</a>
00:38:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h38m13s">I think one can come up with a reasonable argument and say that this is not the only way to approach it.</a>
00:38:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h38m19s">So there are two ways to think about it</a>
00:38:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h38m21s">cost-benefit analysis, which in fact shows that climate action is worth doing. One is the statement:</a>
00:38:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h38m29s">I see! But there may be very little risk</a>
00:38:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h38m31s">even if there is little risk that the whole world will spiral out of control and we will all die.</a>
00:38:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h38m36s">And you know, it's not unlikely.</a>
00:38:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h38m38s">Especially when you say something like ... It doesn't say a percentage, but it's not ... It's more than zero.</a>
00:38:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h38m45s">So there is a greater than zero chance that global warming will spiral out of control and essentially stay</a>
00:38:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h38m51s">only a few hundred people living in Antarctica without glaciers.</a>
00:38:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h38m57s">So it's a positive loop argument. That we could trigger mechanisms such as the melting of the Greenland Glacier.</a>
00:38:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h39m03s">That would flood the world or cause it</a>
00:39:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h39m06s">irreparable catastrophes of unprecedented proportions. Okay, so I have a question for that.</a>
00:39:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h39m11s">Because it's not easy to say it. It is basically an apocalyptic argument.</a>
00:39:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h39m15s">And then the argument would be: If there is a one percent chance of an infinite apocalypse,</a>
00:39:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h39m20s">it is worth using any means to avert it. So...</a>
00:39:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h39m25s">One way to think about it is to multiply disasters.</a>
00:39:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h39m30s">Because I suspect that the same argument could be used in</a>
00:39:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h39m35s">connection with many of the other problems you are trying to deal with, such as ...</a>
00:39:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h39m40s">I do not know what the probability is if we leave a substantial number of people in extreme poverty for, say, another twenty years,</a>
00:39:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h39m47s">more than we have to, we would increase the likelihood of creation</a>
00:39:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h39m54s">epidemic and infectious diseases.</a>
00:39:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h39m57s">Because of poverty.</a>
00:39:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h39m58s">Poor people are at risk for everyone ... this is a terrible way to think about it, though</a>
00:39:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h40m04s">Poverty is a risk for all. That's a better way to think about it, because</a>
00:40:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h40m08s">Decreased global human health is also fertile ground for all sorts of disasters that can occur. And then there is the political possibility</a>
00:40:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h40m15s">instability and nuclear war and all these things that are equally apocalyptic.</a>
00:40:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h40m21s">So it seems somewhat reasonable to me to say: Look,</a>
00:40:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h40m25s">there is a possibility across a wide range of potential crises</a>
00:40:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h40m29s">unforeseen loops of positive out-of-control feedback. But we can't involve them in the debate until</a>
00:40:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h40m35s">we are not able to parameterize them because it is in a way an unfair move that you cannot be wrong about.</a>
00:40:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h40m44s">Exactly and you basically say that if you allow it in this area, purely because you like the specific</a>
00:40:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h40m51s">area and you say: I want you to spend more money on my cause, which is climate change,</a>
00:40:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h40m55s">you could do the same in a lot of other areas. And I actually think you can strengthen your argument.</a>
00:40:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h41m00s">It's not just poverty that creates a lot of risk,</a>
00:41:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h41m04s">but it also breeds terrorism and a willingness to do a lot of bad things</a>
00:41:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h41m10s">focused, so it's not just something that normally happens.</a>
00:41:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h41m13s">throw in the shopping terrorists and ours</a>
00:41:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h41m16s">The ability to keep all the world's plutonium under lock and key and get disaster from everything.</a>
00:41:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h41m24s">So, for example, extreme poverty. You can imagine that two socio-economic causes can contribute to this.</a>
00:41:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h41m29s">Firstly, it would be the total number of people in extreme poverty who are therefore</a>
00:41:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h41m33s">desperate and then it could be too much</a>
00:41:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h41m38s">inequality and the feeling that the world is not distributed fairly, which would justify it</a>
00:41:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h41m44s">political and revolutionary instability and then ...</a>
00:41:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h41m46s">and also</a>
00:41:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h41m48s">the failure of the state and many other things that we know make it easier for everyone to commit very bad deeds, as we have seen</a>
00:41:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h41m55s">from Afghanistan</a>
00:41:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h41m57s">with September 11. Many other things, once a state fails, a lot of bad things happen.</a>
00:41:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h42m03s">Correctly. Okay, so we're trying to improve the situation of people in the world to reduce the likelihood</a>
00:42:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h42m10s">widespread political and economic instability and this is another way of averting the apocalypse. Bjorn: Yes.</a>
00:42:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h42m18s">I can only ... So Nordhaus was actually dealing with this, the Nobel Prize winner, because some people came up with exactly what you just said.</a>
00:42:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h42m24s">There is a slight risk that things will go very wrong,</a>
00:42:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h42m27s">so we should spend all our money on this problem.</a>
00:42:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h42m30s">But of course this is a bad argument, because there are many small risks everywhere else.</a>
00:42:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h42m36s">We know of one risk</a>
00:42:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h42m37s">and that we will be hit by an asteroid. That could wipe it out</a>
00:42:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h42m42s">Earth. Even so, and I think Nordhaus did it very elegantly.</a>
00:42:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h42m47s">We know we can track all asteroids</a>
00:42:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h42m51s">99.99%</a>
00:42:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h42m53s">but we decided to track only 90% because tracking the rest was very expensive.</a>
00:42:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h42m59s">So you can actually see that we have determined the amount we are willing to do it for.</a>
00:42:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h43m04s">And of course it's just one place where we have a very clear example where we say: We care a little about the future,</a>
00:43:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h43m10s">but we don't care about it completely. We have a lot of other issues that we want to focus on right now.</a>
00:43:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h43m16s">So it's like any other area. You have to ask</a>
00:43:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h43m20s">what are the risks and what are the options to do so and</a>
00:43:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h43m24s">resolutely, given that there are certain risks and the risk of loss is likely to outweigh the potential for a potential benefit in global warming,</a>
00:43:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h43m30s">we should probably do a little more than we normally would. And that's exactly what the models show us, and that's the models</a>
00:43:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h43m36s">which we use to make an estimate of how much we should pay for global warming.</a>
00:43:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h43m40s">So yes, we should take that into account, but it's not a good argument. That was one argument. I am sorry</a>
00:43:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h43m46s">I'll try to be a little faster with that next argument.</a>
00:43:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h43m48s">Another argument is that people will say:</a>
00:43:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h43m51s">One of the reasons it doesn't pay to invest in global warming is because you have to pay now,</a>
00:43:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h43m56s">but the benefits will come far in the future.</a>
00:43:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h43m58s">In short, you will do something that is expensive and you will get a small benefit in a hundred years.</a>
00:43:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h44m04s">So you really have to say that the future is incredibly important. In economic terms - the discount rate is very low</a>
00:44:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h44m12s">That you really care about the future. Many people would argue:</a>
00:44:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h44m16s">We should...</a>
00:44:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h44m17s">We are rich, we should be able to be overwhelming</a>
00:44:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h44m20s">care about the future. And if you change that parameter enough and say, 'We care immensely about future generations'</a>
00:44:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h44m27s">It actually turns out that global warming is a good business. Doing something about global warming will change from</a>
00:44:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h44m33s">the claim that for every dollar spent, you can prevent climate damage of a few cents,</a>
00:44:33</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h45m25s">So you've got it to basically turn everything into a great idea.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h45m29s">and this is also, intellectually, the reason why the discount rate is very very low. It means that you would basically</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h45m44s">If you do, I applaud your certain ... your consistency,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h45m49s">but most people just don't do this and we definitely don't do it that way ...</a>

00:45:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h46m05s">As far as the climate is concerned, we want to look to the future very much, but we do not want to do it in other areas.</a>
00:46:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h46m10s">Okay, so you have to be consistent. You have to do it in all areas and then you need to be very hungry and eat only oatmeal.</a>
00:46:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h46m15s">So your statement is basically, from a methodological point of view, that your order remains the same at different discount rates.</a>
00:46:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h46m22s">Yes.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h46m24s">Importantly, this is a really fundamentally important point</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h46m31s">Of course, for example, education is one where you pay now and you get benefits in 10 to 50 years, when you</a>

00:46:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h46m40s">So there is a change, but for the most part the order remains the same and I only</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h46m53s">It is important in all areas and then you really have to do everything and give up your good life yourself.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h47m00s">Well, another thing worth mentioning about the discount rate is</a>
00:47:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h47m04s">that you can argue that the future is more important than the present,</a>
00:47:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h47m08s">especially since it goes so far,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h47m10s">But another reason why people underestimate the future is because you can't prove you're capable</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h47m42s">underestimating the future the right approach, because you are able to predict what will happen if you intervene now,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h47m47s">now and maybe tomorrow, but you are much less accurate as you move on in time.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h47m52s">So even in the best case where we wanted the best for the future, that doesn't mean we can justify an incredibly radical</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h48m07s">If you look at what previous generations have done for us,</a>
00:48:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=00h48m10s">the only thing they really managed to pass on to us is much more knowledge.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h00m15s">no method does everything. So we have two very obvious problems. One is - Not all problems are about money.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h01m09s">So in a sense, we tell you where you can spend money, but we're not talking about things that don't require money.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h02m40s">The main thing is that there are still a considerable number of problems where we need to look at the redistribution of resources, and there we have a strong argument.</a>
01:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h02m48s">The second part, the second kind of criticism, which is very fair criticism, is that we do not look at inequality.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h02m55s">Economists are very, very poor at dealing with inequality, because that is basically a political problem.</a>
01:02:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h03m02s">So when we look at, 'You'll spend a dollar and do good for $ 60,' we're not looking at who gets that $ 60.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h03m26s">so, in fact, it mostly also helped with inequality.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h07m21s">Because one of the things that people promote</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h07m25s">radical interventions at present with regard to long-term climate change have not been taken into account is the opposite</a>

01:07:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h07m44s">So the first question was:</a>
01:07:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h07m47s">'How do you feel about your influence?' And the second: 'What can you say about what is happening in France?'</a>
01:07:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h07m52s">Yes I can..? I will answer in the reverse order, because I think the case of France is very good ...</a>
01:07:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h08m00s">good argument. If you ask people around the world, 'Do you care about global warming?' Almost</a>
01:08:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h08m04s">everyone says 'Yes' ... 'Do you want to do something about it?'</a>
01:08:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h08m08s">They say 'Yes'. If you ask them, 'How much are you willing to pay?' common answer</a>
01:08:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h08m13s">in both rich and poor countries, it costs a few hundred dollars a year</a>
01:08:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h08m17s">So it ranges from a hundred to two hundred dollars. So basically people say, 'Yes, I care</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h08m24s">I'm willing to spend some money, but not much. '</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h10m55s">In the 1860s, we hunted whales to extinction because whales have an excellent oil that burns much cleaner and much brighter.</a>
01:10:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h11m04s">So it was amazing for households in North America and Europe</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h11m19s">in the style of global warming to this problem would be to say, 'Could you dim the light a little?'</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h11m27s">And of course you would completely fail. What really saved the whales was the discovery of oil.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h11m39s">So it happened that in about ten years, the whales stopped being killed because there was a better one</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h12m09s">Well, let's just say this in a cliché style is to come up with a better solution,</a>
01:12:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h12m14s">which is cheaper energy that has all the advantages and fewer disadvantages. And so the problem really is solved.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h12m39s">but it is the only possible long-term solution. It's much cheaper and much more efficient.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h15m24s">the ads were very professionally executed and created, so ...</a>
01:15:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h15m29s">Well, I don't know what you think about it, but I mean ...</a>
01:15:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h15m34s">One of the reasons I'm talking to you today is because I want to put it on YouTube and post it</a>
01:15:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h15m38s">in the podcast, so that more people find out about it and so ...</a>
01:15:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h15m43s">Yes, so of course the short answer is. We tried it because we are economists and we think, 'Sure,</a>
01:15:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h15m50s">that would be a good idea. ' Let me tell you about something else we did.</a>
01:15:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h15m53s">We worked a lot and just talked about the planet.</a>
01:15:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h15m57s">So when setting priorities on a global scale, it's very interesting academically,</a>
01:15:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h16m03s">but unfortunately it mostly has such an impact that people say, 'Yes, that's probably true somewhere else.'</a>
01:16:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h16m09s">So when we tell the audience, they say, 'Yeah,</a>
01:16:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h16m11s">this probably applies to Mexico. ' And Mexico will say, 'That's probably true of Argentina.' And so everyone just pushes it to someone else.</a>
01:16:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h16m18s">The planet is never someone's problem. Sure, someone else has to fix it. So we started doing more within the states.</a>
01:16:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h16m27s">So we did it a few years ago in Bangladesh.</a>
01:16:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h16m30s">And within the nation, of course, there is an overlap between those who decide where to spend money and the problems we analyze.</a>
01:16:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h16m38s">So we did the exact same thing only for Bangladesh.</a>
01:16:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h16m41s">So we made a list of priorities from all things ... We had fun with everyone in Bangladesh,</a>
01:16:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h16m46s">we asked them to tell us which are the best things they want to focus on,</a>
01:16:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h16m49s">what are the smartest new solutions. We worked with the prime minister's research and analysis team,</a>
01:16:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h16m53s">Minister of Finance and everyone else, and we talked about where money can actually be spent properly. And again, this is the menu,</a>
01:16:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h16m59s">which is not entirely politically correct. Politicians definitely don't like all this. But the finance minister would say:</a>
01:16:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h17m06s">'Um no, no ... yes, I like this,</a>
01:17:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h17m08s">And so they did some of the things I say.</a>
01:17:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h17m10s">So that solves the Tower of Babel problem</a>
01:17:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h17m13s">to some extent. There is too much distance ...</a>
01:17:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h17m15s">There is too much distance between the local and the global and therefore ... You are using the nation state as a psychological mediator.</a>
01:17:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h17m24s">So there, we actually estimated, that every dollar spent on what we did did the least</a>
01:17:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h17m30s">$ 10,000 good, purely because we helped change spending money in</a>

01:17:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h17m40s">And again, we didn't change Bangladesh to suddenly become super rational.</a>
01:17:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h17m46s">We changed them a bit. We opposed weak ideas and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h17m51s">wind in the back for the good. So we did it in Haiti. We are doing it now in India together with the Tata Foundation. We just got back,</a>
01:17:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h17m58s">that's why we're a little tired or have sleepy eyes.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h18m06s">Great, so you can do it globally</a>

01:18:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h18m10s">And I think we'll have a lot bigger</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h18m20s">But of course, if that's true in Ghana,</a>
01:18:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h18m22s">this is probably also true in a neighboring state. Jordan: So you get the overlap. Bjorn: Exactly.</a>
01:18:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h18m26s">So I think ... It would be great to have</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h18m37s">Just come up with all these great ideas and I think we are reasonably successful.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h18m53s">This is not really the case. What you do is not boring. It's completely exciting to the point.</a>
01:18:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h18m58s">I mean, I don't think it's boring, and I also don't believe it contains a strong narrative message.</a>
01:18:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h19m04s">The point is, they exist</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h19m50s">we would like to do it intelligently and carefully and</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h22m28s">a form of useless modesty.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h22m59s">It would not have a negative effect on anyone, it would be purely benefits. Even in case of an error. And an error occurs.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h23m40s">I think people can stand up for it without any real cynicism. They can say, 'Look,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h23m57s">Amazing.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h23m58s">I just want to say. Again, we said several times that something I did ... I have to say, understand,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h24m18s">However, you know, they give weight to all this research. And that is why we can say with certainty:</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h24m24s">'This is not just a whim, but it's probably the best we know now.'</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h24m29s">Probably, as you pointed out, that's not entirely true, but it's definitely better than anything else we have now.</a>
01:24:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h24m35s">Okay, that's it. So, that's actually the right comparison. This is not the absolute truth. Yes. But no one has a better idea.</a>
01:24:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h24m44s">Okay, so we stick to the best idea we have.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h25m12s">We should do it regularly.</a>
01:25:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h25m14s">Yes, we definitely should. When you started creating more National Indices.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h25m24s">We haven't done it in the United States, purely because it's dysfunctional in many ways.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h25m28s">We saw several other people trying to do it without our involvement and ...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h25m35s">You have all these economists working on it. And the first draft of the study they come up with is: 'It's very difficult,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h25m40s">we need 10 years and a lot of money for research, and then we'll probably give you something. '</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h26m01s">in fact it could be Canada, but that was about ten years ago. It ended up as a very interesting anthology</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h26m12s">without any consistency we are trying to achieve.</a>
01:26:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h26m16s">What would it cost to do something like this for Canada?</a>
01:26:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h26m21s">In a nutshell. It costs about two and a half million dollars. It is simply not entirely proportional.</a>
01:26:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h26m29s">Doing it for Ghana is the same as doing it for Canada.</a>
01:26:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h26m32s">How long would it take?</a>
01:26:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h26m35s">18 months.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h26m36s">God! That's such a great idea. So $ 2.5 million and </a>
01:26:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h26m42s">Okay, I'll end this.</a>
01:26:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h26m43s">Maybe we can figure out how to get that money.</a>
01:26:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h26m46s">We should try. It would be good.</a>
01:26:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h26m49s">I think there would be a lot of interest in it in Canada.</a>
01:26:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h26m51s">And Canada would be a great way to apply it to the United States without doing it in the United States.</a>
01:26:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h26m57s">Well, that would be good, because we throw ourselves politically and it would be nice ...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h27m02s">Ok, so this is material for another interview.</a>
01:27:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h27m07s">I have several other interviews that I would like to have with you about policy development and also about marketing,</a>
01:27:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h27m12s">but we'll keep them for another time.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h27m22s">Ok, awesome, awesome. So I'll post it as soon as I can.</a>
01:27:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrbooi9PNw#t=01h27m25s">Amazing. Good. To hearing.</a>
