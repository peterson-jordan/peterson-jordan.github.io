<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVtj-lQsxV0#t=00h00m37s">And I was wondering what you what your thoughts are on ADHD itself</a>
00:00:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVtj-lQsxV0#t=00h00m43s">and on</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVtj-lQsxV0#t=00h01m00s">Okay, so first of all it's definitely over diagnosed</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVtj-lQsxV0#t=00h01m19s">Scientific categories, they're weird hybrids right first of all psychiatrists aren't scientists. They're engineers</a>
00:01:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVtj-lQsxV0#t=00h01m24s">Engineers are trying to do something rather than to describe the objective world and psychiatrists are trying to make people healthy whatever that means</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVtj-lQsxV0#t=00h01m39s">We don't know how to distinguish it from temperamental variation so for example if you're high in openness and high in extraversion and low in</a>
00:01:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVtj-lQsxV0#t=00h01m47s">conscientiousness</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVtj-lQsxV0#t=00h01m50s">Low in agreeableness  and and high in neuroticism you're likely to manifest symptoms of ADHD</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVtj-lQsxV0#t=00h01m58s">It's because you're exploratory you don't like to sit down</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVtj-lQsxV0#t=00h02m01s">You're full of ideas your attention scatters across a wide variety of topics and you very stable</a>
00:02:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVtj-lQsxV0#t=00h02m07s">temperamental variation it's also much more common among boys</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVtj-lQsxV0#t=00h02m13s">Panksepp showed same guy with rats that if you deprive young routes of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVtj-lQsxV0#t=00h02m29s">Then their prefrontal cortexes</a>
00:02:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVtj-lQsxV0#t=00h02m31s">Don't develop very well because they're not having the right kind of experiences and that you can treat that quite effectively with</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVtj-lQsxV0#t=00h02m37s">psychomotor stimulants like ritalin</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVtj-lQsxV0#t=00h02m39s">so that's kind of an interesting bit of scientific information that no one pays any attention to</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVtj-lQsxV0#t=00h02m45s">There is also absolutely no evidence whatsoever that long-term use of psychomotor stimulants produces increases in cognitive</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVtj-lQsxV0#t=00h03m12s">That's a such a rat's nest that I don't want to even discuss it. I mean it it. I'll discuss it for like 15 seconds</a>
00:03:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVtj-lQsxV0#t=00h03m21s">There is a never-ending</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVtj-lQsxV0#t=00h03m34s">I know that I was a problem. I seriously know that I've dealt with extraordinarily damaged people in my life</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVtj-lQsxV0#t=00h03m43s">You're a bloody hard pressed to find someone who doesn't have a serious problem or</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVtj-lQsxV0#t=00h04m14s">the way that you deal with it is you have objective standards you apply them to everyone not because that's</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVtj-lQsxV0#t=00h04m32s">We don't know that yet because we haven't seen the full range of the tyranny of the alternatives manifest itself not in our culture</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVtj-lQsxV0#t=00h04m39s">But it certainly did in other cultures. I think it's a bad idea now I</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVtj-lQsxV0#t=00h04m57s">Would allow you to do the work in the university and in the workplace</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVtj-lQsxV0#t=00h05m06s">But I think that was done a lot better when that was in the hands of the professor's and not in the hands of these</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVtj-lQsxV0#t=00h05m21s">Possibly because they mean they're walking corpses as far as I can tell</a>
