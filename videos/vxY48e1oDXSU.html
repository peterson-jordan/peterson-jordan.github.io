<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h00m03s">Which they themselves know that they must overcome in order to reach their goals</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h00m12s">That is, standing before and facing their problems and fears</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h00m15s">Then they will gain maturity and strength that has no limit when it stops. For example, ask yourself if for ten years</a>
00:00:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h00m19s">You did not ignore the things you were supposed to do according to your life perspective</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h00m24s">And your principles and plans that you have planned for yourself, how will they be then?</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h00m30s">In fact, there are examples of great people who came into this world and gave themselves examples</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h00m35s">Others have followed this path for decades</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h00m39s">That is, for decades, they followed a method they had set for themselves</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h01m11s">But it is a truth that includes good news and a promise because what that means is that there is another view of the world</a>
00:01:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h01m15s">You can acquire it, and there are many ways to influence the world that you can adopt</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h01m20s">And implementing it so that the results that accrue to you from your adoption of this new vision are better than what was previously mentioned</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h01m24s">The other point is to imagine if a number of people took this perspective and followed suit</a>
00:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h01m28s">Because as humans, we have accomplished many great things</a>
00:01:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h01m31s">For example, more than 250,000 people will be uprooted from extreme poverty and about 300,000 people</a>
00:01:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h01m37s">Electricity will be provided to them, and that means saving large groups from extreme poverty</a>
00:01:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h01m43s">At a rate and speed unprecedented in human history at all, these achievements have been achieved</a>
00:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h01m48s">Very quickly, for example, in the year 2000, the United Nations planned</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h01m52s">To reduce poverty between 2000 and 2015, and 2013 goals were achieved</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h01m59s">There is growing disparity in the level of income significantly in many countries</a>
00:01:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h02m03s">And you can hear about this in the heated political debates but generally</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h02m07s">The overall income level is going up and that's really great</a>
00:02:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h02m12s">In fact, we can achieve what we have achieved exponentially, to an unknown extent</a>
00:02:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h02m15s">If nations united and united their efforts to achieve and achieve a specific goal</a>
00:02:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h02m20s">Because, from my experience, we only use about fifty-one percent of our capabilities</a>
00:02:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h02m24s">You can deduce that for yourself. I usually ask university students</a>
00:02:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h02m28s">How many hours of your time are wasted per day, or how many hours per week are you wasting</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h02m32s">The usual answer is about 4 to 6 hours a day</a>
00:02:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h02m36s">And these hours are lost between useless study and watching videos</a>
00:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h02m40s">On Youtube, the most amazing thing is to watch videos not only, not desire</a>
00:02:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h02m43s">For them to watch it, not even care about its content, which after watching it they feel</a>
00:02:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h02m46s">Regret that they saw it and in this story you waste about 4 hours</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h02m50s">In total, about 20 to 25 hours per week</a>
00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h02m52s">That is, about 100 hours per month</a>
00:02:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h02m54s">This equates to two and a half weeks of work, i.e. half a year of work per year</a>
00:02:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h02m57s">If the working hour was estimated at twenty dollars, it is undoubtedly much more than that</a>
00:02:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h03m01s">It is likely to be around $ 50, given the deferred payment of salaries</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h03m05s">If you waste 20 hours a week, you are wasting about 50 thousand dollars annually</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h03m10s">And you're really doing it</a>
00:03:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h03m13s">And because you are at work, you waste fifty thousand dollars a year</a>
00:03:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h03m16s">You are considered a greater calamity than if I did the same as you</a>
00:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h03m19s">Because I will not stay on the ground as long as you will</a>
00:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h03m22s">So if your life is not as good as it could be</a>
00:03:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h03m25s">Then ask yourself what would happen if I stopped wasting my time and opportunities</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h03m29s">Then you will be who knows how effective and accomplished you will be</a>
00:03:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h03m32s">It would probably multiply to ten</a>
00:03:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h03m34s">Times or twenty times more than you are now</a>
00:03:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h03m37s">On the Pareto Principle, people cannot be predicted about the capacity and effectiveness that they will be</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h03m40s">Their capacity and effectiveness will go beyond the limits to be counted</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h03m44s">If we gathered as a nation, united our efforts, and also stopped spoiling things</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h03m48s">Because this is something people go for all the time</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h03m51s">That is, they not only are not doing what needs to be done to improve things, they are</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h03m54s">They intentionally seek to make things worse than they are</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h03m57s">Whether it is because they are spiteful, resentful, arrogant, deceptive, or</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h04m10s">If people really and diligently stop making things worse, then we don't know how much</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h04m14s">The great improvement we will only see once we stop spoiling</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h04m17s">There is this strange correlation and intermingling with our reality</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY48e1oDXSU#t=00h04m21s">Between human weakness and society's imposed judgments, which as a whole are considered a cause</a>
