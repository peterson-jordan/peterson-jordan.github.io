<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=00h04m00s">there are people and perhaps Kuhn would

soon more was more like a I would say</a>
00:04:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=00h04m41s">more like a classic view of science
where so for example when Newton came up</a>
00:04:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=00h04m46s">with Newtonian physics there was a set
of propositions upon which Newtonian</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=00h04m51s">physics was based and then when Einstein
transformed those propositions what</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=00h04m55s">happened was that Newtonian physics
became a subset of Einsteinian physics</a>
00:04:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=00h04m59s">and so the way that Piaget looked at the
development of factual ideas at least in</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=00h05m05s">part was that you'd come up with a set
of ideas that were facts and then that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=00h05m09s">would be superseded by a different

that what happens that each theory in</a>

becomes more complete as the scientific</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=00h05m25s">what Kuhn meant by a paradigm shift

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=00h05m39s">then to nest that within a broader

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=00h11m18s">introductory paragraph is that the one

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=00h11m25s">ultimate fact is a fact about the way
people generate facts all right and so</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=00h11m29s">psays theory in part is a is a theory

not a study of the knowledge itself it's</a>

that's so cool about Piaget I think is</a>

there's a gap there and Harris and</a>

let's empirically analyze how children</a>

we can use controllable analysis and so</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=00h27m56s">you could say he introduced scientific

01:00:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h00m32s">knowledge representations as far as I
can tell there's a representation of you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h00m36s">and there's a representation of the

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h00m40s">use to transform one into the other and
so when Piaget talks about so this is</a>
01:00:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h00m45s">kind of where the mind meets the body
that that's how it looks to me it's like</a>
01:00:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h00m49s">you have a conception of you and you
have something you're aiming at you want</a>
01:00:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h00m53s">to have happen
those are both representations but when</a>
01:00:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h00m56s">you act in the world those aren't
representations anymore those are</a>
01:00:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h00m59s">actually actions and some of mine
transforms into body when you act out</a>
01:00:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h01m03s">your notion and that's that's sort of
how the mind is linked to the body as</a>
01:01:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h01m07s">far as I can tell and so what Piaget
says is that the behaviors are built</a>
01:01:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h01m12s">before the representation and so we're
going to take a look at that so here's</a>
01:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h01m18s">here's a Piaget a notion of assimilation
and accommodation whereas other animals</a>
01:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h01m24s">cannot alter themselves except by
changing their species</a>
01:01:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h01m27s">so that's through Darwinian means right
so what happens is a bear is a kind of</a>
01:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h01m32s">solution to a set of problems and
they're the problems that the bear's</a>
01:01:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h01m35s">environment presents and the bear is
just a bear so it's sort of like bears</a>
01:01:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h01m38s">were ten thousand years ago and the only
way the bear can solve a new problem</a>
01:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h01m42s">basically is by generating new random
bears which is what it does wouldn't</a>
01:01:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h01m45s">reproduce us and hoping that one of
those more random bears is a better fit</a>
01:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h01m49s">for whatever random change might occur
in the environment that's the whole</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h01m53s">Darwinian issue right you can't predict
which way the environment is going to go</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h01m57s">and so what you do is you take your
structure and you vary it and you throw</a>
01:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h02m01s">those out into the world and some

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h02m25s">strategies and you could think about all
those mosquito offspring as new mosquito</a>

the thing that's so interesting about</a>

you're doing is generating a</a>

and this is a pia jetty an idea - let's</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h27m17s">see yeah I'm gonna go to this for a
minute so so I'm gonna decompose</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h27m24s">something for you and and this is partly
to give you an introduction to the way</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h27m28s">behaviorists think but it's also to help

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h27m33s">and so from a piagetian perspective
high-order abstractions are actually</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h27m37s">made of what's common among actions and

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h27m42s">unified in some sense so an abstraction
isn't what's common across sets of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h27m46s">objects it's more like what's common

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h27m50s">and so that's a hard thing to understand

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h27m54s">okay so let's say you want to be a good
person it's kind of abstraction all</a>
01:27:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h27m58s">right
and then you think well what does it</a>
01:27:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h27m59s">mean to be a good person it's a box it's

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h28m09s">transforming things so but you know what
it means you say good person you kind of</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h28m14s">know and you kind of know but you know
if we started talking about details we</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h28m17s">might start to argue but it's like

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h28m20s">it okay so what does it mean to be a
good person well we could decompose it</a>
01:28:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h28m24s">we could say well if you're one way of
being a good person is to be a good</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h28m28s">parent and you basically say that being

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h28m51s">good at all of them whatever that means
well let's say if you're a good parent</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h28m55s">well you have to have a good job because

into play with baby or complete meal you</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h29m16s">might say well if take care of family
you can either order a meal or you can</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4VSRg4e8w#t=01h29m25s">well what do you decompose that into
well now you're starting to get to the</a>
