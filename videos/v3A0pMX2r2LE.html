<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h00m04s">You're very high in openness, and you're lower in conscientiousness or at least conscientiousness is irrelevant.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h00m10s">And the reason for that seems to be that like if you're an orderly person and you like to follow procedures and rules.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h00m15s">It's kind of hard for you to start a company because when you first start a company or engage in any other creative process.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h00m42s">And so it's people who are very high in openness who happened to be good entrepreneurs. And so, ...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h00m47s">this is something I thought was extraordinarily cool because</a>
00:00:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h00m50s">We'd also already known what predicts managerial administrative and academic ability.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h00m55s">And I.Q. is it crucial for any complex job so we'll just leave that behind, but</a>
00:00:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h01m00s">what predicts academic ability for example at The University of Toronto is, ...</a>
00:01:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h01m04s">is, ...Intelligence obviously, but also conscientiousness. The correlation between creativity and grades at The U. of T. is zero</a>
00:01:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h01m13s">Right, but it's not, it's not surprising. The is thing is you know it's easy to be cynical about that.</a>
00:01:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h01m18s">But one of the things you have to understand about creative people is that they,</a>
00:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h01m22s">they continually step outside of the domain of evaluation structures.  Right, because if you're going to say you're going to evaluate, ...ummm</a>
00:01:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h01m30s">The performance of a hundred professors on their lecturing ability. Well you kind of have to measure what's common across all the professors,</a>
00:01:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h01m37s">in order to come up with the standards for evaluation.</a>
00:01:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h01m40s">Well that means you're not going to be able to use that structure to evaluate a particularly creative professor, because</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h01m46s">he or she is going to do something in a way that's so different that it won't show up on the evaluation measure.</a>
00:01:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h01m52s">And then of course that's what happens in universities.  You know, um, somebody sent me a couple of days ago,</a>
00:01:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h01m58s">Somebody sent me an essay that they had written for their master's thesis that was wildly creative,</a>
00:01:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h02m03s">and they were basically told to leave the program and and that they couldn't continue.  Not in the mean way.</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h02m09s">What happened was that, what they were thinking was so outside of the conventions in the discipline,</a>
00:02:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h02m14s">is that no one had any idea what to do with the essay.</a>
00:02:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h02m17s">So then that's really the lot of creative people, right.  They're always stepping outside of evaluation structures.</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h02m23s">And so it's not that surprising that the relationship between creativity and Grades at The U. of T. is zero.</a>
00:02:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h02m29s">We found out as well by looking at graduate student performance across multiple institutions.</a>
00:02:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h02m34s">That there was a negative correlation between creativity and graduate school performance.</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h02m38s">It wasn't even zero it was worse than negative.  Being creative was negative. 
 And you think well that could make you cynical as well.</a>
00:02:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h02m46s">but, but, you can't be cynical in that way.  Because one of the things that happens in science is that</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h02m53s">Science tends to progress incrementally rather than in great leaps.</a>
00:02:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h02m57s">Now and then someone comes along who blows the structure out of a science and advances it ridiculously like Einstein.</a>
00:02:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h03m04s">But like most people aren't Einstein maybe thank God for that.  Most of the time, ...</a>
00:03:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h03m09s">You're in a discipline you you understand the discipline and then once you've developed understanding of the discipline</a>
00:03:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h03m15s">you know what the next micro question is that should be answered.</a>
00:03:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h03m20s">And part of the reason that science is so powerful is because it allows people who aren't genius level creatives,</a>
00:03:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h03m26s">to make real advances in the generation of knowledge.   One tiny micro step at a time.</a>
00:03:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h03m31s">Doesn't matter if there's a hundred thousand people doing it and each of them is making a micro step, man.</a>
00:03:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h03m37s">We're zipping along as fast as we possibly want to zip along.</a>
00:03:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h03m40s">And so it turns out to be conscientiousness that's the excellent predictor of graduate student performance.</a>
00:03:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h03m45s">That's the best predictor for law.  It's the best predictor for managerial positions.  It's the best predictor for administrative positions.</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h03m51s">Anything that has a structure of rules that needs to be applied.</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h03m55s">Conscientiousness is a great predictor. So, but it's not good for predicting artistic ability or entrepreneurial ability.</a>
00:03:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h04m01s">And that's also really important because one of the things this is partly why bureaucracies stultify</a>
00:04:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h04m07s">right because what happens is as they develop they get chock-full of</a>
00:04:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h04m10s">conscientious people with a few psychopaths thrown in there just for good measure.   They get chock-full of</a>
00:04:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h04m15s">of conscientious people, busily zooming efficiently down a single track and then all of a sudden the landscape shifts,</a>
00:04:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h04m23s">and they're going very, very efficiently in exactly the wrong direction then the whole bloody thing falls apart.</a>
00:04:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h04m29s">So you need to have some creative wingnuts in your organization,</a>
00:04:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h04m33s">to come up with completely absurd ideas that might just on the off-chance be true.</a>
00:04:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h04m39s">And so creativity is strange in that manner too, because it's a high-risk high-return game.</a>
00:04:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h04m44s">You're a lot safer, in your life to find a functioning entity, and to operate as a cog within it.</a>
00:04:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h04m51s">As long as the entity keeps functioning.</a>
00:04:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h04m53s">Because, if you're creative and you go off on tangents all the time.</a>
00:04:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h04m57s">There's some probability that one of those tangents is going to be exactly what is needed at the time,</a>
00:04:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h05m02s">and you're going to become hyper successful as a consequence.</a>
00:05:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h05m04s">But there's much more probability that even though your some of your ideas might be highly valuable,</a>
00:05:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h05m10s">the probability that this is the right time and place for them is extraordinarily low.</a>
00:05:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h05m15s">So to produce a successful creative product for example in the market place,</a>
00:05:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h05m20s">you need a ridiculous combination of creativity, so that you keep generating ideas.</a>
00:05:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h05m25s">And then a, a,</a>
00:05:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h05m27s">a, network around you of people who have skills that you don't, and then the production of a, of a,</a>
00:05:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h05m33s">a product let's say whatever that happens to be that's actually in demand by the marketplace at exactly that moment, ...</a>
00:05:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h05m39s">and, that someone else hasn't already done better.</a>
00:05:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h05m42s">So the sensible thing to tell anybody who wants to be creative, is "That's stupid". You shouldn't do it.</a>
00:05:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h05m49s">It's it's your probability of success is so low, that</a>
00:05:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h05m53s">It's better just to do something sensible.</a>
00:05:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h05m55s">But the problem with that is that creative people can't do that, because they're creative, and if they shut down their creativity</a>
00:05:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h06m02s">It's like an extrovert who's going to live in a you know in an isolated cell.</a>
00:06:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h06m06s">A creative person who isn't being creative?  They just, ...</a>
00:06:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h06m09s">they just wither and die.</a>
00:06:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE#t=00h06m11s">So they're stuck with it. So, but it is a High-risk high-return strategy.</a>
