00:00:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h00m08s">You should try giving him an antidepressant.</a>
00:00:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h00m10s">Because if he dies, you can't help him</a>
00:00:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h00m13s">Well, if you're struggling, you're kind of bound</a>
00:00:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h00m19s">Hold onto any rope someone throws at you.</a>
00:00:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h00m22s">One of the things I do with my clients (patients) all the time, especially if they are in turmoil, is to tell them</a>
00:00:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h00m26s">Look, I don't know exactly what will help you.</a>
00:00:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h00m29s">But do not arbitrarily throw any possibility, because you may not have this luxury. "</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h00m34s">Antidepressants have helped many people, and there are technical reasons why.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h00m38s">...So</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h00m43s">So, if you are offered a gift from your community, and an actor</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h00m46s">Try it. I don't care about your assumptions.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h00m51s">Far from it ....</a>
00:00:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h00m57s">A lot of the time you see people suffering from depression, for example</a>
00:00:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h01m01s">There are multiple causes, but I'll take a common cause.</a>
00:01:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h01m04s">You can think of it in connection with the story of B (Peter Mann).</a>
00:01:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h01m08s">Peter Mann is someone who doesn't want to mature, right?</a>
00:01:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h01m10s">Now, the problem with Peter Mann is that he can be king, but he is king on Neverland Island, and Neverland does not exist.</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h01m16s">So being king over nothing is useless</a>
00:01:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h01m20s">One of the things you see a lot about people with depression.</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h01m23s">(And I do not blindly explain the causes of depression, because there are many of them)</a>
00:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h01m27s">People who do not have an adequate system in their life often feel overwhelmed.</a>
00:01:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h01m32s">For example, if someone comes to me, sees me, and says that he is depressed</a>
00:01:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h01m36s">I always ask them regular questions.</a>
00:01:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h01m40s">"do you have a job?"</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h01m42s">If you don't have a job, you are really in trouble in our community.</a>
00:01:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h01m45s">First, your biological balances tend to skew</a>
00:01:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h01m48s">Because there is no reason to sleep at a specific time, and there is no reason to wake up.</a>
00:01:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h01m51s">And for a lot of people, if they don't wake up at the usual time,</a>
00:01:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h01m55s">They deteriorate their vital circulatory balance, and this is enough to make them depressed immediately.</a>
00:01:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h02m00s">Especially if he falls asleep at noon.</a>
00:02:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h02m02s">Also, they have no purpose, and people are not good without purpose</a>
00:02:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h02m05s">This is not hypotheses.</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h02m09s">We understand the circuits that govern positive emotions.</a>
00:02:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h02m13s">We know how to operate, almost all the positive emotions that you will experience.</a>
00:02:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h02m18s">It will not be the result of getting things done.</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h02m21s">The outcome of seeing things will be operational as you progress toward a goal you are evaluating.</a>
00:02:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h02m26s">This is completely different and you need to find out.</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h02m28s">Because people are often amazed, for example, they finish their PhD theses</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h02m32s">And their assumption is that they will cheer up for a month.</a>
00:02:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h02m35s">Often instead they are depressed: and think</a>
00:02:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h02m39s">The hell I've been working on that for 7 years, and what am I doing now?</a>
00:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h02m44s">And that makes them depressed, is the question, "What am I doing now ?:</a>
00:02:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h02m46s">They are okay if they enjoy pursuing a goal,</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h02m49s">It's always useful, they get a lot of fun and enthusiasm.</a>
00:02:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h02m53s">Because that's how our nervous system works.</a>
00:02:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h02m55s">Most of your positive emotions are occurring while you are chasing a target.</a>
00:02:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h02m58s">If you use drugs, such as cocaine or steroids, the reason is because it is fun</a>
00:02:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h03m01s">It is because it activates the systems that enable you to pursue the goal</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h03m05s">This is why people love her</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h03m06s">So if you don't have a job, you don't have a structure.</a>
00:03:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h03m08s">This is not good, either. It tends to have no purpose.</a>
00:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h03m12s">So you are inundated with chaos and unfounded, and you have no positive emotions.</a>
00:03:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h03m16s">2) Well, do you have any friends?</a>
00:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h03m18s">So, sometimes you see people depressed: they don't have a job, they don't have friends,</a>
00:03:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h03m21s">They have no social relationships,</a>
00:03:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h03m23s">And they have an additional health problem, and they have an alcohol and drug problem.</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h03m27s">My experience was: If you have three of these problems,</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h03m31s">Almost impossible your assistant</a>
00:03:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h03m33s">You are so cluttered that you can't get out.</a>
00:03:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h03m35s">Because _ you come sideways, and one of these problems drags you down.</a>
00:03:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h03m40s">So one of the things I tell depressed people is: She</a>
00:03:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h03m43s">Don't sacrifice your stability, get a job.</a>
00:03:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h03m47s">Even if it's not exactly the job you want, get a damn job, you need a job.</a>
00:03:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h03m51s">Get some friends, get out on the dating circuit.</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h03m54s">See if you can establish an intimate relationship</a>
00:03:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h03m57s">Establish some of the basic pillar-shaped things for your life to base on.</a>
00:03:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h04m02s">Well, that's the practical thing.</a>
00:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h04m04s">This is one example of depression.</a>
00:04:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h04m12s">Well the point is, don't throw it at them.</a>
00:04:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h04m15s">You must negotiate with the person.</a>
00:04:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h04m17s">Also, you should teach them to negotiate with themselves, which is useful to know.</a>
00:04:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h04m22s">You can overwhelm yourself to do things, but I don't recommend that.</a>
00:04:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h04m26s">What I would advise is to ask yourself what you are ready to do</a>
00:04:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h04m30s">It's an effective technique, it's like meditation, for example</a>
00:04:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h04m33s">You can wake up in the morning, and you can think</a>
00:04:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h04m35s">I want to have a good day 'so I want to go to bed without feeling guilty.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h04m39s">Because, you know, I didn't do some of the things that I said I'd do,</a>
00:04:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h04m42s">And I want to have an exciting day.</a>
00:04:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h04m44s">So I have to fulfill my responsibilities, and I want to enjoy the day too.</a>
00:04:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h04m47s">Then you can ask yourself, okay</a>
00:04:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h04m50s">What do I have to do, to have that happen, which I am ready to do</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h05m10s">And you know .... that's a small obligation that you can get rid of as well</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h05m19s">Well: let's say that we try to define your goals, because you must have goals, that is, these goals</a>
00:05:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h05m23s">You might say, "I'm so depressed that I don't have goals."</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h06m40s">And you can start to fix it</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h06m48s">You know, sometimes people try to fix things that they can't fix, I don't recommend that.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h06m54s">For example, you can find all kinds of undergraduates, and they are ready</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h07m24s">You take two sets of undergraduates, put them in a lab,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h07m27s">And one group gives a test of multiple questions,</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h07m36s">But words are associated with younger age</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8#t=00h07m42s">And then you measure the speed of the undergraduates when they walk the elevator</a>
