<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi9BZUBDV9U#t=00h07m09s">possibility that the person who is being accused, so that would be my client, was actually innocent of the charges.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi9BZUBDV9U#t=00h07m17s">You know, and that's that's something that's useful to do for yourself if you ever run into trouble.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi9BZUBDV9U#t=00h07m29s">that you are. Right? Because everyone's entitled to a strong defense. And then just see how that flies</a>
