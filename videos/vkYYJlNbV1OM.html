<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h00m27s">The course summary basically contains The syllabus will tell you</a>
00:00:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h00m29s">Pretty much everything you need to know about the class.</a>
00:00:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h00m33s">This course has a textbook The... there's a text.</a>
00:00:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h00m38s">This is it. This is it.</a>
00:00:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h00m40s">It compiles key chapters in many books. It consists of readings from a larger text.</a>
00:00:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h00m44s">Although this book is very old, but I use it because it's old, but</a>
00:00:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h00m46s">Because a lot of the theorists that we are going to talk about are also old...</a>
00:00:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h00m52s">So it is very suitable for reading materials...and so I found this particular text accurate.</a>
00:00:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h00m58s">And many of the people that we're going to talk about are very...</a>
00:00:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h01m04s">Have very sophisticated views of personality.</a>
00:01:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h01m09s">So if you don’t read some of the same advanced articles And I think that it does you a disservice</a>
00:01:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h01m12s">It may be difficult for you to comprehend the essence of it unless you read something that's sufficiently sophisticated.</a>
00:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h01m18s">But if you read, at least you can So that you actually understand, at least to some degree,</a>
00:01:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h01m22s">Roughly understand their thinking what the people that we're going to study were talking about.</a>
00:01:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h01m29s">We may also start from the definition of personality. We might as well start, I suppose, with a definition of personality.</a>
00:01:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h01m35s">But it's hard to define something that's that general because...</a>
00:01:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h01m41s">Because when you're speaking about human beings,</a>
00:01:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h01m43s">It's not that simple to figure out</a>
00:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h01m46s">Distinguish personality from other what constitutes personality and what constitutes something else.</a>
00:01:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h01m50s">So I will cut into the discussion from several angles. But... So I'm going to hit at it from a couple of different perspectives</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h01m57s">At the same time and while I'm doing so...</a>
00:01:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h02m00s">I would like you also to consider</a>
00:02:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h02m03s">The nature of what you're going to learn.</a>
00:02:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h02m09s">Human personality is, essentially, unfathomable.</a>
00:02:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h02m14s">Human beings are unbelievable complicated</a>
00:02:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h02m17s">And the social environment we live in is equally complicated, and we're nested in systems that are also unbelievably complicated.</a>
00:02:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h02m21s">There are more patterns of connections in the human brain</a>
00:02:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h02m23s">The number of neural connection patterns between neurons in your brain than there are</a>
00:02:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h02m26s">There are subatomic particles in the universe. There are more subatomic particles in the universe.</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h02m28s">Much more by a substantial margin.</a>
00:02:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h02m30s">You can look up Gerald Edelman if you want to find out about that.</a>
00:02:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h02m34s">So it's reasonable to say And so it's not unreasonable to point out that</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h02m39s">You're the most complicated thing we know of</a>
00:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h02m42s">It's much more complicated by many orders of magnitude.</a>
00:02:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h02m45s">And the probability that you can understand yourself</a>
00:02:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h02m50s">Or the probability of having any overall knowledge is very low and anything approaching totality is extraordinarily low.</a>
00:02:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h02m57s">So this makes the study of personality something</a>
00:02:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h03m02s">It is daring and hopeless and complicated.</a>
00:03:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h03m09s">We will discuss a lot of theorists Now, we're going to cycle through a very large number of theorists...</a>
00:03:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h03m13s">You will find...and what you'll find is that</a>
00:03:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h03m14s">Although there are commonalities between them,</a>
00:03:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h03m16s">Their theories are still very different, there are marked differences.</a>
00:03:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h03m20s">You might think And so then you might ask yourself...</a>
00:03:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h03m23s">Uh Well...</a>
00:03:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h03m25s">If these theorists hold their own words What's the point of studying...</a>
00:03:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h03m27s">Then learn these theories one by one...this sequence of theorists and ideas if...</a>
00:03:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h03m30s">What's the point...there's no point of agreement between them?</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h03m35s">My answer is And I would say first:</a>
00:03:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h03m36s">First of all, they still have points of agreement between them.</a>
00:03:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h03m39s">Although...</a>
00:03:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h03m41s">Personality hasn't advanced to the point,</a>
00:03:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h03m43s">There is no one yet where I would say that we have a...</a>
00:03:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h03m45s">Undisputed unified theory...homogeneous theory that's free of internal contradictions.</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h03m51s">But I would also say that...</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h03m55s">Personality is a multi-field discipline...personality is a hybrid discipline.</a>
00:03:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h04m00s">It's partly science...</a>
00:04:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h04m02s">It's also about engineering...but it's partly engineering.</a>
00:04:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h04m06s">From a clinical point of view, I think personality is more like engineering. The clinical element of it, I would say, is more like engineering,</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h04m09s">The job of an engineer is to construct things and what engineers do is try to do things.</a>
00:04:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h04m12s">They are based on the theory, They try to make something happen.</a>
00:04:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h04m14s">Put ideas into action and they are informed by theory.</a>
00:04:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h04m16s">But the point is still to build something.</a>
00:04:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h04m20s">And when you're working as a clinical psychologist,</a>

00:04:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h04m26s">All belong to clinical theorists... little more than a third to a half of the course, are clinical theorists.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h04m52s">From a scientific point of view, it's not a straightforward thing</a>
00:04:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h04m54s">We can't exactly define mental illness to define a mental disorder from a scientific perspective...</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h52m00s">Please do that sooner rather than later.</a>
00:52:00</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h52m08s">Later, I will post some related information I'll post something that's quite useful</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h52m19s">At the end of the course I'll close, by the way,</a>
00:52:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h52m22s">Let me talk about who shouldn't take this course by telling you who shouldn't take this course. Okay?</a>
00:52:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h52m25s">First of all, if you didn't like this lecture,</a>
00:52:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h52m28s">Then don't take this course,</a>
00:52:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h52m29s">Because this is what the lectures</a>
00:52:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h52m31s">The same is going to be like.</a>
00:52:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h52m32s">They're not for everybody.</a>
00:52:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h52m37s">I use a lot of loose associations,</a>
00:52:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h52m39s">To elaborate the central idea and try to gather them back in.</a>
00:52:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h52m40s">I will walk around and I kind of wander around,</a>
00:52:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h52m42s">That way I can talk directly to you,</a>
00:52:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h52m45s">Which I like doing,</a>
00:52:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h52m45s">Of course I would sacrifice a certain amount of organization for that.</a>
00:52:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h52m48s">But my sense is that it's worth the sacrifice.</a>
00:52:48</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h52m52s">The second thing is there's a lot of reading, a lot.</a>
00:52:52</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h52m56s">Many of them are hard science articles. And a lot of it is, I would say, a lot of it's hard science.</a>
00:52:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h53m01s">Especially the last half in particular.</a>
00:53:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h53m02s">But the first half of a lot of it's</a>
00:53:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h53m04s">Discussing philosophical in nature.</a>
00:53:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h53m06s">Philosophical/psychological.</a>
00:53:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h53m08s">So if you're not interested in that,</a>
00:53:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h53m11s">For example, if you're a pure science type</a>
00:53:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h53m13s">Or not interested in clinical psychology and you're not interested in the clinical element</a>
00:53:13</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h53m17s">Unwilling to explore of personality, and in investigating</a>
00:53:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h53m20s">The philosophical underpinnings behind the clinical theory</a>
00:53:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h53m22s">Philosophy of those clinical theories,</a>
00:53:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h53m23s">You don't come, then I would say this isn't the course for you.</a>
00:53:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h53m25s">So you should take that seriously,</a>
00:53:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h53m28s">Because the readings are hard,</a>
00:53:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h53m29s">You need a lot of work for this course, there's a lot of work involved in this course</a>
00:53:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h53m31s">If you want to choose a course and it would be better if you took a course</a>
00:53:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h53m33s">It's better to choose the class that you actually want to take.</a>
00:53:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM#t=00h53m36s">So welcome to Psychology 230,</a>
