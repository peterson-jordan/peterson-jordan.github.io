00:27:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfdaAGZvYsA#t=00h27m48s">What is it precisely that makes men what makes men desirable to women and so I have a bit of a hypothesis about that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfdaAGZvYsA#t=00h27m55s">So here's what men do</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfdaAGZvYsA#t=00h28m05s">around that task because whenever you implement a task you produce a hierarchy and</a>
00:28:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfdaAGZvYsA#t=00h28m09s">They vote up the most</a>
00:28:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfdaAGZvYsA#t=00h28m11s">Competent men to the top of the hierarchy and then the women select the competent men from the top of the hierarchy</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfdaAGZvYsA#t=00h28m17s">But the vote that determines who the competent men are that are more likely to reproduce as a consequence of male</a>

00:28:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfdaAGZvYsA#t=00h28m27s">And so there's a spirit of the father that's embedded in the patriarchal hierarchy that acts as the primary selection mechanism</a>
00:28:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfdaAGZvYsA#t=00h28m34s">that offers men up to women and plays a</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfdaAGZvYsA#t=00h28m46s">But then there's something that's even more mysterious and deep about that. That's worth considering is that</a>
