00:01:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti1Tob5Ceh8#t=00h01m47s">If you play the game of your enemies, and you win, you win their game.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti1Tob5Ceh8#t=00h02m05s">So what does that leave people as, as an alternative? Well,</a>
00:02:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti1Tob5Ceh8#t=00h02m10s">I don't think that</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti1Tob5Ceh8#t=00h02m18s">It's a dangerous idea, and it's coming fast, and I don't like to see that.</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti1Tob5Ceh8#t=00h02m24s">I think the whole group identity thing is</a>

00:02:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti1Tob5Ceh8#t=00h02m50s">I think it's genocidal in its ultimate expression. I think it will bring down our civilization</a>

00:02:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti1Tob5Ceh8#t=00h02m58s">We shouldn't be playing that game</a>
00:02:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti1Tob5Ceh8#t=00h03m01s">So what's the alternative? You know, I've thought for a long time about a political career, really, forever, since I was like 12,</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti1Tob5Ceh8#t=00h03m08s">really, for a long time, and I've always decided against it because it seemed to me that the proper</a>
00:03:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti1Tob5Ceh8#t=00h03m15s">level of analysis with regards to the solution of the problem that we're facing</a>
00:03:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti1Tob5Ceh8#t=00h03m19s">isn't political, and that's why I think it's a mistake when what I'm doing gets politicized either by me or others.</a>
00:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti1Tob5Ceh8#t=00h03m26s">I think that the way that you deal with this is to put yourself together.</a>
00:03:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti1Tob5Ceh8#t=00h03m30s">I really believe that is that because I think that individual people are far more powerful,</a>
00:03:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti1Tob5Ceh8#t=00h03m35s">they're certainly far more evil than they're willing to consider, but that's also a sign of their unbelievable power.</a>
00:03:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti1Tob5Ceh8#t=00h03m42s">So, I think that what you do is you</a>
00:03:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti1Tob5Ceh8#t=00h03m45s">aim high and put yourself together and stay the hell away from the ideologues.</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti1Tob5Ceh8#t=00h03m51s">Because they're hiding, they're hiding behind a wall. They're not able to come out and fight on their own behalf and</a>
00:03:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti1Tob5Ceh8#t=00h03m58s">so the way forward through the ideological mess,</a>
00:03:58</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti1Tob5Ceh8#t=00h04m01s">and that's the lesson of western culture, is to place the individual at the place of paramount importance and to make the group identity</a>
00:04:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti1Tob5Ceh8#t=00h04m09s">emerge only when necessary, and secondarily, if ever, and</a>

00:04:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti1Tob5Ceh8#t=00h04m17s">You can do that tomorrow. Like, you can put your life together, and again, as I mentioned to the other young man who asked the</a>
00:04:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti1Tob5Ceh8#t=00h04m22s">question, is you won't hurt anyone doing that, right? You pick up your goddamn responsibility,</a>
00:04:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti1Tob5Ceh8#t=00h04m28s">sort yourself out fix up your family,</a>
00:04:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti1Tob5Ceh8#t=00h04m31s">right? And then you can be a force for good in the culture and if enough people do that the ideological mess will just evaporate.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti1Tob5Ceh8#t=00h04m38s">It'll just disappear.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti1Tob5Ceh8#t=00h04m39s">I think that's the way you show people the right path forward, too,</a>
