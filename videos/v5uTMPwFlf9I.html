					<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h00m02s">Well, here's the decomposition of the fundamental archetype.</a>
00:00:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h00m07s">The Dragon of Chaos differentiates on the one hand into the feminine. That's the Unknown.</a>
00:00:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h00m11s">And the feminine differentiates further into the negative feminine and the positive feminine.</a>
00:00:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h00m17s">The negative feminine is the reason for witch hunts, it's the reason for... um...</a>
00:00:17</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h00m22s">You know... There's a whole group online called men going their own way (MGTOW),</a>
00:00:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h00m30s">and it's a very interesting group to go study.</a>
00:00:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h00m33s">There's lots of them; I don't know how many of them there are.</a>
00:00:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h00m35s">Most of them are older; many of them are men who've been through a particularly horrifying divorce,</a>
00:00:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h00m40s">for one reason or another, and they're... they've had enough of women.</a>
00:00:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h00m44s">So, they tell the young men that they're teaching: never have a permanent relationship,</a>
00:00:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h00m49s">never share your territory with a woman, never share your possessions,</a>
00:00:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h00m53s">make sure you never live together, and don't stay with one long enough to enter a common-law relationship</a>
00:00:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h00m59s">because you'll be stripped of everything that you have.</a>
00:00:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h01m01s">Well, that's a hell of a thing to be telling people.</a>
00:01:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h01m04s">But what's happened is that the female has been manifested in their life only as the negative archetype.</a>
00:01:04</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h01m09s">And they've got that confused with all women.</a>
00:01:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h01m12s">And that's partly, you know, you've got to ask yourself if you know the mythological stories,</a>
00:01:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h01m16s">maybe if you made the right sacrifices, you wouldn't have so much trouble with women.</a>
00:01:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h01m20s">It's a good question to ask yourself first.</a>
00:01:20</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h01m23s">And I would also say, you know, if you're a woman who has trouble with men,</a>
00:01:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h01m28s">or you're a man who has trouble with women,</a>
00:01:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h01m30s">it's not the women, and it's not the men. It's you!</a>
00:01:30</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h01m33s">Because the women are telling you what's wrong with you.</a>
00:01:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h01m36s">And the men are telling you what's wrong with you.</a>
00:01:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h01m39s">And if you don't listen, then it's you. It's either you, or all men.</a>
00:01:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h01m43s">Well, that's easy, it's all men. Well, that's certainly how it's played out in the world right now! :/</a>
00:01:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h01m47s">It's like, no, it's not all men! You can be sure... By definition. By definition.</a>
00:01:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h01m53s">And it's not all women. That's for sure.</a>
00:01:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h01m55s">I don't want to have anything to do with women. It's like, you're a pathetic weasel.</a>
00:01:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uTMPwFlf9I#t=00h02m00s">That's the same statement.</a>
