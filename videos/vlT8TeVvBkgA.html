<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h08m33s">So the story starts like this.</a>

00:08:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h09m01s">why water would be considered the element

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h09m05s">that brings life forth, and we know from an

00:09:09</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h09m14s">is no trivial conclusion.</a>

00:09:27</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h09m29s">So Tiamat is this horrible creature that lurks
at the bottom of the primal element, all right.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h09m35s">Now she has a husband, Apsu.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h09m37s">Now the Mesopotamian creation myth doesn’t
say much about Apsu.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h09m44s">And we know from reading other sources of

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h09m59s">is Order or Culture, okay, and then the Mesopotamians
don’t say much about that, that doesn’t,</a>
00:09:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h10m05s">the development of the idea of Apsu or Order

00:10:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h10m14s">Okay so Tiamat and Apsu are locked into a
kind of sexual embrace according to the Mesopotamian</a>

00:10:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h10m23s">It kinda means two things.</a>
00:10:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h10m24s">It means that they’re not really distinguishable

00:10:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h10m29s">and it also means that they’re up to something
creative because the act of sexual congress</a>

00:10:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h10m41s">or as representation of the probability of
some new form coming to be, right.</a>
00:10:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h10m47s">All right.</a>
00:10:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h10m49s">So Apsu and Tiamat are locked into this embrace
in a state that other creation myths describe</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h10m57s">as egg-like, the Pre-Cosmogonic egg, their

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h11m23s">Well what does that mean exactly?</a>
00:11:23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h11m27s">Well it means something like this.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h11m44s">Well it means if you do things, you get in

00:11:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h11m46s">It means even if you’re trying to solve

00:23:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h23m35s">Well because we can take the world apart with
our hands and put it together in new ways</a>
00:23:35</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h23m39s">and then we can code what we’ve done verbally

00:24:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h24m15s">They take their king and they bring him outside

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h24m18s">Now you have to understand that outside the

you’re in chaos.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h24m37s">so he’s reduced to his essence fundamentally,

00:24:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h24m50s">everything he did in the
last year that wasn’t up to Marduk standards,</a>
00:24:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h24m53s">so to speak.</a>
00:24:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h24m54s">And you can see, that’d be a pretty useful
thing to have somebody who’s in power do</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h24m58s">on a regular basis, right, because it reminds
them that they’re in fact subject to a trans-personal</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h25m44s">Now why the hell
would that be, because Tiamat’s a dragon,</a>
00:25:44</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h25m46s">right, a horrible man-eating dragon that lives
at the bottom of the ocean which is to say</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h25m51s">that in any encounter with the
unknown, as difficult traumatic and violent</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h25m57s">as that might be, there’s also the possibility
for something creative to emerge as a consequence,</a>
00:25:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h26m02s">right, because it’s out of the
unknown that we mine new information</a>
00:26:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h26m09s">So insofar as the Mesopotamian emperor acted
out the role of Marduk, then he was a good</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h26m15s">emperor, then he deserved his sovereignty

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT8TeVvBkgA#t=00h26m38s">OK, so that’s a pretty interesting story
and it gets even more interesting when you</a>
