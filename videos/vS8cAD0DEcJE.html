00:00:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h00m03s">and that is, I would say, one of the main obstacles to enlightenment was</a>
00:00:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h00m07s">that when you start looking for motives for your bad behavior,</a>
00:00:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h00m12s">and by that I mean something very specific.</a>
00:00:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h00m15s">I don't mean it when you're misbehaving by someone else's standards.</a>
00:00:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h00m21s">I mean, when you're doing something dishonest, evil by your standards</a>
00:00:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h00m25s">and vile. You know it and you do it anyway.</a>
00:00:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h00m28s">So this is your own assessment.</a>
00:00:28</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h00m31s">If you look at why you're doing this,</a>
00:00:31</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h00m34s">so the more you look, the deeper the hole you dig.</a>
00:00:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h00m38s">And that's basically the motive of Dante's Hell.</a>
00:00:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h00m42s">Dante's Hell is a story about ...</a>
00:00:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h00m46s">Unfortunately, I don't remember his name.</a>
00:00:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h00m49s">Maybe it was Dante, but I don't remember.</a>
00:00:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h00m51s">It is carried by hell by Virgilius, an ancient philosopher.</a>
00:00:51</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h00m57s">Thinker.</a>
00:00:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h00m59s">That hell has levels. It's a Christian version of hell,</a>
00:00:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h01m05s">because there are different kinds of hells, but this is the Christian version.</a>
00:01:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h01m10s">So on the outer edges of hell, where it's like in normal life,</a>
00:01:10</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h01m14s">are ancient philosophers.</a>
00:01:14</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h01m16s">They went to hell because they weren't Christians, but it's there</a>
00:01:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h01m21s">like in a cheap motel instead of real hell, you know?</a>
00:01:21</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h01m25s">So Dante goes deeper and deeper until he reaches the very bottom of hell,</a>
00:01:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h01m32s">and if I remember correctly,</a>
00:01:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h01m34s">at the bottom of hell, Satan himself is trapped in a block of ice</a>
00:01:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h01m38s">surrounded by treacherous people.</a>
00:01:38</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h01m40s">So Dante's idea was,</a>
00:01:40</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h01m42s">that the worst possible violation of moral behavior</a>
00:01:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h01m47s">is a betrayal. They are in the deepest level of hell.</a>
00:01:47</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h01m50s">I like this idea. I think it's true</a>
00:01:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h01m54s">because, if you believe me, you show the necessary courage to guide you through life.</a>
00:01:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h01m59s">If you are smart. You don't believe me because you're naive.</a>
00:01:59</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h02m02s">You believe me, even though you know that I have a lot of bad qualities and so do you, but maybe we can work together</a>
00:02:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h02m08s">and create something together.</a>
00:02:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h02m11s">We can count on our words and work together, but you are vigilant.</a>
00:02:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h02m16s">But if I break it,</a>
00:02:16</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h02m18s">so I will break your necessary faith in life and in humanity.</a>
00:02:18</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h02m24s">You can really hurt someone with that.</a>
00:02:24</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h02m26s">Sometimes it's the same with self-deception.</a>
00:02:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h02m29s">But you can traumatize someone so badly that they can't recover.</a>
00:02:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h02m34s">It's really awful for someone to do.</a>
00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h02m36s">Maybe it's the worst thing that was, Dante's idea.</a>
00:02:36</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h02m39s">In connection with that</a>
00:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h02m41s">is a very interesting read when you compare it to Milton's Lost Paradise.</a>
00:02:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h02m46s">They are metaphysical research.</a>
00:02:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h02m49s">They are metaphysical explorations of scary places where you can end up,</a>
00:02:49</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h02m54s">and where people end up.</a>
00:02:54</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h02m56s">And also a metaphysical explanation of what state of mind will take you there.</a>
00:02:56</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h03m01s">You may ask: Why does someone become a traitor?</a>
00:03:01</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h03m05s">That is a deep question.</a>
00:03:05</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h03m07s">You have your specific reasons for doing so, but there will be other reasons under them</a>
00:03:07</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h03m11s">and under them will be other reasons and below them will be other reasons.</a>
00:03:11</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h03m15s">When you get to the bottom, you will find the root reasons why you betrayed someone.</a>
00:03:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h03m19s">And if you look at it, it won't be nice.</a>
00:03:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h03m22s">Then your propensity for evil, say,</a>
00:03:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h03m26s">it connects with the general human propensity for evil and you will find out what you are capable of.</a>
00:03:26</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h03m32s">And that's Jung's idea of ​​a direct encounter with the shadow,</a>
00:03:32</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h03m37s">which is partly the topic of this seminar,</a>
00:03:37</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h03m39s">because one of the things I told you at the beginning was,</a>
00:03:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h03m42s">that I will help you understand</a>
00:03:42</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h03m45s">how is it possible that you could be a warden in Auschwitz.</a>
00:03:45</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h03m50s">And to fully understand it ... It's a terrible idea,</a>
00:03:50</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h03m53s">but let me tell you, if you want canines to grow,</a>
00:03:53</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h03m57s">so it is very good to understand.</a>
00:03:57</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h04m00s">We've already talked about your ability to negotiate.</a>
00:04:00</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h04m03s">If you're not a villain,</a>
00:04:03</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h04m06s">so you can't negotiate.</a>
00:04:06</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h04m08s">However, if you have it under control,</a>
00:04:08</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h04m12s">then you don't have to be a villain.</a>
00:04:12</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h04m15s">It's a real paradox. If you're just naive,</a>
00:04:15</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h04m19s">so you end up in jail</a>
00:04:19</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h04m22s">where a puppet driver controls you, which is useless.</a>
00:04:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h04m25s">It means you are in vain and you can be manipulated.</a>
00:04:25</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h04m29s">It wasn't because you were evil, but rather because you didn't have the skills.</a>
00:04:29</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h04m33s">Organizational skills, or sufficient depth.</a>
00:04:33</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h04m38s">You are good because you are defenseless. That's not good.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h04m41s">It is easy to handle.</a>
00:04:41</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h04m43s">Do you think: How to get out of it?</a>
00:04:43</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h04m46s">Partly because you watch people because you know what people are like, because you know what you are like.</a>
00:04:46</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h04m51s">But you also know what you could do and would do if you were pushed to do so.</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h04m55s">You don't have to show all this to anyone you're negotiating with to take you seriously.</a>
00:04:55</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h05m02s">So it's a weird thing, you know? One of the things Jung pointed out was</a>
00:05:02</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cAD0DEcJE#t=00h05m07s">that what you need to know most can be found where you least want to look,</a>
