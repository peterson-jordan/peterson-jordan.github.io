<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl0_mJrbPLQ#t=00h01m11s">the inter relationships we have with the world

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl0_mJrbPLQ#t=00h01m15s">so that’s basically how our brain is structured

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl0_mJrbPLQ#t=00h01m25s">but the categories that we use to do that

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl0_mJrbPLQ#t=00h02m22s">for structure in the unknown now those routines

00:02:34</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl0_mJrbPLQ#t=00h02m39s">so that would be the absorption the most fundamentally

00:02:39</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl0_mJrbPLQ#t=00h02m44s">cultural rules and their incarnation in you

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl0_mJrbPLQ#t=00h02m51s">if two of you share the same cultural structure,

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl0_mJrbPLQ#t=00h03m13s">So that’s the benevolent aspect of tradition
right the part that protects and shelters</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl0_mJrbPLQ#t=00h03m22s">so to speak but there's also an aspect of
tradition that’s terrible, tyrannical.</a>
00:03:22</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl0_mJrbPLQ#t=00h03m29s">it’s the part that marches young men off

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl0_mJrbPLQ#t=00h03m35s">It’s the part that says when you're a teenager

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl0_mJrbPLQ#t=00h04m13s">On the other hand it’s the thing that makes
you obey or face the painful consequences</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl0_mJrbPLQ#t=00h04m17s">thereof which can range from mere social exclusion

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl0_mJrbPLQ#t=00h04m32s">And so you could say most particularly again
that that’s a standard existential problem</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl0_mJrbPLQ#t=00h04m38s">it’s a problem that’s faced by people
in every place and in ever culture, balancing</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl0_mJrbPLQ#t=00h04m43s">the appropriate attitude towards culture</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl0_mJrbPLQ#t=00h04m50s">So the most fundamental representation of
culture can be portrayed essentially in this</a>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl0_mJrbPLQ#t=00h05m03s">that means is that all forms come from the

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl0_mJrbPLQ#t=00h05m32s">so on the one hand God offers security on
