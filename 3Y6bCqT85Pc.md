[hello everyone it's been a very strange
day so I'm going to tell you about what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h00m17s)
00:00:17

[happened and then I'll start the lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h00m23s)
00:00:23

[so I got up this morning and started to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h00m29s)
00:00:29

[put my day together and then I tried to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h00m31s)
00:00:31

[sign into my gmail account and it said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h00m36s)
00:00:36

[that it had been disabled because I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h00m39s)
00:00:39

[violated the terms of service with Gmail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h00m43s)
00:00:43

[and I thought well I didn't violate any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h00m48s)
00:00:48

[Terms of Service that I know of now I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h00m51s)
00:00:51

[set up a new YouTube channel yesterday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h00m53s)
00:00:53

[called Jordan B Peterson clips and so we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h00m56s)
00:00:56

[made some technical changes and so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h00m58s)
00:00:58

[thought maybe it had something to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h00m59s)
00:00:59

[with that and I had been shout out of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h01m03s)
00:01:03

[Google one other time years ago so when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h01m07s)
00:01:07

[you get a shout out like that there's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h01m10s)
00:01:10

[little form you can fill out and so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h01m13s)
00:01:13

[filled out the form and I said that I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h01m15s)
00:01:15

[had been shut out and that I didn't know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h01m18s)
00:01:18

[why and I sent it off and then I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h01m21s)
00:01:21

[realized one of my staff members called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h01m26s)
00:01:26

[me and said that she was locked out of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h01m28s)
00:01:28

[the YouTube account](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h01m29s)
00:01:29

[oh yeah the YouTube account is hooked to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h01m32s)
00:01:32

[the gmail account so that meant that I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h01m34s)
00:01:34

[couldn't get access to any of my youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h01m36s)
00:01:36

[videos they were still up and online but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h01m38s)
00:01:38

[I couldn't get access to them I couldn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h01m39s)
00:01:39

[post last week's biblical lecture for 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h01m42s)
00:01:42

[for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h01m43s)
00:01:43

[and so that was worrisome and made me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h01m46s)
00:01:46

[suspicious and then about two hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h01m50s)
00:01:50

[later or something like that I got an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h01m52s)
00:01:52

[email from Google and they said that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h01m54s)
00:01:54

[they had reviewed my request to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h01m58s)
00:01:58

[reinstated and that I had violated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h02m00s)
00:02:00

[Google's Terms of agreement or a Terms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h02m04s)
00:02:04

[of Service and they weren't going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h02m05s)
00:02:05

[turn my account back on and I thought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h02m08s)
00:02:08

[and they didn't say why they didn't say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h02m11s)
00:02:11

[anything I got there is no warning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h02m13s)
00:02:13

[whatsoever about any of this they didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h02m15s)
00:02:15

[tell me why and they didn't say why in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h02m17s)
00:02:17

[the email response and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h02m19s)
00:02:19

[I wrote them back and I said because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h02m21s)
00:02:21

[they said I could I wrote them back and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h02m24s)
00:02:24

[I said this might not be a good idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h02m27s)
00:02:27

[basically and you might want to think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h02m31s)
00:02:31

[about it and then I twittered tweeted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h02m34s)
00:02:34

[what had happened right I took](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h02m35s)
00:02:35

[screenshots and I tweeted and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h02m37s)
00:02:37

[contacted a whole bunch of journalists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h02m39s)
00:02:39

[because it turns out that I know a whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h02m41s)
00:02:41

[bunch of journalists and so and so then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h02m45s)
00:02:45

[what happened then was that I got a call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h02m49s)
00:02:49

[from the Daily Caller in the United](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h02m52s)
00:02:52

[States I had done an interview with them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h02m55s)
00:02:55

[last week which isn't posted yet and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h02m57s)
00:02:57

[they interviewed me and within 20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h02m59s)
00:02:59

[minutes posted it online and so they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h03m02s)
00:03:02

[have a fairly big audience and so that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h03m04s)
00:03:04

[was good and then somebody phoned me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h03m05s)
00:03:05

[from Ottawa and I did a live radio show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h03m07s)
00:03:07

[about that and that was good and then a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h03m10s)
00:03:10

[number of other journalists contacted me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h03m12s)
00:03:12

[and I sent them the information but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h03m14s)
00:03:14

[another one of my staff and actually my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h03m17s)
00:03:17

[son emailed me and he said look you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h03m19s)
00:03:19

[should hold off because maybe there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h03m20s)
00:03:20

[still a mistake here and I thought yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h03m22s)
00:03:22

[there might be it might be just a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h03m24s)
00:03:24

[mistake but then why in the world did I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h03m27s)
00:03:27

[email Google and they contacted me and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h03m29s)
00:03:29

[they said they would not reinstate it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h03m31s)
00:03:31

[and they didn't provide me with any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h03m32s)
00:03:32

[information so I contacted the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h03m36s)
00:03:36

[journalists and I said well you never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h03m37s)
00:03:37

[know maybe this is just a mistake so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h03m39s)
00:03:39

[let's hold off and then well I was about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h03m42s)
00:03:42

[half an hour later while I was trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h03m45s)
00:03:45

[get into my I used this AdWords account](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h03m47s)
00:03:47

[that's Luke link to Google I don't run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h03m49s)
00:03:49

[ads on my videos but I need the AdWords](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h03m52s)

[account because it helps me add some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h03m54s)
00:03:54

[little gadgets to the videos that I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h03m55s)
00:03:55

[wouldn't otherwise be able to and I was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h03m57s)
00:03:57

[I was playing with that the system came](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h04m00s)
00:04:00

[back online I thought well that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h04m03s)
00:04:03

[interesting and lots of people had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h04m05s)
00:04:05

[emailed me and twittered me and some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h04m07s)
00:04:07

[people within Google and some people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h04m09s)
00:04:09

[elsewhere and they were doing whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h04m11s)
00:04:11

[they were going to do to help me get all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h04m12s)
00:04:12

[this material back up and running and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h04m14s)
00:04:14

[something worked my suspicions are that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h04m17s)
00:04:17

[what worked was the publicity now so but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h04m20s)
00:04:20

[maybe not you know and it's very weird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h04m22s)
00:04:22

[being in this situation because there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h04m25s)
00:04:25

[has been a number of recent episodes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h04m28s)
00:04:28

[where these larger companies Facebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h04m31s)

[not that it's a massive company but it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h04m34s)
00:04:34

[starting to become reasonably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h04m36s)

[arbitrary grounds to shut down their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h04m41s)
00:04:41

[users and this is very ominous to me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h04m44s)
00:04:44

[partly because we've we've turned our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h04m47s)
00:04:47

[communications over to very large](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h04m49s)
00:04:49

[systems or very large systems have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h04m51s)
00:04:51

[emerged to mediate our communication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h04m53s)
00:04:53

[right I mean there's lots of benefit to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h04m54s)
00:04:54

[it so you don't want to get too cynical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h04m56s)
00:04:56

[about it but we're blind with regards to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h04m59s)

[large organizations and that's really a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h05m06s)
00:05:06

[bad thing and something else is even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h05m08s)

[more ominous really ominous you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h05m11s)

[build political algorithms into our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h05m16s)

[artificial intelligence and this sort of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h05m18s)

[no one understands and that's a really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h05m22s)

[maybe I flew off the handle you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h05m32s)

[because I was sort of it was stressful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h05m34s)

[communicate but my calendar was gone and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h05m58s)

[that's a bloody disaster because like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h05m59s)
00:05:59

[I've got things scheduled out forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h06m01s)

[of useful alright so that was that was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h07m48s)
00:07:48

[part of what happened today and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h07m51s)
00:07:51

[anyways I still don't really understand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h07m55s)

[it right because I don't know why it got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h07m57s)

[shut down and I don't know if anything I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h07m59s)
00:07:59

[did got it turned back on and I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h08m01s)
00:08:01

[know the reasons for it and that's also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h08m03s)
00:08:03

[rather ominous it seems to me that when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h08m07s)
00:08:07

[I was thinking it through and was that I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h08m10s)
00:08:10

[know I have a fairly what would you call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h08m14s)

[it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h08m15s)
00:08:15

[respectable YouTube following I don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h08m17s)
00:08:17

[know if you'd necessarily call it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h08m19s)
00:08:19

[respectable it's fairly large YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h08m21s)

[following and it seems to me that it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h08m24s)
00:08:24

[would have been appropriate for Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h08m28s)
00:08:28

[if they were going to shut down my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h08m29s)

[account to tell me why I would think and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h08m33s)
00:08:33

[also maybe look me up maybe especially](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h08m36s)
00:08:36

[after I emailed them and then maybe not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h08m39s)
00:08:39

[to have emailed me back and said no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h08m40s)
00:08:40

[we're not going to reinstate you but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h08m43s)
00:08:43

[we're not going to tell you any reasons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h08m44s)
00:08:44

[that they didn't say they wouldn't tell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h08m45s)
00:08:45

[me any reasons they just didn't tell me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h08m47s)
00:08:47

[any reasons and then it also seems very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h08m50s)
00:08:50

[strange to me that it just all of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h08m52s)
00:08:52

[sudden went back on after two hours and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h08m56s)
00:08:56

[so well so I don't know what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h09m00s)
00:09:00

[that may be more information will come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h09m03s)
00:09:03

[to light over the next few days I hope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h09m06s)
00:09:06

[that I didn't jump the gun but it's very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h09m09s)
00:09:09

[a very peculiar set of circumstances I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h09m13s)
00:09:13

[thought it was kind of amusing actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h09m15s)
00:09:15

[that the video that they stopped me from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h09m17s)
00:09:17

[posting today was the last biblical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h09m20s)

[lecture you wouldn't necessarily think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h09m21s)
00:09:21

[that that would be the sort of thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h09m22s)
00:09:22

[that people would want to stop from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h09m24s)
00:09:24

[being posted but we're in very very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h09m27s)
00:09:27

[strange times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h09m28s)
00:09:28

[so that was my adventure for today and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h09m32s)
00:09:32

[so I didn't you know I hate speakers who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h09m37s)
00:09:37

[apologize to the crowd before they talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h09m38s)
00:09:38

[to them because you know if you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h09m42s)
00:09:42

[speaking to people and they put all this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h09m44s)
00:09:44

[effort into coming then you shouldn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h09m45s)
00:09:45

[tell them what a sorry and useless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h09m47s)
00:09:47

[creature you are before you talk to them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h09m49s)
00:09:49

[you know and ask for their forbearance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h09m52s)
00:09:52

[and forgiveness it's like it's a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h09m54s)
00:09:54

[you're a little late for that but I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h09m56s)
00:09:56

[still gonna do that a little bit today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h09m57s)
00:09:57

[because you know I wanted to spend all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h10m00s)
00:10:00

[day preparing this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h10m01s)
00:10:01

[I mean I've prepared it a lot before him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h10m03s)
00:10:03

[but that rattled me up a lot and so I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h10m06s)
00:10:06

[didn't prepare as much as I could have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h10m08s)
00:10:08

[anyways we'll stumble forward and see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h10m11s)
00:10:11

[how it goes I I'm I'm I'm reasonably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h10m15s)
00:10:15

[familiar with the stories now and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h10m19s)
00:10:19

[onward and upward so I'm gonna reiterate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h10m23s)

[this you know I've learned something I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h10m27s)
00:10:27

[have this idea that it would be a good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h10m30s)

00:10:49

[wouldn't consider myself nearly as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h10m51s)

[even more aware of how unbelievably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h11m05s)

00:11:15

[it's important it's so interesting the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h11m19s)

[way that they've set it up because you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h11m20s)
00:11:20

[can go through the biblical stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h11m22s)
00:11:22

[verse by verse and then for each verse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h11m25s)
00:11:25

[there's a whole small font page of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h11m28s)

[commentary from multiple sources and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h11m30s)
00:11:30

[you know not only is the Bible hybrid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h11m32s)
00:11:32

[hyperlinked in the way that I discussed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h11m35s)
00:11:35

[in the first lecture with all the verses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h11m37s)
00:11:37

[referring to not all the other verses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h11m38s)

00:11:46

[also although all the literature that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h11m49s)
00:11:49

[been influenced by it so it's it's it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h11m51s)
00:11:51

[an unbelievably central and core text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h11m53s)
00:11:53

[and it's so interesting to read a book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h11m56s)
00:11:56

[where every sentence has been commented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h11m59s)

[like I'm so ignorant about this there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h12m14s)
00:12:14

[all this work and and it seems that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h12m16s)
00:12:16

[we've left it to decay in the dust and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h12m18s)
00:12:18

[it's a big mistake man it's a big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h12m20s)
00:12:20

[mistake because the people who are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h12m21s)

00:12:28

[it's and it's some of it's outdated and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h12m30s)
00:12:30

[some of it you wouldn't agree with but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h12m31s)
00:12:31

[if you read all the commentaries side by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h12m34s)

[the thing about wisdom is it stops you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h12m39s)

[from running face-first into walls you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h12m42s)

[information is unbelievably useful you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h12m54s)

00:12:55

[realized that I want to return to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h12m57s)
00:12:57

[tonight because I've been thinking a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h12m58s)
00:12:58

[about this idea of the arc you know and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h13m00s)
00:13:00

[I think I mentioned to you last week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h13m02s)
00:13:02

[that I'd figured out that there is this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h13m04s)
00:13:04

[idea that Noah was perfect in his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h13m06s)
00:13:06

[generations and that meant that he has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h13m07s)
00:13:07

[said his family in order wasn't just him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h13m09s)
00:13:09

[but he had said his family in order and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h13m11s)
00:13:11

[because of that when when the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h13m12s)
00:13:12

[catastrophe came like it comes to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h13m15s)
00:13:15

[everyone he was able to withstand it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h13m17s)
00:13:17

[because he had the support of the people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h13m19s)
00:13:19

[who were near and dear to him and that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h13m21s)
00:13:21

[really important when things come along](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h13m23s)
00:13:23

[to lay you low like if you're alone and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h13m26s)

00:13:53

[ark is very very concrete in Noah it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h13m56s)
00:13:56

[actually a structure that that he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h13m58s)
00:13:58

[inhabits you know it's a concrete eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h14m00s)
00:14:00

[almost like a child's story and and I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h14m02s)
00:14:02

[not being cynical about that because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h14m04s)
00:14:04

[there are some bloody brilliant Charles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h14m06s)
00:14:06

[to children's stories but you know it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h14m08s)
00:14:08

[really concrete eyes but then Abraham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h14m09s)
00:14:09

[comes along and instead of an ark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h14m11s)
00:14:11

[there's a covenant right now it says in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h14m14s)
00:14:14

[the story of Noah that Noah walked with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h14m16s)
00:14:16

[God and and of course Abraham it isn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h14m19s)
00:14:19

[clear exactly did he's walking with God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h14m20s)
00:14:20

[or before God which we'll get into later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h14m22s)
00:14:22

[but you see I see this as part of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h14m25s)

[increasing cycle psychologize ation of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h14m27s)
00:14:27

[the sacred ideas that were acted out by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h14m30s)
00:14:30

[archaic people so first of all it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h14m34s)
00:14:34

[concretize in the form of a ship that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h14m36s)
00:14:36

[actually sustains you when the floods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h14m38s)
00:14:38

[come right it's it's very concrete](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h14m40s)
00:14:40

[imagery the sort of thing you might see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h14m42s)
00:14:42

[in a movie but then with Abraham it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h14m44s)
00:14:44

[turns into a psychological covenant in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h14m46s)
00:14:46

[some sense it's like a contractual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h14m48s)
00:14:48

[agreement now it's a country it's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h14m50s)
00:14:50

[contractual agreement between Abraham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h14m51s)
00:14:51

[and God but but that doesn't really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h14m54s)
00:14:54

[matter that I mean obviously it matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h14m56s)
00:14:56

[but it's that it's it's only it's only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h14m59s)
00:14:59

[half of what's important about that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h15m01s)
00:15:01

[other half is that it's a contract and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h15m03s)
00:15:03

[you know one of the things that you do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h15m07s)
00:15:07

[with your ideal let's say is you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h15m08s)
00:15:08

[establish a contract with it you also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h15m10s)
00:15:10

[establish like a social contract with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h15m12s)
00:15:12

[other people right that's what keeps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h15m14s)
00:15:14

[society organized and so there's this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h15m16s)
00:15:16

[idea that emerges in the Abraham stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h15m18s)
00:15:18

[of a sacred contract and that has the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h15m21s)
00:15:21

[same function as the Ark and what it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h15m24s)
00:15:24

[does because what happens in Abraham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h15m26s)
00:15:26

[we'll see more of this today is that he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h15m28s)
00:15:28

[you know God tells him to go forward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h15m30s)
00:15:30

[into the world and we've we talked about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h15m32s)
00:15:32

[that last week and he does that the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h15m33s)
00:15:33

[encounters famine and the encounters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h15m35s)
00:15:35

[tyranny and he encounters powerful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h15m37s)
00:15:37

[people who want to take from him what is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h15m39s)

00:15:44

[hard as it can be but there's this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h15m46s)
00:15:46

[consistent emphasis in the text and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h15m49s)
00:15:49

[think it's something really worth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h15m51s)

[that's speaking purely secularly I do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h17m15s)

[like you don't you don't have any idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h17m39s)

00:17:53

[things that God tells Abraham Kahn's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h17m55s)
00:17:55

[as as the story progresses especially](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h17m58s)

[every time Abraham makes a sacrifice as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h18m00s)

00:18:26

[a really bad thing and there's a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h18m29s)
00:18:29

[pain associated with that and maybe you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h18m31s)

[expand into a world destroying force](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h18m36s)

[no doubt about that so what is there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h18m39s)
00:18:39

[something superstitious and foolish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h18m42s)
00:18:42

[about attempting to establish a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h18m44s)

00:18:50

[that as a as an erroneous conception and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h18m53s)
00:18:53

[you know it's not necessary perhaps to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h18m57s)
00:18:57

[get lost in the details we can argue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h18m59s)
00:18:59

[forever about what God might or might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h19m01s)
00:19:01

[not be but we could at least say that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h19m03s)
00:19:03

[the concept of God is an embodiment of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h19m06s)
00:19:06

[humanity's highest ideal right we could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h19m09s)
00:19:09

[at least agree on that and then you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h19m11s)
00:19:11

[might say well is that real and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h19m13s)
00:19:13

[first thing I would say about that is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h19m15s)
00:19:15

[there's a lot of things about the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h19m17s)
00:19:17

[we don't understand and the second thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h19m19s)
00:19:19

[I would say is it depends bloody well on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h19m22s)
00:19:22

[what you mean by real that's for sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h19m24s)
00:19:24

[and that turns out to be a very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h19m26s)
00:19:26

[complicated question so okay so we left](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h19m34s)
00:19:34

[Abram remember at the end last time he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h19m36s)
00:19:36

[had just gone off to fight a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h19m39s)
00:19:39

[kings and get his nephew back which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h19m41s)
00:19:41

[seemed to be a pretty courageous act and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h19m42s)
00:19:42

[so that brought a story to an end and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h19m45s)
00:19:45

[it's interesting I think what happens in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h19m47s)
00:19:47

[the narrative is that there's a story so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h19m50s)
00:19:50

[Abraham is somewhere and he goes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h19m51s)
00:19:51

[somewhere else right that's the story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h19m53s)
00:19:53

[and he has adventures along the way and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h19m55s)
00:19:55

[those adventures are usually the typical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h19m57s)
00:19:57

[kind of adventure which is a riff in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h19m59s)
00:19:59

[structure of the story and exposure to a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h20m02s)
00:20:02

[kind of chaos and novelty and then a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h20m04s)
00:20:04

[reconstitution of the of the mode of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h20m07s)
00:20:07

[being so that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h20m08s)
00:20:08

[it's a classic story right you are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h20m10s)

[somewhere you're a certain way you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h20m12s)
00:20:12

[moving forward something happens that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h20m13s)
00:20:13

[you don't expect it blows you into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h20m15s)
00:20:15

[pieces it introduces chaos right you you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h20m17s)

[face the drag and you get the gold or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h20m20s)
00:20:20

[maybe the bloody thing eats you and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h20m21s)
00:20:21

[story is over and then and then you get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h20m23s)
00:20:23

[to where you're going but then the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h20m25s)
00:20:25

[question is well what happens when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h20m26s)
00:20:26

[get to where you're going and that's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h20m27s)
00:20:27

[really important issue because one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h20m31s)
00:20:31

[the things that happens to people all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h20m33s)

00:20:36

[don't know what to do right so for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h20m38s)
00:20:38

[example you graduate from university](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h20m40s)

[it's like okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h20m41s)

[the next day and so so what happens is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h20m49s)
00:20:49

[when you succeed then there's a success](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h20m51s)

[I've run this story to its end now what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h20m57s)
00:20:57

[and that's exactly what happens in in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h21m00s)
00:21:00

[the Abrahamic stories and they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h21m01s)

[something about why you're wrong and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h25m32s)

[commit to something that means that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h26m08s)
00:26:08

[don't do a bunch of other things right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h26m09s)
00:26:09

[and so that's the sacrifice of all those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h26m11s)
00:26:11

[other things you commit to it you set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h26m13s)
00:26:13

[your sights on it if you really commit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h26m15s)
00:26:15

[to it and you get the sacrifice right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h26m17s)
00:26:17

[to speak then the probability that that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h26m19s)
00:26:19

[thing will be successful vastly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h26m21s)
00:26:21

[increases and I think that that's also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h26m23s)
00:26:23

[not a naive or or a naive way of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h26m27s)
00:26:27

[thinking or a foolish way of thinking I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h26m29s)
00:26:29

[my experience has been that that's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h26m31s)
00:26:31

[case and so back to the dream I mean I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h26m34s)
00:26:34

[do think that we learn in trepidation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h26m37s)
00:26:37

[and that most of the time if if you have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h26m39s)

[to be laid low before the new revelation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h26m43s)

[can make itself manifest and I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h26m45s)
00:26:45

[that's also what happens to people often](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h26m47s)
00:26:47

[in psychedelic experiences when they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h26m48s)

[have a bad trip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h26m50s)

00:26:52

[it and maybe that's because there's so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h26m53s)
00:26:53

[much mess in their lives now I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h26m55s)

[consciousness makes manifest that it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h27m03s)
00:27:03

[like a little trip through hell and but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h27m05s)
00:27:05

[the mess is so complete and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h27m07s)

[comprehensive and all-pervading that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h27m09s)

[there's no way they can get through it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h27m11s)

[now if they could get through it and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h27m13s)
00:27:13

[started to sort those things out then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h27m15s)

[would you call it a compensatory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h27m19s)

[first thing is if you want to learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h27m24s)

[something is that you're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h27m26s)

[encounter well you have to figure out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h27m29s)
00:27:29

[what's wrong before you you can figure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h27m32s)

00:27:36

[right and so I think that that's what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h27m40s)
00:27:40

[the that's what this refers to I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h27m42s)
00:27:42

[that's the sort of psychological](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h27m44s)

[experience that that refers to I also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h27m46s)
00:27:46

[think we built this a little bit into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h27m49s)

00:28:02

[read it took me really it took me like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h28m04s)
00:28:04

[six months to read it and the reason for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h28m07s)
00:28:07

[that is that he reviewed about 3,000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h28m10s)
00:28:10

[papers and they're all neurological](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h28m13s)

[papers and and and heavy psychological /](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h28m16s)

[biological papers he actually read them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h28m19s)
00:28:19

[all and he understood them and he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h28m21s)
00:28:21

[synthesized them and then he wrote this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h28m23s)

[book about the synthesis and so and he's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h28m26s)
00:28:26

[very very careful with this terminology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h28m28s)

[that those rats were starved to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h30m14s)

[decision and to put something in your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h50m16s)
00:50:16

[life that's beautiful and it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h50m18s)
00:50:18

[unbelievably worthwhile to do that and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h50m21s)
00:50:21

[you have to steer clear of the frauds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h50m22s)
00:50:22

[and the con artists and all of that and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h50m24s)
00:50:24

[art is full of that of course because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h50m26s)
00:50:26

[it's difficult to distinguish between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h50m28s)
00:50:28

[the real thing and the fraud but but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h50m30s)
00:50:30

[it's unbelievably worthwhile and so back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h50m32s)
00:50:32

[to literature I'm telling you this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h50m35s)
00:50:35

[partly because I've been thinking a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h50m36s)
00:50:36

[about the humanities and the arts and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h50m41s)
00:50:41

[practically speaking because I know that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h50m43s)
00:50:43

[artistic types are also entrepreneurial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h50m46s)
00:50:46

[types they're the same personality types](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h50m47s)
00:50:47

[and so it's very much worthwhile to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h50m50s)
00:50:50

[an economic and practical case for this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h50m52s)
00:50:52

[sort of thing you study literature in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h50m54s)
00:50:54

[the humanities so that you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h50m56s)
00:50:56

[familiarize yourself with the wisdom of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h50m58s)
00:50:58

[our civilization man you should do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h51m00s)
00:51:00

[because people have been working on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h51m02s)
00:51:02

[thing for a long time and it's rich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h51m04s)

[beyond comparison so why wouldn't you do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h51m06s)
00:51:06

[that and you teach yourself to to read](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h51m08s)
00:51:08

[and you teach yourself to speak and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h51m11s)
00:51:11

[teach yourself to think and you teach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h51m13s)
00:51:13

[yourself to communicate and I can tell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h51m14s)

00:51:24

[that's so interesting about humanities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h51m26s)
00:51:26

[education that's at the core of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h51m27s)

[university it's like there's nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h51m29s)

[more economically valuable than teaching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h51m30s)

[people how to articulate themselves and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h51m32s)

[problems they can formulate solutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h51m35s)

[they can negotiate to consensus they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h51m37s)
00:51:37

[they can negotiate on their own behalf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h51m39s)
00:51:39

[on the behalf of others it's like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h51m42s)
00:51:42

[absolutely no downside to it except that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h51m45s)
00:51:45

[there's a responsibility that goes along](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h51m46s)

[with it but it doesn't matter because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h51m49s)
00:51:49

[there's no escape from responsibility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h51m51s)
00:51:51

[you can either take it voluntarily or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h51m54s)
00:51:54

[you can take it involuntarily those are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h51m55s)
00:51:55

[your options but there aren't any other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h51m56s)
00:51:56

[options and so we need to understand the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h51m59s)

[role of art and literature and and stop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h52m01s)

[metaphorically we cannot live without it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h52m16s)

[because life is too dismal and and and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h52m18s)

[tragic in the absence of the sublime so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h52m22s)
00:52:22

[and ourselves we have to be sharp so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h52m25s)

00:52:38

[a piece of literature because it's deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h52m39s)
00:52:39

[and because the people who wrote it had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h52m41s)
00:52:41

[at least one foot in the unknowable and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h52m43s)

[they're trying to communicate what they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h52m45s)

[experienced in the unknowable to make it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h52m48s)

[known and that's partly what we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h52m50s)

[trying to do in this series and what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h52m52s)
00:52:52

[you're trying to do while you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h52m53s)

[listening and all of that and so good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h52m55s)

[for that and also that nation whom they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h52m59s)

[and there's a psychological truth to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h53m06s)

[that too one of the things I learned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h53m08s)
00:53:08

[from reading Nietzsche because you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h53m10s)
00:53:10

[learn a lot from reading Nietzsche](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h53m11s)
00:53:11

[that's for sure he he talked about the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h53m14s)
00:53:14

[Catholic Church you know Nietzsche is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h53m15s)
00:53:15

[often construed as a great critic of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h53m17s)
00:53:17

[Christianity and and he certainly was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h53m18s)
00:53:18

[but he was no casual critic in fact I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h53m23s)
00:53:23

[think he was this sort of critic that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h53m24s)

[you'd like to have as a friend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h53m25s)
00:53:25

[because he was the sort of critic that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h53m26s)
00:53:26

[said well here's the great things you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h53m29s)

[done and that you could keep doing but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h53m31s)

[Church and he said what the Catholic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h53m39s)

[Church had done to the European mind in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h53m41s)

[particular was discipline it so that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h53m45s)
00:53:45

[over a period of a thousand years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h53m47s)
00:53:47

[thirteen hundred years fourteen hundred](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h53m49s)

[years there was this rule that there was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h53m51s)
00:53:51

[a conceptual structure within which you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h53m54s)
00:53:54

[had to interpret everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h53m55s)
00:53:55

[and what that did was turn the European](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h53m58s)
00:53:58

[educated you European mind into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h54m00s)

[systematizing cognitive entity and that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h54m03s)
00:54:03

[once that systematizing cognitive entity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h54m05s)

[had been established then it could free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h54m07s)

00:54:08

[disciplinary structures and go off and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h54m10s)

[do such things as produced the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h54m13s)

[Scientific Revolution for example which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h54m15s)
00:54:15

[required incredible systematic thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h54m17s)
00:54:17

[and so Nietzsche had this really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h54m19s)

[interesting idea about freedom and he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h54m21s)

[believed that slavery was an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h54m23s)

[know one of the things I learned from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h59m22s)
00:59:22

[Piaget at least in part was that his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h59m25s)
00:59:25

[idea of the equilibrated state which he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h59m27s)
00:59:27

[thought about as partly part of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h59m29s)
00:59:29

[biological basis of the idea of moral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h59m32s)

[progress it's something like that he was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h59m33s)
00:59:33

[a very very smart Piaget and we said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h59m35s)
00:59:35

[that the the proper equilibrated state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h59m38s)
00:59:38

[is one where imagine you have a family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h59m40s)

[you've got five people in it and you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h59m42s)
00:59:42

[doing what you want and you're in your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h59m43s)

00:59:45

[doing it in such a way so that the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h59m46s)

[four members of your family agree with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h59m48s)

[what you do and that it also facilitates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h59m51s)

[them doing what they want and what they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h59m52s)
00:59:52

[should be doing and so it's a really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h59m54s)
00:59:54

[tricky arrangement because it isn't just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h59m56s)
00:59:56

[for you it's for you in a way that's for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=00h59m58s)

[them and you could also see that that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h00m00s)
01:00:00

[would be something that would be a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h00m01s)

[multiplier right because if you have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h00m03s)

[everyone working voluntarily towards the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h00m07s)

[multiplying effect of that and then you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h00m11s)
01:00:11

[might think well it's not just you and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h00m14s)

01:00:21

[to take the time span into account and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h00m22s)
01:00:22

[then it should be you and your family in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h00m24s)

[a way that works well in society and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h00m26s)

01:00:31

[like sustainability at something like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h00m33s)

[the idea of sustainability and that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h00m35s)
01:00:35

[that's I would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h00m37s)

[say that's a reasonable way of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h00m38s)
01:00:38

[conceptualizing the holy city it's it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h00m40s)
01:00:40

[something like that you know if you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h00m42s)
01:00:42

[trying to make it concrete it's like how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h00m44s)
01:00:44

[should you live your life well let's say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h00m46s)

[you live your life in a manner that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h00m47s)
01:00:47

[justifies its limitation and tragedy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h00m49s)
01:00:49

[that's a good start but then let's say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h00m51s)
01:00:51

[that it does that in a way that also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h00m53s)
01:00:53

[reduces the limitations and suffering of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h00m56s)
01:00:56

[the people that you interact with and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h00m57s)
01:00:57

[now and into the future well maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h01m00s)
01:01:00

[there's a way to do that I mean a good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h01m02s)
01:01:02

[negotiation does that right because if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h01m04s)
01:01:04

[you're negotiating with someone like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h01m05s)
01:01:05

[your wife for example what you want is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h01m07s)
01:01:07

[for her to agree with the negotiation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h01m10s)
01:01:10

[and one of the things that Piaget said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h01m12s)
01:01:12

[which I think was brilliant brilliant he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h01m14s)

[said if you take an equilibrated system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h01m17s)

[let's say the father is a tyrant and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h01m23s)
01:01:23

[everyone is operating under his whip and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h01m25s)

[you put them in a head-to-head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h01m27s)

[competition the equilibrated system will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h01m30s)
01:01:30

[out-compete the disequilibrium system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h01m32s)
01:01:32

[because the enforcement cost is such](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h01m34s)
01:01:34

[that it will slow the system down you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h01m36s)
01:01:36

[know because you'll get resistances from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h01m38s)

[the people inside the system they'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h01m40s)

01:16:04

[half an hour later he called me up again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h16m06s)
01:16:06

[and he said look I just went out and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h16m08s)
01:16:08

[looked at that bumper assembly and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h16m09s)
01:16:09

[there's a plastic trim piece on the side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h16m12s)
01:16:12

[and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h16m12s)
01:16:12

[it has a scratch in it and I thought I'd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h16m14s)
01:16:14

[better tell you that just in case you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h16m15s)

[again ever I'm never gonna have any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h16m26s)
01:16:26

[contact with him like he made a bad deal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h16m29s)
01:16:29

[right because the part was worth more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h16m30s)
01:16:30

[than he decided to sell it to me forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h16m32s)
01:16:32

[but he stuck with his deal and then he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h16m34s)
01:16:34

[went over and above the call of duty he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h16m35s)
01:16:35

[said well this part that I'm selling you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h16m37s)
01:16:37

[to you for way less than it's worth is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h16m40s)
01:16:40

[damaged so I thought I'd better tell you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h16m42s)
01:16:42

[it's like man you got to recognize a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h16m44s)

01:16:46

[miracle so I said hey look it's thanks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h16m49s)
01:16:49

[for calling man it's okay I can handle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h16m51s)
01:16:51

[the scratch said the part needed and and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h16m53s)
01:16:53

[I got the car fixed and forgave Matt and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h16m56s)
01:16:56

[you know it had a happy ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h16m57s)
01:16:57

[so so that's trust right because I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m02s)
01:17:02

[didn't know him from Adam and he's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m04s)
01:17:04

[primate full of snakes just like the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m06s)
01:17:06

[rest of us and yet he was willing to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m08s)
01:17:08

[simplify himself to the point where I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m09s)
01:17:09

[could just take him absolutely at his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m11s)
01:17:11

[word and that meant we could trade even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m13s)
01:17:13

[though we were strangers it's like man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m15s)
01:17:15

[do not underestimate the utility of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m17s)
01:17:17

[and then there's eBay so when he Bay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m19s)
01:17:19

[first started you know the idea was it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m21s)
01:17:21

[not gonna work because you'll send me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m23s)
01:17:23

[junk and I'll send you a check that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m25s)
01:17:25

[bounces and that'll be the end of eBay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m27s)
01:17:27

[right and so these escrow agents popped](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m30s)
01:17:30

[up so you could ensure your transaction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m32s)
01:17:32

[with them for like 10% of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m33s)
01:17:33

[transaction they would get the check and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m36s)
01:17:36

[the goods and make sure that they were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m37s)
01:17:37

[okay and then send them on or ensure the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m40s)
01:17:40

[transaction but what happened was the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m42s)
01:17:42

[escrow agents didn't make any money and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m44s)
01:17:44

[the reason for that was no one cheated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m46s)
01:17:46

[now you think about how amazing that is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m49s)
01:17:49

[right you bring these people together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m50s)
01:17:50

[across a whole continent they've never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m52s)
01:17:52

[seen each other before they're never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m54s)

[going to interact with each other again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m56s)
01:17:56

[and this was before there were any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m57s)
01:17:57

[reputation ratings on eBay and yet the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h17m59s)
01:17:59

[produced it produced a tremendous amount](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h18m16s)
01:18:16

[of capital that was previously frozen so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h18m18s)
01:18:18

[frozen capital is when you've invested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h18m20s)

[talk about love because it's a word that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h52m56s)
01:52:56

[people have mouths to death you know as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h52m58s)
01:52:58

[soon as you start talking about love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h52m59s)
01:52:59

[then people should just go into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h53m01s)
01:53:01

[different room and and not listen to you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h53m03s)

[sappy and new-agey just like that and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h53m08s)
01:53:08

[and I don't like that at all but but it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h53m11s)
01:53:11

[still has something that has to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h53m12s)
01:53:12

[contended with and I think so I've been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h53m15s)
01:53:15

[trying to conceptualize let's say what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h53m17s)
01:53:17

[this covenant might might constitute and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h53m20s)
01:53:20

[I think the love part so here's this so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h53m23s)
01:53:23

[you know there's this book by Goethe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h53m25s)
01:53:25

[called Faust and it's in two volumes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h53m28s)
01:53:28

[first one and falls to logically enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h53m30s)
01:53:30

[one was written much later than the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h53m32s)
01:53:32

[other and Faust basically sells the soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h53m35s)
01:53:35

[to the devil for foreknowledge and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h53m38s)
01:53:38

[devil in Faust is mephistopheles and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h53m40s)
01:53:40

[mephistopheles is quite a well-developed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h53m42s)
01:53:42

[character and Bertha has Memphis dollies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h53m45s)
01:53:45

[say what he's about which is really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h53m47s)
01:53:47

[quite cool so it's like the adversary of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h53m50s)
01:53:50

[the world evil itself gets a chance to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h53m53s)
01:53:53

[speak and make its case and Goethe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h53m56s)
01:53:56

[thought this was so important that he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h53m57s)
01:53:57

[actually had Memphis Tov Lee's announced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h53m59s)
01:53:59

[himself once in Faust one and then using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h54m02s)
01:54:02

[the same words you know phrase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h54m04s)
01:54:04

[differently again in in part two it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h54m07s)
01:54:07

[really struck me it really struck me and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h54m08s)
01:54:08

[so what Memphis dolefully says is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h54m12s)
01:54:12

[the world is such a charter house of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h54m17s)
01:54:17

[suffering and destruction that it would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h54m19s)
01:54:19

[be better if it never existed and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h54m21s)
01:54:21

[that what he's working to is to bring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h54m24s)
01:54:24

[existence to an end because it is not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h54m27s)
01:54:27

[justified by its suffering that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h54m30s)
01:54:30

[like--that's it's an argument very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=01h54m32s)

[can get isolated rats to do that so and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h00m14s)

02:01:09

[part of it is to set your sights high](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h01m12s)
02:01:12

[and make a plan and figure out who you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h01m15s)

[better to do and it also interferes so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h01m35s)

02:03:43

[strange and but but one thing I thought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h03m46s)
02:03:46

[about I was out on the lake I was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h03m48s)
02:03:48

[canoeing around and I thought I had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h03m50s)
02:03:50

[thought about war you know because I was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h03m53s)
02:03:53

[very irritated I'm very irritated about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h03m56s)

[what's happened to the universities and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h03m59s)
02:03:59

[there's a hint of malevolence about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h04m01s)
02:04:01

[and I I'm not a fan of ideological](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h04m03s)
02:04:03

[possession and I've been set back up on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h04m08s)
02:04:08

[my heels a lot over the last eight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h04m10s)
02:04:10

[months by the the onslaught of what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h04m15s)
02:04:15

[emerged when I said that there was words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h04m17s)
02:04:17

[I wouldn't say and so it's put me into a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h04m22s)
02:04:22

[defensive posture let's say and I had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h04m25s)
02:04:25

[been thinking in terms of war metaphors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h04m27s)
02:04:27

[you know like this is a battleground and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h04m32s)
02:04:32

[that there's a war going on an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h04m33s)
02:04:33

[ideological war and I do believe that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h04m36s)
02:04:36

[that's true but then I was reading and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h04m41s)
02:04:41

[did this partly for this course I was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h04m43s)
02:04:43

[reading the Sermon on the Mount and one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h04m45s)
02:04:45

[of the things that says is resist not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h04m46s)
02:04:46

[evil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h04m47s)
02:04:47

[and I don't know what to make of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h04m50s)
02:04:50

[line and so I was talking to a bunch of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h04m53s)
02:04:53

[people about it and reading about it a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h04m55s)
02:04:55

[lot and trying to figure out what it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h04m56s)
02:04:56

[meant and partly what it means is don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h04m58s)
02:04:58

[waste time right because when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h05m01s)
02:05:01

[fighting against something then there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h05m02s)
02:05:02

[something else you're not doing and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h05m05s)
02:05:05

[I thought also when I was out there on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h05m06s)
02:05:06

[the lake I thought well do I really want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h05m07s)
02:05:07

[to be in a war because of war that's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h05m09s)
02:05:09

[that's not that's not that's not heaven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h05m14s)
02:05:14

[that's for sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h05m16s)
02:05:16

[it's really stressful and people get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h05m17s)
02:05:17

02:05:20

[just the wrong way of thinking about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h05m22s)
02:05:22

[even though there's a battleground issue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h05m23s)
02:05:23

[here and I thought well wait a second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h05m27s)
02:05:27

[maybe maybe the right thing to do in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h05m30s)
02:05:30

[situation like this and this is maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h05m32s)
02:05:32

[something that those on the alt-right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h05m34s)
02:05:34

[might consider is that the right thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h05m38s)
02:05:38

[to do maybe is to outline a better way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h05m41s)
02:05:41

[rather than go up directly on the attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h05m44s)
02:05:44

[now that might be seem somewhat at odds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h05m47s)
02:05:47

[with my idea of the website and perhaps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h05m49s)
02:05:49

[it is somewhat a towards without I'm I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h05m52s)
02:05:52

[not sure about that but what I'm trying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h05m54s)
02:05:54

[to do instead of conducting this like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h05m57s)
02:05:57

[war let's say is to conduct it like a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h06m00s)
02:06:00

[movement towards something better and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h06m03s)
02:06:03

[and that would be better now with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h06m05s)
02:06:05

[regards to cutting the universities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h06m07s)
02:06:07

[funding I thought about that too and I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h06m08s)
02:06:08

[thought wait a second that's not going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h06m10s)
02:06:10

[to work out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h06m10s)
02:06:10

[because it's inviting political](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h06m12s)
02:06:12

[interference into higher education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h06m14s)
02:06:14

[now the political interference might be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h06m17s)
02:06:17

[of the counterbalancing kind because the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h06m19s)
02:06:19

[evidence that the humanities in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h06m20s)
02:06:20

[particular have tilted almost a hundred](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h06m22s)
02:06:22

[percent to the left is overwhelming and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h06m25s)
02:06:25

[so maybe some counterbalance from the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h06m28s)
02:06:28

[right would set things more towards the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h06m29s)
02:06:29

[middle but the problem is is when you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h06m31s)
02:06:31

[open up the door to political](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h06m33s)
02:06:33

[interference with higher education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h06m34s)
02:06:34

[content you can't close the door again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h06m37s)
02:06:37

[and so on reflection I thought that it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h06m41s)
02:06:41

[probably was a suboptimal idea and that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h06m44s)
02:06:44

[would be better instead was to and what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h06m46s)

[ago basically that was the original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h12m15s)
02:12:15

[Christianity then there was the Schism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h12m17s)

[of 1054 between East and West because of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h12m20s)

[actually came from the East so I think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h12m36s)
02:12:36

[that's why it's important that we look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h12m37s)
02:12:37

[at the most ancient types because those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h12m39s)

[about two parts of it in specific which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h21m15s)

[is the story of Isaac and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h21m17s)
02:21:17

[crucifixion of Christ and particularly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h21m20s)
02:21:20

[one of the things like that Christ says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h21m22s)

[on the cross which is my God my God why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h21m25s)

[because that's one hell of a thing for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h21m29s)

[the Son of God to say and you think that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h21m32s)

[would have been edited out yeah no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h21m34s)

[touched on the story of Isaac yet but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h21m45s)
02:21:45

[there's this thing the cult typology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h21m47s)

02:21:49

[basically the idea that what's going on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h21m50s)
02:21:50

[in the Old Testament is sort of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h21m52s)

[laying out of types for Christ and that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h21m54s)
02:21:54

[Isaac is essentially a type of Christ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h21m56s)
02:21:56

[because they have all these similarities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h21m57s)
02:21:57

[and so I've been thinking about it in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h22m01s)

[parallels between them in between Isaac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h22m06s)

[and Christ and one of the things I also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h22m07s)
02:22:07

[struck me was mostly the differences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h22m09s)
02:22:09

[between Isaac and Christ in the main](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h22m11s)
02:22:11

[difference it seems to me is sort of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h22m13s)
02:22:13

[difference in direction of sacrifice so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h22m15s)

[the sacrifices of Abraham Abraham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h22m17s)

[his son to mankind and I've been trying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h22m26s)
02:22:26

[to understand basically how that works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h22m28s)
02:22:28

[and in relation to the new and Western](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h22m32s)

[civilization for 2,000 years yeah well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h22m35s)
02:22:35

[there is these transformations of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h22m37s)

[sacrifice right that can so the next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h22m40s)
02:22:40

[thing that happens in these stories is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h22m43s)
02:22:43

[that the circumcision circumcision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h22m45s)
02:22:45

[starts to come in as a sacrifice and it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h22m47s)
02:22:47

[seems to be something like the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h22m49s)
02:22:49

[beginnings of replacement for sacrifice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h22m52s)
02:22:52

[of animals it's you know there's this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h22m53s)
02:22:53

[the psychologize ation of sacrifice so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h22m56s)
02:22:56

[first it's pure external and acted out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h22m58s)
02:22:58

[and then it becomes something that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h22m59s)
02:22:59

[more conceptual like it becomes embodied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h23m02s)
02:23:02

[in the form of the circumcision and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h23m04s)
02:23:04

[it becomes more conceptual and that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h23m06s)
02:23:06

[conceptual transformation keeps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h23m07s)
02:23:07

[occurring and and it seems to well it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h23m11s)
02:23:11

[culminates to some degree in this idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h23m13s)
02:23:13

[of the sacrifice of Christ who's who's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h23m15s)
02:23:15

[God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h23m16s)
02:23:16

[his son to mankind but the sacrifice is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h23m18s)
02:23:18

[much more complex than that right it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h23m20s)
02:23:20

[also Christ sacrificing himself to God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h23m23s)
02:23:23

[and and I think that the the issue there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h23m27s)
02:23:27

[is something like well let's say you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h23m31s)
02:23:31

[supposed to offer up the best that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h23m32s)
02:23:32

[have to God that's the sacrifice that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h23m34s)
02:23:34

[what happens with the high quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h23m36s)
02:23:36

[animals that that Abel sacrifices okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h23m39s)
02:23:39

[but there's something better than the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h23m41s)
02:23:41

[best that you own well what's that well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h23m44s)
02:23:44

[part of it might be well the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h23m47s)
02:23:47

[relationships you have with people are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h23m49s)
02:23:49

[you willing to sacrifice them to pursue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h23m51s)
02:23:51

[the highest good well then are you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h23m53s)
02:23:53

[willing to sacrifice yourself or your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h23m56s)
02:23:56

[son like your son might be that's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h24m00s)
02:24:00

[tough one I can understand the idea of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h24m02s)
02:24:02

[sacrificing yourself better I'm still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h24m05s)
02:24:05

[wrestling with this story of Isaiah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h24m07s)
02:24:07

[obviously because that's such a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h24m08s)
02:24:08

[complicated story and I do think it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h24m09s)
02:24:09

[reasonable to think about it as a form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h24m11s)
02:24:11

[of foreshadowing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h24m11s)
02:24:11

[at least the way the Bible is set up of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h24m13s)
02:24:13

[course people who aren't Christian would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h24m15s)
02:24:15

[agree with that but that that's fine um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h24m17s)
02:24:17

[the idea that you would offer yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h24m20s)
02:24:20

[as a sacrifice to God that seems to me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h24m22s)
02:24:22

[to follow quite logically because well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h24m25s)
02:24:25

[obviously you have nothing greater to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h24m26s)
02:24:26

[give than the best of yourself right so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h24m29s)
02:24:29

[you sacrifice yourself to the highest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h24m31s)
02:24:31

[good and that's part of the man that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h24m33s)
02:24:33

[part of the way in which humanity is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h24m35s)
02:24:35

[redeemed that makes sense to me that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h24m37s)
02:24:37

[just seems like for me that's that's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h24m40s)
02:24:40

[pretty straightforward psychological](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h24m41s)
02:24:41

[truth the son issue that's that's a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h24m44s)
02:24:44

[tougher thing to wrestle with because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h24m47s)
02:24:47

[one of the things I was thinking with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h24m48s)
02:24:48

[the with what Jesus says on the cross is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h24m53s)
02:24:53

[that one of the interpretations of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h24m54s)
02:24:54

[is basically that Jesus in that moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h24m56s)
02:24:56

[is human basically it's not this not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h24m59s)
02:24:59

[right it's just Jesus the human right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h25m02s)
02:25:02

[but that always kind of felt a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h25m06s)
02:25:06

[bit like avoiding the question to me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h25m08s)
02:25:08

[because you can't just pause it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h25m09s)
02:25:09

[something like the Trinity and then say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h25m11s)
02:25:11

[oh but in this moment that doesn't go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h25m13s)
02:25:13

[right that doesn't count so but if we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h25m17s)
02:25:17

[think about it in that way of like the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h25m20s)
02:25:20

[difference in the direction of sacrifice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h25m22s)
02:25:22

[and it seems to me that in the sacrifice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h25m24s)
02:25:24

[whoever is making the sacrifice serve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h25m26s)
02:25:26

[aims toward something so Abraham is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h25m30s)
02:25:30

[so reaching for the divine when he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h25m31s)
02:25:31

[sacrifices when he's going to sacrifice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h25m33s)
02:25:33

[his son and so though I mean maybe God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h25m37s)
02:25:37

[is reaching toward the human and so that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h25m40s)
02:25:40

[would make some sense of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h25m41s)
02:25:41

[interpretation that Christ is only human](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h25m43s)
02:25:43

[in that moment right that that it's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h25m45s)
02:25:45

[sacrifice is accomplished and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h25m47s)
02:25:47

[reaching down is accomplished but I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h25m50s)
02:25:50

[still after a question what do I make of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h25m52s)
02:25:52

[that because that's one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h25m56s)
02:25:56

[I mean it's useful to have a problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h25m58s)
02:25:58

[like that because it gives you something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h25m59s)
02:25:59

[to think about right and something to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h26m01s)
02:26:01

[study further and it's it's it's a it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h26m03s)
02:26:03

[a major it's a major problem I mean the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h26m06s)
02:26:06

[whole issue of well we could say well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h26m08s)
02:26:08

[what's the relationship between the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h26m10s)
02:26:10

[divine and the human which is obviously](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h26m12s)
02:26:12

[brought to the forefront and the idea of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h26m13s)
02:26:13

[Christ right but it's a personal issue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h26m15s)
02:26:15

[because part of the issue is what's the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h26m18s)
02:26:18

[relationship between you as a finite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h26m20s)
02:26:20

[entity and the transcendent infinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h26m23s)
02:26:23

[that surrounds you well there's some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h26m25s)
02:26:25

[relationship because here you are and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h26m27s)
02:26:27

[the transcendent infinity around you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h26m30s)
02:26:30

[exists so there's a relationship the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h26m32s)
02:26:32

[question is what is the relationship and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h26m34s)
02:26:34

[and we don't know that and and and it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h26m37s)
02:26:37

[dramatized in that story and so I mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h26m41s)
02:26:41

[partly the the reason that there's so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h26m45s)
02:26:45

[much conflict and confusion in that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h26m47s)
02:26:47

[stories because it's trying to bring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h26m49s)
02:26:49

[opposing things together right how can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h26m50s)
02:26:50

[something be God and man at the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h26m53s)
02:26:53

[time it's just like the genie which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h26m55s)
02:26:55

[the root word of genius by the way the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h26m57s)
02:26:57

[genie is this incredibly powerful force](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h27m01s)
02:27:01

[that can grant wishes right but it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h27m03s)
02:27:03

[constrained in this tiny little space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h27m05s)
02:27:05

[there's an intimation there that for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h27m08s)
02:27:08

[something to be real it has to straddle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y6bCqT85Pc#t=02h27m10s)
02:27:10
